§ I-1.001 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this title to regulate the subdivision of land so as
to: provide coordination of roads with other subdivisions and transportation
plans; set aside adequate areas for public uses, water and sanitation
facilities, drainage and flood control; foster efficient and orderly growth
compatible with the natural environment; prevent premature land subdivision
which may, in the future, make the reassembly of land for development more
difficult; protect and provide for the public health, safety, and general
welfare of the county; and follow the guidelines of the Comprehensive Plan.
(Ord. 14-04, passed 6-30-2015, Ch. 1, Art. 1; Ord. 24-01, passed 5-14-2024)

§ I-1.004 INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT, AND SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   Interpretation. In its interpretation and application, this title
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the county.
   (B)   Conflict. Whenever any provision of this title conflicts with other
legally adopted regulations, the more restrictive ordinance or regulation shall
apply.
   (C)   Severability. Should any section or provision of this title be
declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the title as a whole, but only
that portion so adjudged.
(Ord. 14-04, passed 6-30-2015, Ch. 1, Art. 4)

§ I-6.004 LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Lot arrangements. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in
securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with Title II of
this code and in providing driveway access to buildings on such lots from an
approved street.
   (B)   Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards
of Title II of this code. Where lots are more than double the minimum required
area for the zoning district, the County Commission may require that such lots
be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future
streets where they would be necessary to serve such potential lots, all in
compliance with Title II of this code and these regulations. In general, side
lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines (or radial to curving street
lines) unless a variation from this rule will provide a better street or lot
plan. Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for construction
of buildings, observing the minimum front-yard setback from both streets. Depth
and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial, or
industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and
loading facilities required for the type of use and development contemplated,
as established in Title II of this code.
   (C)   Access to lots. Lots shall not, in general, derive access from a major
arterial. Where driveway access from a major or minor arterial, state highway,
or county road may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the County
Commission may require that such lots be served by a combined access drive in
order to limit possible traffic hazard on such arterial. Driveways shall be
designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on
major or minor arterials. All driveway access points must be approved by the
appropriate road authority.
   (D)   Easements. Utility and drainage easement shall be located throughout

§ I-6.005 GRADING, DRAINAGE, AND EROSION CONTROL PLANS.
   (A)   Grading plan. The final grading plan for the subdivision shall be
submitted to and approved by the Planning and Zoning Board, the Planning
Director, Highway Department, and the County Commission. The plan shall include
the following:
      (1)   Final Site Grading Plan. The grading plans shall show the contours
with intervals acceptable to the Planning Director. The site grading plan shall
also show drainage arrows for each lot; and
      (2)   Final Grading Plan. The road grading plan shall show percent slope
for all proposed roads, drainage arrows, and location and size of culverts.
      (3)   Planning and Zoning Board, Planning Director, Highway Department,
and County Commission may require engineered stamped plans.
   (B)   Drainage Plan. All drainage facilities including on-site detention,
drainageways, detention ponds, and drainage channels shall be shown on the
drainage plan and are subject to the approval of the Planning and Zoning Board,
Planning Director, Highway Department, and County Commission. The plan shall
provide the following information:
      (1)   Existing and proposed contour lines and the surface water drainage
system, including any major alteration of the existing drainage pattern.
Drainageways and detention ponds shall be designed for a 25-year storm
occurrence. The contour interval shall be of such detail that the final
drainage pattern is adequately illustrated;
      (2)   The boundaries of all drainage easements and detention ponds. A
maintenance agreement for upkeep of the detention ponds shall be filed as a
separate agreement in conjunction with the plat;
      (3)   Individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general
surface water drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as
to avoid a concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent
lots;
      (4)   Driveways shall not inhibit or restrict the flow of surface water.
It shall be the responsibility of each lot owner to install and maintain a
properly sized culvert under the driveway when construction commences to handle
a 25-year storm occurrence, if needed; and
      (5)   Planning and Zoning Board, Planning Director, Highway Department,
and County Commission may require engineered stamped plans.
   (C)   Erosion Control Plan. Stripping of vegetation, and cut and fill
operations should be kept to a minimum, as should the amount of land and the
duration of exposure. Whenever feasible, development plans should be made in
conformance with topography in order to create the least erosion potential.
Similarly, as much as possible, natural vegetation shall be retained,
protected, and supplemented. Every effort shall be made to retain the natural
vegetation on all ditches and drainageways. Ditches and drainageways will not
be disturbed without the approval of the County Commission. The plan shall
include the following:
      (1)   All proposed land disturbance including areas of excavation,
grading, filling, removal, or destruction of topsoil and spreading of earth
material;
      (2)   Provisions for erosion control during construction will include the
sequence of the operations listed above, with an estimated time of exposure.
The proposed temporary measures to control erosion will be designed to
withstand two-year rain and be shown on the plan;
      (3)   Existing natural features which would add value to residential
development or to the community as a whole, such as trees, watercourses, and
similar irreplaceable assets, should be preserved in the design of the
subdivision; and
      (4)   Compliance with South Dakota Department of Agriculture and Natural
Resources with disturbance greater than an acre.

§ I-6.014 FIRE PROTECTION.
   (A)   General. It is the intent of the county to work with the Fire
Protection Districts and Fire Departments in the county to assure reasonable
fire protection service.
   (B)   Central water system. To work towards a reasonable level of fire
protection, the following requirements apply:
      (1)   Where a central water system is required, or unless otherwise

accumulation, and so forth;
         (f)   In areas with municipal type water systems, the following
requirements for fire hydrants shall be met.
            1.   For a required fire flow exceeding 1,500 gpm, the water supply
system shall be capable of delivering that fire flow for at least two hours at
20 psi residual pressure.
            2.   For all required fire flows other than those described above,
the water supply system shall be capable of delivering the required fire flow
for at least one hour at 20 psi residual pressure.
            3.   Fire hydrants in partially built-out or built-out areas shall
be installed at a spacing not to exceed 500 feet of vehicle travel distance
from a building unless the Fire Department having jurisdiction determines that
closer fire hydrant spacing is required.
            4.   In unbuilt areas, fire hydrants shall be installed at no more
than 1,550 feet spacing with provisions in place to install fire hydrants to
meet the spacing in the above mentioned.
            5.   The appropriate Fire Department shall approve the location of
all fire hydrants.
            6.   In residential areas, fire hydrants shall be supplied by not
less than six-inch-diameter main installed on a looped system, or by not less
than an eight-inch-diameter main if the system is not looped or the fire
hydrant is installed on a dead-end main exceeding 300 feet in length.
            7.   In nonresidential areas, detailed fire flow calculations shall
be provided and used to determine necessary pipe sizing.
            8.   Future development in the area shall be considered when fire
flow requirements are calculated.
            9.   Dead-end mains shall not exceed 600 feet in length for main
sizes less than ten inches in diameter.
         (g)   Perpetual maintenance agreements, covenants, and/or deed
restrictions that provide for the preservation and care for structures,
improvements, conditions, or areas so that they remain attractive, safe, and
presentable and carries out the purposes for which it was installed,
constructed, or required (i.e., weed plan, fire plan, water system, fire
hydrants, and the like). The county is not a party to any of the above and
takes no responsibility in their enforcement.
   (C)   No central water system. In subdivisions which do not have a central
water system, or unless otherwise approved pursuant to division (D) below,
provision for a water storage system shall be made with the capacity of such
system equivalent to a minimum of 2,000 gallons per residential lot in the
proposed subdivision and will flow a minimum of 1,000 gallons per minute.
   (D)   Dry hydrants.
      (1)   As allowed in divisions (B) and (C) above, a dry hydrant system may
be used as a water source where a local water source such as a lake or pond is
available and the developer proposes to use this source with a dry hydrant. The
dry hydrant shall be designed by a professional engineer licensed in the State
of South Dakota and located as follows.
         (a)   The County Commission shall approve all aspects of the dry
hydrant design and construction, including materials, pipe size, and system
fittings used.
         (b)   As a minimum, Schedule 40 pipe and component fittings shall be

minimum flow of 1,000 gallons per minute at draft.
         (d)   The water supply source for the dry hydrant shall provide, on a
year-round basis, the required quantity of water.
         (e)   The system shall be designed and constructed so that the slope
and piping configurations do not impede capability.
         (f)   All exposed surfaces and underground metal surfaces shall be
protected to prevent deterioration.
         (g)   A minimum number of elbows shall be used in the piping system.
         (h)   Suction hose connection(s) shall be compatible with the Fire
Department’s hard suction and include a protective cap. The cap and adapter
shall be of materials that minimize rust and galvanic corrosion.
         (i)   The system piping shall be supported and/or stabilized using
approved engineering design practices.
         (j)   Stabilization or equivalent protection shall be employed at
elbows and other system stress points.
         (k)   Design shall specify strength of materials, structural support
data, and appropriate aggregates and soil materials used to backfill piping
during installation.
         (l)   All connections shall be clean, and the appropriate sealing
material shall be used according to manufactures specifications so as to ensure
that all joints are airtight.
         (m)   System strainers shall be constructed to permit required fire
flow.
         (n)   Adequate working space shall be provided around the dry hydrant
to provide for a safe working environment and shall be accessible under all
weather conditions.
      (2)   Written recommendation from the applicable fire agency is required
if on-site storage is to be waived, and any such waiver is subject to County
Commission approval.
      (3)   Perpetual maintenance agreements, covenants, or deed restrictions
that provide for the preservation and care of structures and improvements.
   (E)   Wildfire mitigation plan.
      (1)   A wildfire mitigation plan shall be prepared by a wildfire

      (2)   The contractor shall consider and incorporate the standards set out
in the County Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP) as is applicable
according to best practices.
      (3)   The Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP) is a living document.
      (4)   Efforts to pursue implementation of a wildfire mitigation plan will
be beneficial to promote safer, more responsible planning and development in
the county.
      (5)   By giving more consideration to developing better roads, more
survivable space, more open areas, better water sources, and using more fire
resistive building materials and fire-wise building practices, there may be a
significant reduction in loss of values from wildfire.
      (6)   Providing a safer environment for firefighters and the general
public will help provide a higher degree of protection for values at risk.
      (7)   The CWPP is available on the county website at www.lawrence.sd.us.
      (8)   A wildfire mitigation plan consists of four phases. Each phase
coincides with a specific step in the subdivision process. The chart below
details the implementation of the phases with respect to approval of a
preliminary plat(s), final plat(s), and certificate of occupancy.

I-8.002   Appeals
§ I-8.001 SUBDIVISION REGULATION VARIANCE.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   The County Commission may grant variances from this title when
strict compliance would result in undue hardship to the developer/applicant and
if it would not adversely affect the public. The granting of this variance
shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this title.
The County Commission may not, by variance, permit subdivision for building
purposes in areas situated within the floodway of a flood of 100-year frequency
as defined by FEMA.
      (2)   The County Commission shall review the following criteria when
considering a subdivision regulation variance request:
         (a)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety, or general welfare or injurious to other adjoining
properties;
         (b)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographic conditions of the specific property involved, an undue hardship to
the owner would result if the strict letter of this title were enforced;
         (c)   The variance will not cause a substantial increase in public
costs; and
         (d)   The variance will not in any manner place the subdivision in
nonconformance with Title II of this code or the county’s Comprehensive Plan.
   (B)   Procedure. The applicant shall provide a written statement describing
the requested variance and the facts of hardship upon which the request is
based. In granting variances, the County Commission may impose such conditions
as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of this title
including the preparation and filing of a recordable document describing the
variance and conditions in full.

         LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). FEMA's modification or revision to an
entire or portion of the effective FIRM, or Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, or
both. LOMRs are generally  based on the implementation of physical measures
that affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source
and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the
effective BFEs, or the SFHA.
         LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (LOMR-F). FEMA's modification of
the special flood hazard area shown on the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map

§ II-6.011 PUD - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   (A)   General. To develop a PUD within the county, the property must be
rezoned to a PUD designation and conform to Chapter 17 of this zoning title.
   (B)   Intent. It is the intent of this district to provide flexibility from
conventional zoning regulations with increased public review for PUD Planned
Unit Development District projects in order to:
      (1)   Encourage well planned, efficient development.
      (2)   Allow a planned and coordinated mix of land uses which are
compatible and are harmonious, but previously discouraged by conventional
zoning procedures.
      (3)   Encourage the redevelopment of contiguous large lot parcels into an
integrated and orderly subdivision pattern, with particular attention to
developing an efficient and coordinated network of internal streets.
      (4)   Promote the clustering of residential structures and other uses
without increasing overall density of the development area in order to preserve
unique and natural features such as forests, woodlands, open pastures,, natural
drainage systems and scenic areas.
      (5)   Protect sensitive areas and areas with restrictive soil conditions
within development areas through clustering of uses on land more suited for
building.
      (6)   Reserve adequate public right-of-way within development areas for
the eventual extension of arterial and collector streets, including proper
width and spacing of such streets.
      (7)   Improve communication and cooperation among the county, townships,
land developers, and interested residents in the development of agricultural
land and redevelopment of existing areas.
It is not the intent of the PUD Planned Unit Development District to
accommodate or encourage the development of isolated small tracts where
adjoining parcels are not considered within an overall development scheme.
   (C)   Procedure. The procedure for a PUD rezoning will follow
Chapter 17 of this zoning ordinance and the procedure listed in this chapter. A
PUD change of zoning request consists of the following: (i) a change of zoning
application; (ii) initial development plan; (iii) final development plan.
      (1)   Change of zoning application. This request for rezoning is subject
to the requirements for amendment of the zoning regulations specified in
Chapter 17 of this zoning ordinance and the procedure listed in this chapter.

proposed residential buildings, the proposed number of dwelling units per
building, the number and type of any proposed nonresidential buildings and
their square footage.
            2.   The proposed maximum density of the development, which shall
not exceed the density allowed in the traditional zoning districts for similar
uses, except where unique physical, environmental or design characteristics
make such densities undesirable.
            3.   The proposed minimum setbacks which shall be no less than
those required in the traditional zoning districts for similar uses, except
where unique physical, environmental or design characteristics make such
setbacks undesirable.
            4.   The proposed maximum height which shall be no greater than
that required in the traditional zoning districts for similar uses, except
where unique physical, environmental or design characteristics make such
heights undesirable.
            5.   Proposed design features illustrating compatibility to the
surrounding environment and neighborhood, e.g., buffering/landscaping (the use
of fire resistive plant species is encouraged (see County Community Wildfire
Protection Plan for list of plant species)); lighting; signage.
            6.   Anticipated subarea development sequence.
      (3)   Final development plan.
         (a)   Prior to construction on any lots in the planned development,
the petitioner shall present a final development plan showing the information
specified below, to the Planning Commission and then the County Commission, who
shall have the sole authority to approve, deny, or amend said plan.
         (b)   The final development plan may be submitted in conjunction with
the initial development plan for concurrent approval on any subareas the
developer is ready to commit to a final plan. All the information required for
both an initial and final development plan must be shown for the area submitted
for concurrent approval, except that the developer may reference the
requirements of one of the traditional zoning districts as the development
standard for a particular subarea.
         (c)   The final development plan shall show the following information:

(Ord. 14-01, passed 6-6-2014, Ch. 6, Art. 11; Ord. 22-04, passed 4-21-2023)
§ II-6.012 FPD - FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The State Legislature of the State of South
Dakota has, in SDCL §§ 7-18-14 and 7-18-15, delegated the responsibility of
local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety, and welfare of its citizenry, by minimizing flood losses.
Therefore, the Board of County Commissioners of Lawrence County, South Dakota
does ordain as follows: “Lawrence County elects to comply with the requirements
of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (Pub. Law No. 90-488, as amended).
The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), is a voluntary program
administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a component of
the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and Lawrence County's community
officials have elected to join the program. participate and enforce this Flood
Damage Prevention section and the requirements and regulations of the NFIP.
NFIP, established in the aforesaid act, provides that areas of Lawrence County
having a special flood hazard be identified and that floodplain management
measures be applied in such flood hazard areas. Furthermore, Lawrence County
may elect to administer this section to areas not identified as special flood
hazard areas (SFHAs) by FEMA on the community's effective Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM), if the community has documentation to support that there is an
inherent risk of flooding in such areas.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of Lawrence County are subject to periodic
inundation by floodwaters which results in potential loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of
which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the
inhabitants of Lawrence County.
      (2)   These potential flood losses are caused by:
         (a)   The cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains that are
known to cause increases in flood heights and velocities;
         (b)   The occupancy of flood hazard areas by structures vulnerable to
floods because they are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from
flood damages; and
         (c)   Uses deemed unsuitable for floodplain areas or that do not
account for the increased flood risk.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this section to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare of the community and to minimize
public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by
provisions designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize damage to public infrastructure, including but not limited
to, utilities, streets and bridges that are susceptible to flooding;
      (3)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions caused by flooding;
      (4)   Minimize public expenditures on flood control projects;
      (5)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and are generally undertaken at the expense of the public;
      (6)   Protect and safeguard the welfare and safety of first responders
should an emergency response be needed;
      (7)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
      (8)   Promote that potential buyers are notified if properties are in a
flood area.
   (D)   Methods or reducing flood losses. To accomplish the purposes outlined
in this section applies following methods:
      (1)   Restricts or prohibits land uses that are dangerous to health,
safety, or property in times of flooding, or causes excessive increases in
flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requires that land uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controls the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
      (4)   Controls filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (E)   General provisions.
      (1)   Lands to which this section applies. The section shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard identified by FEMA within the jurisdiction of the
county.
      (2)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas
of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
in a scientific and engineering report entitled, “The Flood Insurance Study for
Lawrence County”, dated April 17, 2012, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRM), and any revisions thereto are hereby automatically adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this section.
      (3)   Establishment of development permit. A floodplain development
permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this
section.
      (4)   Compliance. No structures or developments including buildings,
recreation vehicles or manufactured homes or land shall hereafter be located,
altered, or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this
section and other applicable regulations.
      (5)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This section is not intended
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this section and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
      (6)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
section, all provisions shall be:
         (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
         (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
         (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes.
      (7)   Warning and disclaimer or liability.
         (a)   The degree of flood protection required by this section is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and
engineering considerations. On rare occasions, greater floods can and will
occur and flood heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes.
         (b)   This section does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This section shall not create liability on the part
of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.
      (8)   Severability. If any section, provision, or portion of this section
is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court, the remainder of this
section shall not be affected.
      (9)   Stop work order.
         (a)   Authority. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator or other
community official discovers any work or activity regulated by this section
being performed in a manner contrary to the provisions of this section, the
Floodplain Administrator is authorized to issue a stop work order.
         (b)   Issuance. The stop work order shall be in writing and shall be
given to the owner of the property involved, or to the owner's agent, or to the
person doing the work. Upon issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall
immediately cease. The stop work order shall state the reason for the order,
and the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume.
         (c)   Unlawful continuance. Any person who shall continue any work
after having been served with a stop work order, except such work as that
person is directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition, shall
be subject to penalties as prescribed by local or state law including but not
limited to the penalties outlined in this section.
      (10)   Penalties for non-compliance.
         (a)   In accordance with Section 59.2(b) of CFR 44, Chapter 1, of the
NFIP regulation, to qualify for the sale of federally subsidized flood
insurance, a community must adopt floodplain management regulations that meet
or exceed the minimum standards of Section 60. "These regulations must include
effective enforcement provisions." In accordance with Section 60.1(b) of CFR
44, Chapter 1, of the NFIP regulations, "These regulations must be legally-
enforceable, applied uniformly throughout the community to all privately and
publicly owned land within flood-prone (i.e. mudflow) or flood-related erosion
areas, and the community must provide that the regulations take precedence over
less restrictive conflicting local laws, ordinances, or codes."
         (b)   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located,
extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this
section and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this
section by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations
of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this section or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not
more than $500 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both, for each
violation assessed daily, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses
involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent Lawrence County
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation.
   (F)   Administration.
      (1)   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The Lawrence County
Planning and Zoning Director is hereby appointed the Floodplain Administrator

Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. § 1334) from which
prior approval is required;
         (g)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained;
         (h)   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the
State Coordinating Agency which is the State Office of Emergency Management,
prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of
such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency;
         (i)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation;
         (j)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data has not been provided by
FEMA the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize
BFE data and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source,
including data provided by the applicant, in order to administer the provisions
of this section;
         (k)   When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, no new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill)
shall be permitted within Zones AE on the community’s FIRM, unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point
within the community;
         (l)   Under the provisions of 44 C.F.R. Chapter 1, § 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain
development in Zones AE on the community’s FIRM which increases the water
surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot, provided that the
community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA
(conditional letter of map revision); and
         (m)   If the project is determined or reasonably believed to cause an
adverse effect on the BFE's, boundaries of the floodplain or any insurable
structures, technical justification for the proposed development shall be
submitted and the community may require a CLOMR or LOMR to be submitted prior
to permit approval or as a requirement of the permit.
      (3)   Requirements to submit new technical data.
         (a)   The property owner or developer shall notify FEMA by submittal
of a LOMR within six months of project completion when an applicant had
obtained a CLOMR from FEMA or when development altered a watercourse, modified
floodplain boundaries, or modified BFE.
         (b)   The property owner or developer shall be responsible for
preparing technical data to support the CLOMR or LOMR application and paying
any processing or application fees to FEMA. The property owner or developer is
responsible for submitting the CLOMR and LOMR to FEMA and shall provide all
necessary data to FEMA if requested during the review process to ensure the
CLOMR or LOMR is issued.
         (c)   The Floodplain Administrator shall be under no obligation to
sign the Community Acknowledgment Form, which is part of the CLOMR/LOMR
application, until the applicant demonstrates that the project will or has met
the requirements of this section and all applicable state federal, and local
laws.
      (4)   Permit procedures.
         (a)   Application for a development permit shall be presented to the
Floodplain Administrator on forms furnished by him or her and may include, but
not be limited to:

proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes
            2.   Location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special
flood hazard;
            3.   Elevation (in relation to mean sea level), of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures;
            4.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any
nonresidential structure shall be floodproofed;
            5.   A certificate from a registered professional engineer or
architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure (if applicble) shall
meet the floodproofing criteria of this section and the NFIP regulations;
            6.   Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural
drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development, if
applicable;
            7.   At the community's discretion, the community may charge a fee
for issuance of floodplain development permits; and
            8.   Copies of all floodplain development permits and the
associated documents shall become property of the community and a permanent
record.
         (b)   Approval or denial of a development permit by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this section and the
following relevant factors:
            1.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            2.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            3.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
            4.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            5.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            6.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems;
            7.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
            8.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            9.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; and
            10.   The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive
Plan for that area.
      (5)   Use of elevation certificates. Lawrence County requires that the
following elevation certificates be completed for any new residential or non-
residential building construction:
         (a)   Proposed conditions. A proposed conditions elevation certificate
is required to be completed by a professional and licensed engineer, surveyor,
or architect as part of the floodplain permit package.
         (b)   Building under construction. A building under construction
elevation certificate is required to be completed by a professional and
licensed engineer, surveyor, or architect at _________________(timing
determined by community but suggested after foundation has been poured).
         (c)   Finished construction. A finished construction elevation
certificate is required to be completed by a professional and licensed
engineer, surveyor, or architect once the structure is completed, utilities are
installed, and grading and landscaping has been completed.
      (6)   Variance procedures. The County Commission acting as the Board of
Adjustment, as established by state law, as established by the community shall
hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of
this section after a floodplain permit has been denied.
         (a)   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Board of
Adjustment may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
         (b)   The Board of Adjustment, as established by the community, shall
hear and render judgement on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an
error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain
Administrator in the enforcement of administration of this section.
         (c)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all
actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and the State Office of Emergency Management upon issuing a
variance.
         (d)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size,
contiguous to and surrounded by lots, with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in this section have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         (e)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of
this section, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and
objectives of this section.
         (f)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         (g)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure. The term SUBSTANTIAL
IMPROVEMENT does not include any alteration of a structure or facility listed
on the National Register of Historical Places or a State Inventory of
Historical Places.
         (h)   Prerequisites for granting variances:
            1.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief; variances shall only be issued upon:
               a.   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
               b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
               c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances, considers
the need of ingress and egress during time of flood and does not jeopardize
first responders' health and welfare.
            2.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
            3.   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction
and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
            4.   The criteria outlined in this section are met; and
            5.   The structure or other development is protected by methods
that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional
threats to public safety.
      (7)   Watercourse alterations.
         (a)   No alteration to a channel, river, stream, drainage way, or
other watercourse shall diminish the flood-carrying capacity of that
watercourse. The altered or relocated watercourse shall have the same or
greater capacity as the original watercourse.
         (b)   All proposals for a watercourse alteration require submittal of
a floodplain development permit. The applicant shall submit a set of plans and
calculations prepared by a registered professional engineer of the proposed
alteration and its effect on flows. An applicant shall provide the following
information. Additional information may be submit and requested:
            1.   Topographic map of the project area;
            2.   A comparison of the existing and proposed channel capacity,
including engineering calculations prepared by a registered professional
engineer;
            3.   A description of the proposed alteration extent to which any
watercourse or natural drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of
proposed development;
            4.   Land use of adjacent properties;
            5.   Description of any obstructions;
            6.   Dimensions, specifications, and locations of any structures
(bridges, culverts, water crossing, dams, dikes, levees, detention basins,
etc.);
            7.    Photos of the area.
         (c)    Prior to approval of the floodplain development permit, the
applicant shall:
            1.    Submit an application and obtain a CLOMR from FEMA;
            2.   Notify adjacent communities, property owners and the and the
State Coordinating Agency, prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse and submit evidence of such notification to the Floodplain
Administrator and to FEMA;
            3.   Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of the watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not
diminished.
   (G)   Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
      (1)   General standards. In all areas of special flood hazards, the
following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial
improvements.
         (a)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
         (b)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
         (c)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
         (d)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
         (e)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
         (f)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge
from the systems into floodwaters.
         (g)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      (2)   Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where
base flood elevation data has been provided, the following provisions are
required.
         (a)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement), elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation. A registered
professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification
to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this section are
satisfied.
         (b)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one foot
above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level of the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this division (G)(2)(b). A record of such certification which includes the
specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator.
         (c)   Non-residential construction wet floodproofing.
            1.   New construction and substantial improvements of any
commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure including but not
limited to detached garages, agricultural buildings, and storage buildings may
be allowed to be wet floodproof provided that:
               a.   The structure is strictly a non-residential structure used
for building access, parking or storage only;
               b.   The structure is an accessory or appurtenant structure of
low value;
               c.   Designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood
waters through the use of openings;
               d.   Be constructed of flood resistant materials;
               e.   Be properly anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement;
               f.   Mechanical and utility equipment must be elevated or
floodproofed to or above the BFE;
               g.   Must comply with the floodway encroachment provisions of
the NFIP and this section;
               h.   Designed and built to adhere to FEMA Technical Bulletins 1,
2, and 7.
            2.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop
and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the
construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are
in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in division (G)
(2)(c). A record of such certification that includes the specific elevation (in
relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be
maintained by the Floodplain Administrator. If the use or occupancy of the
building changes in the future to residential, then the wet floodproofing of
the structure cannot be used when determining compliance of the structure to
the residential construction of this section. As such, the building will not be
grandfathered into compliance and will be required to be brought into
compliance with the residential construction of this section.
         (d)   Enclosures. 
            1.   New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are to be used solely for parking of
vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement and are
subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided;
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade; and
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
            2.   The development and construction of the structure must conform
with the provision in FEMA/Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)-Technical
Bulletins 1 and 2. Certification and documentation from a professional,
licensed engineer or architect is required if the structure's lowest floor is
built below the BFE.
         (e)   Crawlspace.
            1.   New construction and substantial improvements built on a
crawlspace or sub-grade (below grade) crawlspace may be permitted if the
development is designed and meets or exceeds the standards found in FEMA's
Technical Bulletins 1, 2, and 11, which include but are not limited to the
following.
            2.   The structure must be affixed to a permanent foundation,
designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy. Because of hydrodynamic loads, crawlspace
construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than five
feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design
professional, such as a registered architect or professional engineer.
               a.   The crawlspace is an enclosed area below the BFE and, as
such, must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. The bottom of each flood vent opening
can be no more than one foot above the LAG.
               b.   The crawlspace enclosure must have proper openings that
allow equalization of hydrostatic pressure by allowing automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters. To achieve this, a minimum of one square inch of flood opening
is required per one square foot of the enclosed area subject to flooding.
               c.   Portions of the building below the BFE must be constructed
with materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation
walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building, but also any joists,
insulation, piers, or other materials that extend below the BFE. Ductwork, in
particular, must either be placed above the BFE or sealed from floodwaters.
               d.   Any building utility systems within the crawlspace must be
elevated above the BFE or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or
accumulate within the system components during flood conditions.
               e.   The interior grade of a crawlspace below the BFE must not
be more than two feet below the LAG.
               f.   The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the
lowest interior grade of the crawlspace floor to the bottom of the floor joist
of the next higher floor cannot exceed four feet at any point.
               g.   There must be an adequate drainage system that removes
floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should
be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event.
               h.   Buildings with below-grade crawlspaces will have higher
flood insurance premiums than buildings that have the preferred crawlspace
construction, with the interior elevation at or above the LAG.
         (f)   Manufactured homes.
            1.   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A
on a community’s FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices
which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured
homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition
to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
            2.   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or
substantially improved within Zone AE on the community’s FIRM on sites: outside
of a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new manufactured home park or
subdivision; in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a
manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
            3.   All AE Zones require that manufactured homes to be placed or
substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park to be elevated so
that the lowest floor is at or above the base flood elevation; or the chassis
is supported by reinforced piers no less than 36 inches in height above grade
and securely anchored.
         (g)   Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed
on sites within Zone AE on the community’s FIRM either:
            1.   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days unless the
community has elected a higher standard option and be fully licensed and ready
for highway use;
               a.   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on
its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions;
or
            2.   Meet the permit requirements of division (F)(3) above, and the
elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes of this section. A
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking
system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and
security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
      (3)   Standards for subdivision proposals.
         (a)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with the
provisions of this section.
         (b)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided
to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
         (c)   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development
permit requirements of this section.
         (d)   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five
acres, whichever is less.
         (e)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
      (4)   Floodways. Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard
are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply:
         (a)   Designate a regulatory floodway which will not increase the base
flood level more than one foot;
         (b)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase greater than 0.00 feet,
unless higher standard option selected, in flood levels within the community
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge;
         (c)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall comply
with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division (G); and
         (d)   Under the provisions of 44 C.F.R. Chapter 1, § 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance regulations, a community may permit encroachments
within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base
flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional
FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.
      (5)   Certification. It is hereby found and declared by the county that
severe flooding has occurred in the past within its jurisdiction and will
certainly occur within the future; that flooding is likely to result in
infliction of serious personal injury or death, and is likely to result in
substantial injury or destruction of property within its jurisdiction; in order
to effectively comply with minimum standards for coverage under the National
Flood Insurance Program; and in order to effectively remedy the situation
described herein, it is necessary that this section become effective
immediately.

§ II-6.013 WSS - WHITEWOOD SUPERFUND SITE DISTRICT.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   The intent of the WSS - Whitewood Superfund Site District is to
minimize risk to individuals from arsenic at the site, with the assistance of
the county, Homestake Mining Company (HMC), Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), and the State Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).
      (2)   The information provided within this section and within the
Whitewood Creek Tailings Area Building Permit Handbook is offered as part of
the remediation requirements for the Whitewood Creek Superfund Site, which is
located in the county. This section is intended to remind site residents about
the EPA site remedy, and to identify precautions that should be taken by a site
resident to continue to protect their health and safety.
      (3)   This section provides county staff and landowners in the Whitewood
Creek Tailings area with guidance on how to proceed with residential
construction. It also details those activities prohibited or restricted by land
use ordinances applicable to the area.
      (4)   The Whitewood Superfund Site only applies to the area as described
in Figure 1, as shown below.
   (B)   Site remedy.
      (1)   Two soil types were identified by the EPA as potentially presenting
risks. Tailings deposits were tailings that were actively deposited in the old
stream bed and floodplain. Tailings impacted soil areas are soils that were
impacted by wind-blown tailings from the stream bed and floodplain.
      (2)   EPA chose a twofold remedy for the Whitewood Creek Superfund Site:
         (a)   Existing residential yards containing tailings deposits or
tailings impacted soils were cleaned up in 1991 and 1992 by removing these
materials or covering them with clean soil; and
         (b)   County ordinances were adopted to minimize exposure to tailings
deposits and tailings impacted soils in future development. In addition, an
existing state rule prohibiting shallow well construction in the Whitewood
Creek floodplain has been continued.
   (C)   Limitations and restrictions.
      (1)   Residential and commercial (non-agriculture) development on
tailings deposits is prohibited.
      (2)   Residential development is only allowed in tailings impacted soil
areas once the owner has remediated the soils, and only in areas that have soil
arsenic levels below 100 parts per million based on an appropriate sampling
program, as outlined on Page 3 of the Whitewood Creek Tailings Area Building
Permit Handbook - Building Restricted On Tailings Impacted Soils.
      (3)   Excavation of tailings materials and use of tailings materials
outside of the tailings deposits is prohibited. (Mining of the tailings is
allowed subject to the regulations of the individual county, the state, and
applicable federal requirements.)
      (4)   Importation of tailings deposits or tailings impacted soils to
residential yards is prohibited (e.g., these materials cannot be used for
driveways or as fill in yards or gardens).
      (5)   The construction of shallow wells within the tailings deposits is
prohibited by state law, ARSD 74:02:04:26.
      (6)   Please refer to the County Zoning Map in the County Planning and
Zoning Department for a general outline of the area. This map identifies
tailings deposits and tailings impacted soils.
   (D)   Site residents’ roles. Residents have an important role in
implementing the remedy and minimizing risk. Site residents are asked to do the
following:
      (1)   Notify Homestake Mining Company if floodwaters reach residential
yards within the site;
      (2)   Notify potential property owners about the Whitewood Creek
Superfund Site and provide them with this section. The assistance of site
residents is necessary to educate potential property owners, as warning signs
and deed restrictions were not included in the remedy in response to public
comment;
      (3)   Contact the County Planning and Zoning Department prior to any
construction on your property; and
      (4)   Notify Homestake Mining Company if you are aware of any planned
building activities within the Whitewood Creek Superfund Site.
   (E)   Site documents and contacts.
      (1)   Documents regarding the former Whitewood Creek Superfund Site,
including the record of decision and consent decree, are available for public
review at the County Register of Deed’s office, 90 Sherman Street, Deadwood, SD
57732. The phone number is (605) 578-3930.
      (2)   For detailed information on the requirements for construction in
the Whitewood Creek Superfund Site District, you will need to refer to the
Whitewood Creek Tailings Area Building Permit Handbook on file in the County
Planning and Zoning Department. This handbook is available in order to help
guide the landowner to meet all of the requirements of the WSS prior to the
county issuing a building permit. All of the information provided will be
reviewed by the County Planning Department, as well as Homestake Mining
Company. Be advised, the building permit process in this designated zoning
district will take longer than the designated five days as stated on building
permit applications.

   (E)   General standards for review.
      (1)   Structure. A WES must be of monopole construction to the extent
practicable. If monopole construction is not practicable, a wind tower must be
of freestanding construction to the extent practicable.
      (2)   Spacing and density. A WES must be separated from every other
system, to include those on adjacent properties by a sufficient distance so
that it does not interfere with another system.
      (3)   Clearance. The vertical distance from ground level to the tip of
the wind turbine blade when the blade is at its lowest point must be at least
25 feet.
      (4)   Access. All ground mounted electrical and control equipment shall
be labeled or secured to prevent unauthorized access, and the tower shall be
designed and installed so as not to provide step bolts or a ladder readily
accessible to the public for a minimum height of eight feet aboveground.
      (5)   Electrical wires. All electrical wires associated with a WES, other
than wires necessary to connect the wind turbine to its base and to overhead
collection lines, must be located underground.
      (6)   Code compliance. All WES must comply with all applicable state and
federal codes and regulations.
      (7)   Lighting. All WES may not be artificially lighted unless such
lighting is required by the Federal Aviation Administration. If lighting is
required, the lighting must comply with the FAA minimum requirements and,
whenever possible, be at the lowest intensity allowed, avoid the use of strobe
or other intermittent white lights, and use steady red lights. If more than one
lighting alternative is available, the alternative that causes the least visual
disturbance must be used.
      (8)   Appearance, color, and finish. The exterior surface of any visible
components of a WES must be a nonreflective or matte, white, grey, or another
neutral color. Wind towers and turbines that are located within one mile of
each other on a participating property must be of uniform design, including
tower type, color, number of blades, and direction of blade rotation.
      (9)   Signs. No wind turbine, tower, building, or other structure
associated with a WES may be used to advertise or promote any product or
service. No word or graphic representation, other than appropriate warning
signs and owner or landowner identification, may be placed on a wind turbine,
tower, building, or other structure associated with a WES so as to be visible
from any public road.
      (10)   Noise. WES facilities shall not exceed 50 dBA, as measured at any
point on the property adjacent to the parcel on which the WES is located.
      (11)   Flicker or shadow flicker. The effect that results when the shadow
cast by the rotating blade of a wind energy system moves across a fixed point.
The owner of a WES must take such reasonable steps as are necessary to prevent,
mitigate, and eliminate shadow flicker on any occupied structure on a
nonparticipating property.
      (12)   Federal Aviation Administration. All WES shall comply with FAA
standards and permits.
      (13)   Interference. The applicant shall minimize or mitigate
interference with electromagnetic communications, such as radio, telephone,
microwaves, or television signals caused by any WES. The applicant shall notify
all communication tower operators within two miles of the proposed WES location
upon application to the county for permits. No WES shall be constructed so as
to interfere with county or State Department of Transportation microwave
transmissions.
      (14)   Utility notification. No WES shall be installed until evidence has
been given that the utility company has been informed of the customer’s intent
to install an interconnected customer owned generator. Off-grid systems shall
be exempt from this requirement.
      (15)   Compatibility with permitted land uses. The applicant must
demonstrate that the proposed use is compatible with the permitted land uses in
a given zoning district and that the external effects of the use in relation to
the existing and planned uses of adjoining property and neighborhood can be
mitigated through imposition of standards and conditions.
   (F)   Small wind energy systems.
      (1)   Standards for review. Setbacks are as follows.
         (a)   SWES shall not be located closer than one and one-tenth times
the system height from all lot lines, public road rights-of-way, all utilities
easements or lines, and all private easements.
         (b)   All SWES shall be at least 300 feet from any public park.
      (2)   Abandonment of small wind energy systems.
         (a)   A small wind energy system that is out of service for a
continuous 12-month period will be deemed to have been abandoned and the
Administrator may issue a notice of abandonment to the owner. If, within 30
days of receipt of a notice of abandonment, the owner provides the
Administrator with written information showing that the system has not been
abandoned, the Administrator will withdraw the notice.
         (b)   An owner shall provide the Administrator with a written notice
of termination of operations if the operation of a wind energy system is
terminated. Such notice shall be provided within 30 days of system operation
termination.
         (c)   1.   A small wind energy system must be removed within three
months of the mailing date of the notice of abandonment unless the
Administrator withdraws the notice, or within six months of providing notice of
termination of operations. The notice of abandonment shall be mailed by
certified mail to the address of the property owner as listed by Director of
Equalization records. The owner shall remove all:
               a.   Wind turbines, aboveground improvements, and outdoor
storage;
               b.   Foundations, pads, and underground electrical wires and
reclaim the site to a depth of four feet below the surface of the ground; and
               c.   Hazardous material from the property and dispose of the
hazardous material in accordance with federal and state law.
            2.   If the owner fails to remove a small wind energy system and
reclaim the site, the county may remove or cause the removal of the system and
the reclamation of the site.
   (G)   Large wind energy systems.
      (1)   Standards for review.
         (a)   Setbacks.
            1.   A LWES shall not be closer than 1,000 feet or one and one-
tenth times the system height, whichever is greater, from any occupied off-site
residence, business, and public building. For the purposes of this section
only, the term business does not include agricultural uses.
            2.   LWES shall not be located closer than 500 feet or one and one-
tenth times the system height, whichever is greater, from all lot lines, public
road rights-of-way, all utilities easements or lines, and all private

         (b)   Footprint minimization. The permittee shall design and construct
the LWES so as to minimize the amount of land that is impacted by the LWES.
Associated facilities in the vicinity of turbines such as electrical/electronic
boxes, transformers, and monitoring systems shall, to the extent practicable,
be mounted on the foundations used for turbine towers or inside the towers
unless otherwise allowed by the landowner on whose property the LWES is
constructed.
         (c)   Site clearance. The permittee shall disturb or clear the site
only to the extent necessary to assure suitable access for construction, safe
operation, and maintenance of the LWES.
         (d)   Topsoil protection. The permittee shall implement measures to
protect and segregate topsoil from subsoil in cultivated lands unless otherwise
negotiated with the affected landowner.
         (e)   Compaction. The permittee shall implement measures to minimize
compaction of all lands during all phases of the projects life and shall
confine compaction to as small an area as practicable.
         (f)   Livestock protection. The permittee shall take precautions to
protect livestock on the LWES site from project operations during all phases of
the project’s life.
         (g)   Fences. The permittee shall promptly replace or repair all
fences and gates removed or damaged by project operations during all phases of

         (h)   Public roads.
            1.   Prior to commencement of construction, the permittee shall
identify all state, county, or township haul roads that will be used for the
LWES project and shall notify the state, county, or township governing body
having jurisdiction over the roads to determine if the haul roads identified
are acceptable. The governmental body shall be given adequate time to inspect
the haul roads prior to use of these haul roads. Where practicable, existing
roadways shall be used for all activities associated with the LWES. Where
practicable, all weather roads shall be used to deliver concrete, turbines,
towers, assemble nacelles, and all other heavy components to and from the
turbine sites.
            2.   The permittee shall, prior to the use of approved haul roads,
make satisfactory arrangements with the appropriate state, county, or township
governmental body having jurisdiction over approved haul roads for construction
of the LWES for the maintenance and repair of the haul roads that will be
subject to extra wear and tear due to transportation of equipment and LWES
components. The permittee shall notify the Planning and Zoning Department of
such arrangements.
         (i)   Turbine access roads. Construction of turbine access roads shall
be minimized and shall be approved by the County Highway Department.
         (j)   Private roads. The permittee shall promptly repair private roads
or lanes damaged when moving equipment or when obtaining access to the site,

measures and practices of construction to control dust during construction.
         (l)   Soil erosion and sediment control plan. The permittees shall
develop a soil erosion and sediment control plan prior to construction and
submit the plan to the County Zoning Office. The soil erosion and sediment
control plan shall address the erosion control measures for each project phase,
and shall at a minimum identify: plans for grading, construction, and drainage
of roads and turbine pads; necessary soil information; detailed design features
to maintain downstream water quality; a comprehensive revegetation plan that
uses native plant species to maintain and ensure adequate erosion control and
slope stability and to restore the site after temporary project activities; and
measures to minimize the area of surface disturbance. Other practices shall
include containing excavated material, protecting exposed soil, stabilizing
restored material, and removal of silt fences or barriers when the area is
stabilized. The plan shall identify methods for disposal or storage of
excavated material.
         (m)   Feeder lines. The permittee shall place overhead electric lines,
known as feeders, on public rights-of-way if a public right-of-way exists or
immediately adjacent to the public right-of-way on private property. Changes in
routes may be made as long as feeders remain on public rights-of-way or
immediately adjacent to the public right-of-way on private property and
approval has been obtained from the governmental unit responsible for the
affected right-of-way. If no public right-of-way exists, the permittee may
place feeders on private property. When placing feeders on private property,
the permittee shall place the feeder in accordance with the easement(s)
negotiated. The permittee shall submit the site plan and engineering drawings
for the feeder lines to the Board before commencing construction.
         (n)   Site plan information. Site plan information that may be

            7.   Mitigation measures; and
            8.   Status of interconnection studies/agreements.
      (2)   Decommissioning of large wind energy systems.
         (a)   Cost responsibility. The owner or operator of a LWES is
responsible for decommissioning that facility and for all costs associated with
decommissioning that facility and associated facilities. The decommissioning
plan shall clearly identify the responsible party.
         (b)   Useful life. A LWES is presumed to be at the end of its useful
life if the facility generates no electricity for a continuous period of 12
months. The presumption may be rebutted by submitting to the County Commission
for approval of a plan outlining the steps and schedule for returning the LWES
to service within 12 months of the submission.
         (c)   Decommissioning period. The facility owner or operator shall
begin decommissioning a LWES facility within eight months after the time the
facility or turbine reaches the end of its useful life, as determined in
division (G)(2)(b) above. Decommissioning must be completed within 18 months
after the facility or turbine reaches the end of its useful life.
         (d)   Decommissioning requirements. Decommissioning and site
restoration includes: dismantling and removal of all towers, turbine
generators, transformers, overhead and underground cables, foundations,
buildings, and ancillary equipment to a depth of 42 inches; and removal of
surface road material and restoration of the roads and turbine sites to
substantially the same physical condition that existed immediately before
construction of the LWES. To the extent possible, the site must be restored and
reclaimed to the topography and topsoil quality that existed just prior to the
beginning of the construction of the commercial wind energy conversion facility
or wind turbine. Disturbed earth must be graded and reseeded, unless the
landowner requests in writing that the access roads or other land surface areas
be retained.
         (e)   Decommissioning plan. Prior to a building permit being issued of
a LWES facility, the facility owner or operator shall file with the County
Commission the estimated decommissioning cost per turbine, in current dollars
at the time of the application, for the proposed facility and a decommissioning
plan that describes how the facility owner will ensure that resources are
available to pay for decommissioning the facility at the appropriate time. The
County Commission shall review a plan filed under this section and shall
approve or disapprove the plan within six months after the decommissioning plan
was filed. The County Commission may, at any time, require the owner or
operator of a LWES to file a report describing how the LWES owner or operator
is fulfilling this obligation.
         (f)   Financial assurance. The County Commission shall require a
performance bond, surety bond, letter of credit, corporate guarantee, or other
form of financial assurance that is acceptable to the County Commission to
cover the anticipated costs of decommissioning the LWES.

§ II-10.005 ADULT ORIENTED BUSINESSES.
   (A)   General. In the development and execution of these regulations, it is
recognized that there are some uses which, because of their very nature, are
recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics,
particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances
thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. Special regulation
of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not
contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood.
These special regulations are itemized in this section. The primary control or
regulation is for the purpose of preventing a concentration of these uses in
any one area.
   (B)   Setbacks.
      (1)   None of the following permitted uses may be established, operated,
or maintained within 1,000 feet of a residential dwelling, a residential
district, a church, a school meeting all the requirements of the Compulsory
Education Laws of the state, or a public park, as measured from the closest
point of the property lines:
         (a)   Adult bookstore;
         (b)   Adult theater;
         (c)   Adult photo studio;
         (d)   Adult cabaret;
         (e)   Adult motel;
         (f)   Nude model studio;
         (g)   Adult video store;
         (h)   Adult novelty store;
         (i)   Escort agencies;
         (j)   Any use which has as a part of its operation adult entertainment

bar, lounge, or tavern; and
         (k)   Any use intended to provide adult amusement or entertainment.
      (2)   No more than one adult use may be established, operated, or
maintained within 2,500 feet of another adult use as measured from the closest
point of the outside wall of the building or tenant space.
      (3)   The 1,000-foot restriction provided for in division (B)(1) above
may be waived and a conditional use permit issued upon proper application if
the county finds that:
         (a)   The proposed use will not be contrary to the public interest or
injurious to nearby properties and that the spirit and intent of these
regulations will be observed;
         (b)   The proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the development
of a skid row area; and
         (c)   All applicable regulations will be observed.
(Ord. 14-01, passed 6-6-2014, Ch. 10, Art. 5)
§ II-10.006 CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATION.
   (A)   Intent.
      (1)   Adoption of this section is intended to comply with the County
Comprehensive Plan, adopted in 1998 and as amended in 2005, wherein it was
recommended that the county create regulations to protect potentially
conflicting and neighboring land uses from undesirable impacts related to
larger scale animal containment and feedlot operations while at the same time
balancing the interests of agricultural producers by providing a mechanism by
which agricultural uses are preserved and allows for reasonable expansion in
such operations.
      (2)   It is not the intent of the county to regulate a typical farm/ranch
operation. A typical FARM/RANCH OPERATION, as defined herein, is a cow/calf or
yearling operation based on grazing of rangeland or tame grass pastures with
supplemental feeding needed for five to seven months out of every year. This
operation may require confinement of livestock in non-vegetated lots/open lots
for calving and weaning operations for more than 45 days.
      (3)   An adequate supply of healthy livestock, poultry, and other animals
is essential to the well-being of county citizens and the state. However,
livestock, poultry, and other animals produce manure, which may, where
improperly stored, transported, or disposed, negatively affect the county’s
environment. Animal manure must be controlled where it may add to air, surface
water, groundwater, or land pollution. The following regulations have been
adopted to provide protection against pollution caused by manure from
domesticated animals. All new and proposed expansions of concentrated feeding
operations shall comply with the regulations as outlined herein.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      ANIMAL MANURE. Poultry, livestock, or other animal excreta or mixture of
excreta with feed, bedding, or other materials.
      ANIMAL UNIT. Number of animals necessary to obtain a weight of 1,000
pounds constitutes one ANIMAL UNIT.
      APPLICANT. An individual, a corporation, a group of individuals,
partnership, joint venture, owners, or any other business entity having charge
or control of one or more concentrated animal feeding operations.
      AQUIFER. A geologic formation, group of formations, or part of a
formation capable of storing and yielding groundwater to wells or springs.
      BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMP). Schedules of activities, prohibitions of
practice, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or
reduce the pollution of waters of the state. BMPs also include treatment
requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control site runoff,
spillage or leaks, sludge, manure disposal, manure application, waste or manure
stockpiles, or drainage from raw material storage.
      BYPASS. The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a
treatment facility.
      COMMON OWNERSHIP. Single, corporate, cooperative, or other joint
operation or venture.
      CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATION (CAFO). A lot, yard, corral,
building, or other area where animals have been, are, or will be stabled or
confined for a total of 45 days or more during any 12-month period, and where
crops, vegetation, forage growth, or post harvest residues are not sustained
over a portion of the lot or facility. Two or more animal feeding operations
under common ownership are single animal operations if they adjoin each other,
or if they use a common area, or if they use a common area or system for
disposal of manure. A typical farm/ranch operation does not constitute a CAFO,
see definition of a “typical farm/ranch operation”.
      DOMESTIC ANIMAL. Any animal that, through long association with humans,
has been bred to a degree which has resulted in genetic changes affecting the
temperament, color, conformation, or other attributes of the species to an
extent that makes it unique and different from wild individuals of its kind.
For the purpose of this section, the definition shall include, but is not
limited to, animals commonly raised on farms and ranches such as cattle,
horses, hogs, sheep, and mules.
      EARTHEN MANURE STORAGE BASIN. An earthen cavity, either covered or
uncovered, which, on a regular basis, receives waste discharges from a
confinement feeding operation if accumulated wastes from the basin are removed
at least once each year.
      FEEDLOT OPERATOR. An individual, a corporation, a group of individuals,
partnership, joint venture, owners, or any other business entity having charge
or control of one or more concentrated animal feeding operations.
      FORMED MANURE STORAGE STRUCTURE. A structure, either covered or
uncovered, used to store manure from a confinement feeding operation, which has
walls and a floor constructed of concrete, concrete block, wood, steel, or
similar materials.
      HOUSED LOT. Totally roofed buildings that may be open or completely
enclosed on the sides. Animals are housed over solid concrete or dirt floors,
slotted floors over pits or manure collection areas in pens, stalls, or cages.
HOUSED LOT is synonymous with other industry terms such as slotted floor
buildings.
      HUMAN-MADE. A pipeline, ditch, drain, tile, terrace, irrigation system,
machine, or other object that carries manure, wastewater, or runoff into waters
of the state.
      LETTER OF ASSURANCE. A list of conditions signed by the applicant for a
permit acknowledging agreement to follow the conditions of the permit.
      MANURE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. Any piping, containment structures, and
disposal appurtenances associated with the collection, storage, treatment, and
disposal of manure or wastewater at a concentrated animal feeding operation.
      NON-FARM DWELLING. Any occupied dwelling, which is not a farm dwelling.
      NO-TILL CROPLAND. Land which is subject to a conservation farming
practice: where the soil is left undisturbed from harvest to planting; where
planting or drilling is done in a narrow seedbed or slot created by coulters,
row cleaners, disk openers, or in-row chisel; and where this conservation
practice has been ongoing for at least four consecutive years to establish the
soil characteristics necessary to reduce or eliminate erosion from runoff.
      OPEN LOT. Pens or similar confinement areas with dirt, or concrete (or
paved or hard) surfaces. Animals are exposed to the outside environment except
for possible small portions affording some protection by windbreaks or small
shed type shade areas. OPEN LOT is synonymous with other industry terms such as
pasture lot, dirt lot, or dry lot.
      PROCESS GENERATED WASTEWATER. Water directly or indirectly used in the
operation of an animal feeding operation. The term includes: spillage or
overflow from watering systems; water and manure collected while washing,
cleaning, or flushing pens, barns, manure pits, or other areas; water and
manure collected during direct contact swimming, washing, or spray cooling of
animals; and water used in dust control.
      PROCESS WASTEWATER. Any process generated wastewater and any
precipitation (rain or snow) that comes into contact with the animals, manure,
litter, or bedding, feed, or other portions of the animal feeding operation.
The term includes runoff from an open lot.
      PRODUCER. The owner or operator of the concentrated livestock feeding
operation.
      SEDIMENT BASIN. A basin constructed to trap and store waterborne sediment
and debris.
      SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR OF POLLUTION. To determine if a feedlot meets
this definition, the following factors are considered:
         (a)   Size of feeding operation and amount of manure reaching waters
of the state;
         (b)   Location of the feeding operation in relation to waters of the
state;
         (c)   Means of conveyance of manure and process wastewater into waters
of the state; and
         (d)   The slope, vegetation, rainfall, and other factors affecting the
likelihood or frequency of discharge of animal manure and process wastewater
into waters of the state.
      TYPICAL FARM/RANCH OPERATION. Involves a cow/calf or yearling operation
or equivalent based on grazing of rangeland or tame grass pastures with
supplemental feeding needed for five to seven months out of every year. This
operation may require confinement of livestock in non-vegetated lots/open lots
for calving and weaning operations for more than 45 days.
      UNAUTHORIZED RELEASES. The discharge of water from the lower end of the
treatment or containment system through a release structure or over or through
retention dikes. An UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE is distinguished from a bypass in that
a bypass discharges wastewater prior to any treatment or containment.
      WATERS OF THE STATE. All waters within the jurisdiction of this state,
including all streams, lakes, ponds, impounding reservoirs, marshes,
watercourses, waterways, wells, springs, irrigation systems, drainage systems,
and all other bodies or accumulations of water, surface and underground,
natural or artificial, public or private, situated wholly or partly within or
bordering upon the state.
   (C)   Concentrated feeding operation conditional use permit requirements.
Any person who owns, operates, or proposes to operate a CAFO, as defined within
these regulations, shall be required to obtain a conditional use permit (CUP)
whenever any of the following occur:
      (1)   When a new CAFO is proposed where one does not exist;
      (2)   When an expansion is proposed beyond what a current CUP is
permitted for;
      (3)   When an existing CAFO is to be restocked after being idle for five
or more years; and
      (4)   When a change in ownership or transfer of control.
   (D)   Animal units and number of animals to define types of permits. Animal
feeding operations listed in the table below shall need a conditional use
permit.

property, including public rights-of-way.
   (B)   Permit required. No person shall operate a temporary use without first
obtaining a permit from the County Planning Department or County Commission as
prescribed in this section. The County Planning Department may determine that a

temporary use permit shall be referred to the County Commission for a public
hearing.

manner consistent with the requirements of this section.
   (D)   Fees. Upon the filing of any application for a temporary use permit,

cleaned up and returned to its pre-event condition. Permittee will be billed
for the actual labor, materials, and other costs associated and/or incurred by
the county to return the property to its pre-event condition in the event the
county, at its sole discretion, deems it necessary to do so. Permittee and
landowner (if different), upon approval of the permit, expressly grant to the
county a right-of-entry to access the property for purposes of inspection and
cleanup thereby returning the property to its pre-event condition and further
agree that any costs and/or expenses incurred by the county in excess of the

expanded or changed unless to a conforming use, except as permitted by the
County Commission in accordance with the provisions of this title.
      (2)   Any nonconforming structure damaged by fire, flood, explosion, or
other casualty may be reconstructed and used as before if such reconstruction
is performed within 12 months of such casualty, and if the restored structure
covers no greater area and contains no greater cubic content than before such
casualty. If damaged to the extent that the existing structure is a total loss,
then any new structure and its use shall conform to all requirements of this
title.
      (3)   In the event that any nonconforming use, conducted in a structure
or otherwise, ceases, for whatever reason, for a period of one year, such
nonconforming use shall not be resumed, and any future use shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this title.
      (4)   The nonconforming use of a building may be extended throughout
those parts hereof, which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at
the time of adoption of the title. A nonconforming building or structure may,
with the approval of the Planning Board and County Commission, be extended or
enlarged a maximum of 25% of the gross floor area of the existing structure,
but must meet minimum yard requirements of the district in which the structure
is located.
      (5)   If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a
building may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or more
restricted classification.
      (6)   Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the overall
layout, plans, construction, size, or designated use of any development,
building, structure, or part thereof, for which official approval and required
permits have been granted, or where no approvals or permits are necessary,
where construction has been legally started before the enactment of this title,
and completed within a one-year period.
      (7)   Any structure or portion thereof declared unsafe by a proper
authority shall be restored to a safe condition, or removed.
      (8)   Once changed to a conforming use, no structure or land shall be
permitted to revert to a nonconforming use.
      (9)   Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed, so as to
transfer an area from one district to another district of a different
classification, this section shall also apply to any uses which thereby become
nonconforming.

§ II-15.004 VARIANCES.
   The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall not vary the regulations unless it
shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific
case and shall use the following considerations to do so:
   (A)   The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved would result in a particular
hardship upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the
strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out.
   (B)   The conditions upon which the application for a variance is based
would not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoning
classification or other property substantially similar in use.
   (C)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the area in which the
property is located.
   (D)   The proposed variance will not unreasonably impair an adequate supply
of light and air to adjacent property; increase the congestion in the public
streets; increase the danger of fire; endanger the public safety; or diminish
or impair property values within the area.
   (E)   That because of circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility
that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of
the zoning regulations and that the authorization of a variance is therefore
necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
   (F)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford reasonable relief and will represent the least modification
desirable of the zoning regulations.
   (G)   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and make determinations on variance
to exceed the height limits as established by these regulations.
   (H)   The Board of Adjustment, under its authority to grant variances may
impose reasonable conditions on the grant, and one accepting those conditions
is bound by them.

EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRY CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
§ II-20.001 GENERAL.
   (A)   This subchapter is to inform the public of the significant potential
for the development of extractive industry within the county and to minimize
the adverse effects of extractive industry development on public and private
land uses within the county. The county recognizes that the orderly development
of extractive industry is essential to the economic well-being of its residents
and to the needs of society. The county likewise recognizes that conflicts may
arise when extraction occurs in proximity to less intensive land uses. This
subchapter will serve to inform the public that lands in the county may be
subject to extractive industry development by surface and/or underground means.
This subchapter also informs developers of additional requirements for securing
a conditional use permit for extractive industry development in the county.
   (B)   The County Commission hereby finds and declares that:
      (1)   Extractive industry is essential to the economic well-being of the
county and to the needs of society, and that reclamation of affected lands is
necessary to prevent or minimize adverse effects to the environment, provide
for future beneficial land use, and to protect the public health and safety;
      (2)   Extractive industry and associated activities and facilities may be
allowed in zoning districts as described in
Chapter 6 of this zoning title, subject to the provisions and regulations set
forth in this subchapter and special requirements and conditions may be
required and included in the permit, when deemed necessary, for the protection
of public and private interests;
      (3)   Each new large-scale extractive industry development shall be
required to prepare a socioeconomic impact study, at the operator’s expense, to
identify actual and potential impacts to units of local government and adjacent
land uses arising from the development of lands within the county;
      (4)   Each new small-scale extractive industry development may be
required to prepare a socioeconomic impact study, at the operator’s expense, to
identify actual and potential impacts to units of local government and adjacent
land uses arising from the development of lands within the county;
      (5)   Land use conflicts that may result from development of lands by
extractive industry shall be minimized by the provision for adequate buffer
zones, mutually beneficial to all concerned;
      (6)   Off-site mitigation may be required when the county deems the
proposed reclamation of land disturbed by an extractive industry to be
undesirable or insufficient for practical future beneficial use;
      (7)   Reclamation of lands within the county for future beneficial use is
a matter of local concern and jurisdiction, for the protection of the public
interest, health, and safety;
      (8)   Extractive industry development may occur in areas of diverse
geologic, topographic, biological, and social character, and reclamation of
disturbed lands may vary from site to site; and
      (9)   An appropriate buffer zone, extending outward from the area of
disturbance, shall be established at the discretion of the County Commission
upon evaluation of the considerations found in §
II-20.008. The standard buffer zone shall be no less than 500 feet from the
area of disturbance, subject to the application of the provisions of §§
II-20.030 through
20.035 in such case the buffer zone may be less than 500 feet.

   (A)   The provisions of these regulations shall apply to all lands proposed
to be developed by large and small-scale extractive industry, as herein
defined, within the jurisdiction of the county.
   (B)   This chapter shall supersede the provisions of
Chapter 19 of this zoning title for extractive industry only.
