metered and billed for connection to the city water and sewer system. If a

service, reinstatement of service at any time to the same service location will
require payment of the appropriate water and sewer tap rates plus metered and
billed services from and after the date of payment of the tap rate. Tap rates

estate connected to the city water and sewer system is responsible for payment
of all water and sewer service rates, charges, and surcharges upon read out and
final billing to a tenant who is vacating such property. The owner will remain
responsible for such water and sewer service rates, charges, and surcharges
until such time as a new tenant applies for service at such property and pays
the required deposit in full. Upon read out and final billing on rental
property which is actually known to the Municipal Finance Officer to be rental
property, the Finance Officer will, within a reasonable time not to exceed ten
business days notify the owner of such property that read out and final billing
to the tenant has occurred and that the owner is responsible for payment for
continued water and sewer service to the property. Such notice may be by
telephone, email, or by first class mail as determined by the Finance Officer.
It is the duty and obligation of the owner of such property to properly notify
the city and authorize a complete disconnection if the owner does not wish to
remain responsible for continued water and sewer service rates, charges, and
surcharges to the property.

accessing the city electric grid whether any energy is used or not. The
facility charge continues so long as a meter is installed at any location.
      (2)   Energy charge. The energy is what the city charges a customer for
electricity usage based on the energy consumed in terms of kilowatt-hours (kWh)

an energy cost adjustment to compensate the city for variations in the cost of

used to arrive at the adjustment will be developed, and the adjustment will be
applied to all kWh billed by the city to its electric customers.
      (4)   Prompt payment provisions. All charges are net. If the bill is not
paid or mailed and postmarked by the 20th day of the month following the
billing date, a late payment charge of 10% of the balance due will apply. If
the 20th of the month falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a holiday the due date
will be the next working day by 10:00 a.m.

in compliance with the provisions of the laws of the state.

used or not. Upon either removal of the meter or transfer of the service at the
customer’s specific location to another customer, and payment by the transferor
customer of all outstanding energy charges and payment by the transferee
customer of an appropriate connection fee, the original customer’s connection
fee will be refunded to the original customer, without interest.

PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINING EQUITABLE SEWER SERVICE CHARGES
§ 51.20 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter shall be to generate sufficient revenue to
pay all costs for the operation and maintenance of the complete wastewater
system. The costs shall be distributed to all users of the system in proportion
to each user’s contribution to the total loading of the treatment works.
Factors such as strength (BOD and TSS), volume and delivery flow rate
characteristics shall be considered and included as the basis for the user’s
contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of operation and maintenance
costs to each user (or user class).
(Ord. 209, passed - -)
§ 51.21 DETERMINING THE TOTAL ANNUAL COST OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   The city, or its Utility Manager, shall determine the total costs of
operation and maintenance of the wastewater system which are necessary to
maintain the capacity and performance, during the service life of the treatment
works, for which such works were designed and constructed. The total annual
cost of operation and maintenance shall include, but need not be limited to,
labor, repairs, equipment replacement, maintenance, necessary modifications,
power, sampling, laboratory tests and a reasonable contingency fund.
(Ord. 209, passed - -)
§ 51.22 DETERMINING EACH USER’S WASTEWATER CONTRIBUTION PERCENTAGE.
   (A)   The city, or its Utility Manager, shall determine for each user or
user class the average daily volume of wastewater discharged to the wastewater
system, which shall then be divided by the average daily volume of all
wastewater discharged to the wastewater system to determine such user’s volume
contribution percentage. The amount used as the total average daily volume of
wastewater shall exclude infiltration and inflow. The city, or its Utility
Manager, shall determine for each user or user class the average daily poundage
of five-day 20°C biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) discharged to the wastewater
system which shall then be divided by the average daily poundage of all five-
day BOD discharged to the wastewater system to determine such user’s BOD
contribution percentage.
   (B)   The city, or its Utility Manager, shall determine for each user or
user class the average daily total suspended solids (TSS) poundage discharged
to the wastewater system, which shall then be divided by the average daily
poundage of all TSS discharged to the wastewater system, to determine such
user’s TSS contribution percentage. The volume contribution percentage, BOD
contribution percentage and TSS contribution percentage for each user or user
class shall be multiplied by the annual operation and maintenance costs for
wastewater treatment of the total volume flow, total five-day 20°C BOD and
total TSS, respectively.
(Ord. 209, passed - -)
§ 51.23 DETERMINING A SURCHARGE SYSTEM FOR USERS AND EXCESS BOD AND TSS.
   The city, or its Utility Manager, will assess a surcharge rate for all
nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD and TSS strengths greater than
the average residential user. Such users will be assessed a surcharge
sufficient to cover the cost of treating their above-normal strength wastes.
Normal strength wastes are considered to be 200 ppm BOD and 250 ppm TSS. The
surcharge rate structure for such above-normal waste dischargers is attached.
(See
Appendix A.)
(Ord. 209, passed - -)
§ 51.24 DETERMINING EACH USER’S SERVICE CHARGE.
   Each nonresidential user’s wastewater treatment cost contributions as
determined in §§
51.22 and
51.23 shall be added together to determine such user’s annual wastewater
service charge. Residential users may be considered to be one class of user and
an equitable service charge may be determined for each user based on an
estimate of the total wastewater contribution of this class of user. The
governing body may classify industrial, commercial and other nonresidential
establishments as residential user, provided that the wastes from these
establishments are equivalent to the wastes from the average residential user
with respect to volume, total suspended solids and BOD. Each user’s wastewater
treatment cost contribution will be assessed in accordance with the attached
rate schedule. (See
Appendix B.)
(Ord. 209, passed - -)
§ 51.25 WASTEWATER FACILITIES REPLACEMENT FUND.
   A reserve fund called the Wastewater Facilities Replacement Fund is hereby

and pedestrians as follows.
   (A)   Green alone or “go”.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight through or
turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the
right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within

traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or “Stop”
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles.

crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before

right side of the roadway, then at the entrance to the intersection in
obedience to a red or “Stop” signal, may make a right turn but shall yield the
right- of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by signal
at said intersection. Such Council action permitting a right turn after a stop
when facing a steady red light alone shall be effective when a sign is erected
at such intersection giving notice thereof.

      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
or she can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
      (3)   In the event of official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

traffic sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as
follows.

nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.

flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past such

STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
§ 153.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION AND ADOPTION OF CHAPTER [SDCL CH. 9-36].
   The city elects to comply with the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as amended). The National Flood Insurance
Program, established in the aforesaid Act, provides that areas of the county
having a special flood hazard be identified by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and that floodplain management measures be applied in such flood hazard
areas. The National Flood Insurance Program was broadened and modified with the
passage of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 and other legislative
measures. It was further modified by the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of
1994. The National Flood Insurance Program is administered by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security.
(Ord. passed 5-1-1989; Ord. 2022-4, passed 3-21-2022)
§ 153.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)    The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Ord. passed 5-1-1989; Ord. 2022-4, passed 3-21-2022)
§ 153.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(Ord. passed 5-1-1989; Ord. 2022-4, passed 3-21-2022)
§ 153.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. passed 5-1-1989; Ord. 2022-4, passed 3-21-2022)

issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE.
      (1)   For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building,
including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally aboveground, as
well as a manufactured home.
      (2)   STRUCTURE, for insurance purposes, means:
         (a)   A building with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully
secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site;
         (b)   A manufactured home (also known as a mobile home, is a
structure: built on a permanent chassis, transported to its site in one or more
sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation); or
         (c)   A travel trailer without wheels built on a chassis and affixed
to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community’s floodplain
management and building ordinances or laws.
      (3)   For the latter purpose, STRUCTURE does not mean a recreational
vehicle or a park trailer or other similar vehicle, except as described in
division (2)(c) of this definition, or a gas or liquid storage tank.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in CFR sections 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4),
(c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in VIOLATION until
such time as that documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas.

§ 153.54 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   The Appeal Board shall hear and render judgement on requests for variances
from the requirements of this chapter.
   (A)   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board
may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
   (B)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and the State Office of Emergency Management upon issuing a
variance.
   (C)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in this section have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
   (D)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter.
   (E)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (G)   Prerequisites for granting variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (E)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (F)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that:
      (1)   The criteria outlined in divisions (A) through (G) are met; and
      (2)   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.
   (G)   A CLOMR is required only for those projects that will:
      (1)   BFE/no floodway (demonstrate less than one-foot increase).
         (a)   A project on a stream or river that has been studied through
detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses and for which base flood elevations
(BFEs) have been specified, but a floodway has not been designated. If the
developer/property owner/community proposes to allow development that would
result in more than a one-foot increase in the BFE, a CLOMR must first be
obtained.
         (b)   44 CFR 60.3(c)(10). Result in an increase in the base flood
water surface elevation (WSEL) of greater than one-foot for streams with BFEs
specified but no regulatory floodway designated.
      (2)   BFE/floodway (no rise).
         (a)   The second situation requiring a CLOMR is for a project on a
stream or river for which detailed analyses have been conducted and BFEs and a
floodway have been designated. If the community proposes to allow development
totally or partially within the floodway that would result in any (greater than
zero foot) increase in the BFE, a CLOMR must be obtained.
         (b)   44 CFR 60.3(d)(3). Result in any base flood WSEL increase from
proposed construction within a regulatory floodway.

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 153.65 GENERAL STANDARDS.
    In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required
for all new construction and substantial improvements:
   (A)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
   (B)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
   (C)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials resistant to flood damage;
   (D)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding;
   (E)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
   (F)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge
from the systems into floodwaters; and
   (G)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding.
(Ord. passed 5-1-1989; Ord. 2022-4, passed 3-21-2022)
§ 153.66 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has
been provided the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement),
elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation. A registered professional
engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the
floodplain administrator that the standards of this chapter are satisfied.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one foot
above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this subchapter. A record of such certification which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which
are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
      (1)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than
one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
      (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
      (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
   (D)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a
community’s FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which
minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes
must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over
the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
      (2)   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s FIRM on sites: 1)
outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, 2) in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, 3) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision, or 4) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a result of a
flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      (3)   In A1-30, AH, and AE Zones, require that manufactured homes to be
placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park to be
elevated so that the lowest floor is at or above the base flood elevation; or
the chassis is supported by reinforced piers no less than 36 inches in height
above grade and securely anchored.
   (E)   Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s FIRM either:
      (1)   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
      (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
      (3)   Meet the permit requirements of §
153.53 and the elevation and anchoring requirements for “manufactured homes” of
this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.

§ 153.67 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development
permit requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever
is lesser.
   (D)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazards.
   (E)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage.
(Ord. 2022-4, passed 3-21-2022)
§ 153.68 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES).
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in this
chapter, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special
flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions
apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community’s FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community’s FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed
so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
   (C)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in §
153.53 of this chapter, are satisfied.
(Ord. 2022-4, passed 3-21-2022)
§ 153.69 ADEQUATE DRAINAGE PATHS.
   Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on
slops, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
(Ord. 2022-4, passed 3-21-22)
§ 153.70 FLOODWAYS.
   Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in this
chapter are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters which
carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply:
   (A)   Designate a regulatory floodway which will not increase the base flood
level more than one foot.
   (B)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (C)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, section 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments
within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base
flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional
FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.
(Ord. 2022-4, passed 3-21-2022)
§ 153.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   In accordance with section 59.2(b) of CFR 44, Chapter 1, of the
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) Regulations, to qualify for the sale of
federally subsidized flood insurance, a community must adopt floodplain
management regulations that meets or exceeds the minimum standards of section
60. “These regulations must include effective enforcement provisions.” In
accordance with section 60.1(b) of CFR 44, Chapter 1, of the NFIP regulations,
“These regulations must be legally enforceable, applied uniformly throughout
the community to all privately and publicly owned land within flood prone
(i.e., mudflow) or flood related erosion areas, and the community must provide
that the regulations take precedence over less restrictive conflicting local
laws, ordinances or codes.”
   (B)   Therefore, no structure or land shall hereafter be constructed,
located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms
of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
   (C)   Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with
any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any
person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not to exceed the current
maximum penalty for conviction of a Class 2 misdemeanor from time to time in
effect under South Dakota Code or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or
both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses
involved in the case.
   (D)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
