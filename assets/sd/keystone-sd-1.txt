§ 37.01 POLICY PURPOSE.
   The Keystone Town Board adopts this Code of Ethics and Conduct to assure
that each elected and appointed official conducts himself or herself in a
manner that will instill public confidence and trust in the fair operation and
integrity of Keystone’s government.
(Ord. passed 3-6-2024)
§ 37.02 ETHICS.
   The citizens and businesses of Keystone are entitled to have fair, ethical,
and accountable local government. Therefore, members of the Town Board and of
all boards and committees shall conduct themselves in accordance with the
following ethical standards:
   (A)   Act in the public interest. Recognizing that stewardship of the public
interest must be their primary concern, members will work for the common good
of the people of Keystone and not for any private or personal interest, and
they will assure fair and equal treatment of all persons, claims and
transactions coming before them.
   (B)   Conduct their actions in accordance with law and policy. Members shall
comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and Town of Keystone
policies in the performance of their public duties.
   (C)   Conduct of members. The professional and personal conduct of members
while exercising the duties of their office must be above reproach and avoid
even the appearance of impropriety. Members shall refrain from abusive conduct,
personal charges, or verbal attacks upon the character or motives of other
members of Board, the staff, or public.
   (D)   Respect for process. Members shall perform their duties in accordance
with the processes and rules of order established by the Town Board.
   (E)   Conduct at public meetings. Members shall prepare themselves for
public issues; listen courteously and attentively to all public discussions
before the body; and focus on the business at hand.
   (F)   Decisions based on merit. Members shall base their decisions on the
merits and substance of the matter at hand, rather than on unrelated
considerations.
   (G)   Conflict of interest. All members shall identify and avoid conflicts
of interest in accordance with the law.
   (H)   Confidential information. Members shall maintain the confidentiality
of all written materials and verbal information provided to members which is
confidential or privileged. Members shall neither disclose confidential or
privileged information without proper legal authorization, nor use such
information to advance their personal, financial or other private interests.
   (I)   Use of public resources. Members shall not use public resources which
are not available to the public in general (e.g., town staff time, equipment,
supplies or facilities) for private gain or for personal purposes not otherwise
authorized by law.
   (J)   Representation of private interests. In keeping with their role as
stewards of the public interest, members of the Board shall not appear on
behalf of the private interests of third parties before the Board, or
proceeding of the town, nor shall members of the board and committees appear
before their own bodies or before the Board on behalf of the private interests
of third parties on matters related to the areas of service of their bodies.
   (K)   Advocacy. Members shall represent the official policies or positions
of the Town Board, to the best of their ability when designated as delegates
for this purpose. When presenting their individual opinions and positions,
members shall explicitly state they do not represent their body or the Town of
Keystone, nor will they allow the inference that they do. Board members and
committee members have the right to endorse candidates for all Board seats or
other elected offices. It is inappropriate to mention or display endorsements
during Board meetings, or other official town meetings.
   (L)   Policy role of members. Members shall respect and adhere to the
structure of Keystone Town government as outlined in the Town of Keystone Code,
organizational charts and job descriptions. In this structure, the Town Board
determines the policies of the town with the advice, information and analysis
provided by town staff, boards and committees, and the public. Except as
provided by the Town Code, members shall not interfere with the administrative
functions of the town or the professional duties of town staff; nor shall they
impair the ability of staff to implement Board policy decisions.
   (M)   Independence of boards and committees. Because of the value of the
independent advice of boards and committees to the public decision-making
process, members of the Board shall refrain from using their position to unduly
influence the deliberations or outcomes of the board and committee proceedings.
   (N)   Positive work place environment. Members shall support the maintenance
of a positive and constructive work place environment for town employees and
for citizens and businesses dealing with the town. Members shall recognize
their special role in dealings with town employees to in no way create the
perception of inappropriate direction to staff.
(Ord. passed 3-6-2024)
§ 37.03 CONDUCT.
   The conduct policies are designed to describe the manner in which elected
and appointed officials should treat one another, town staff, constituents, and
others they come into contact with while representing the Town of Keystone.
   (A)   Elected and appointed officials’ conduct with each other in public
meetings. Elected and appointed officials are individuals with a wide variety
of backgrounds, personalities, values, opinions, and goals. Despite this
diversity, all have chosen to serve in public office in order to preserve and
protect the present and the future of the community. In all cases, this common
goal should be acknowledged even though individuals may not agree on every
issue.
      (1)   Honor the role of the chair in maintaining order. It is the
responsibility of the chair to keep the comments of members on track during
public meetings. Members should honor efforts by the chair to focus discussion
on current agenda items. If there is disagreement about the agenda or the
chair’s actions, those objections should be voiced politely and with reason,
following procedures outlined in parliamentary procedure.
      (2)   Practice civility and decorum in discussions and debate. Difficult
questions, tough challenges to a particular point of view, and criticism of
ideas and information are legitimate elements of debate by a free democracy in
action. Free debate does not require nor justify, however, public officials to
make belligerent, personal, impertinent, slanderous, threatening, abusive, or
disparaging comments.
      (3)   Avoid personal comments that could offend other members. If a
member is personally offended by the remarks of another member, the offended
member should make notes of the actual words used and call for a "point of
personal privilege" that challenges the other member to justify or apologize
for the language used. The chair will maintain control of this discussion.
      (4)   Demonstrate effective problem-solving approaches. Members have a
public stage and have the responsibility to show how individuals with disparate
points of view can find common ground and seek a compromise that benefits the
community as a whole.
   (B)   Elected and appointed officials’ conduct with the public in public
meetings. Making the public feel welcome is an important part of the democratic
process. No signs of partiality, prejudice or disrespect should be evident on
the part of individual members toward an individual participating in a public
forum. Every effort should be made to be fair and impartial in listening to
public testimony.
      (1)   Be welcoming to speakers and treat them with care and gentleness.
While questions of clarification may be asked, the official’s primary role
during public testimony is to listen.
      (2)   Be fair and equitable in allocating public hearing time to
individual speakers. The chair will determine and announce limits on speakers
at the start of the public hearing process.
      (3)   Practice active listening. It is disconcerting to speakers to have
members not look at them when they are speaking. It is fine to look down at
documents or to make notes, but reading for a long period of time or gazing
around the room gives the appearance of disinterest. Members shall try to be
conscious of facial expressions, and avoid those that could be interpreted as
"smirking," disbelief, anger or boredom.
      (4)   Maintain an open mind. Members of the public deserve an opportunity
to influence the thinking of elected and appointed officials.
      (5)   Ask for clarification, but avoid debate and argument with the
public. Only the chair – not individual members – can interrupt a speaker
during a presentation. However, a member can ask the chair for a point of order
if the speaker is off the topic or exhibiting behavior or language the member
finds disturbing.
      (6)   Conduct of meetings. The Board President shall preside over the
meeting and keep order under the following guidelines:
         (a)   Members of the public addressing the Board shall do so from the
podium with the permission of the Board President.
         (b)   Members of the public addressing the Board shall begin their
remarks with their name.
         (c)   Belligerent, personal, impertinent, slanderous, threatening,
abusive, or disparaging comments will not be tolerated.
         (d)   No one in the Board Meeting Room shall be permitted to boo,
cheer, clap, or otherwise make an audible response to any person’s comments
during a public meeting.
         (e)   The Board President will determine and announce limits on
speakers at the start of the public hearing process.
   (C)   Elected and appointed officials’ conduct with town staff. Governance
of a town relies on the cooperative efforts of elected officials, who set
policy, appointed officials who advise the elected, and town staff who
implement and administer the Board’s policies. Therefore, every effort should
be made to be cooperative and show mutual respect for the contributions made by
each individual for the good of the community.
      (1)   Treat all staff as professionals. Clear, honest communication that
respects the abilities, experience, and dignity of each individual is expected.
Poor behavior towards staff is not acceptable.
      (2)   Do not disrupt town staff from their jobs. Elected and appointed
officials should not disrupt town staff while they are in meetings, on the
phone, or engrossed in performing their job functions in order to have their
individual needs met. Do not attend town staff meetings unless requested by
staff – even if the elected or appointed official does not say anything, his or
her presence may imply support, show partiality, intimidate staff, or hampers
staff’s ability to do their job objectively.
      (3)   Never publicly criticize an individual employee. Elected and
appointed officials should never express concerns about the performance of a
town employee in public, to the employee directly, or to the employee’s
manager. Comments about staff performance should only be made to the Town
Administrator through private correspondence or conversation. Appointed
officials should make their comments regarding staff to the Town Administrator
or the Board President.
      (4)   Do not solicit political support from staff. Elected and appointed
officials should not solicit any type of political support (financial
contributions, display of posters or lawn signs, name on support list, etc.)
from town staff. Town staff may, as private citizens with constitutional
rights, support political candidates but all such activities must be done away
from the workplace.
      (5)   No attorney-client relationship. Members shall not seek to
establish an attorney-client relationship with the Town Attorney, including his
or her staff and attorneys contracted to work on behalf of the town. The Town
Attorney represents the town and not individual members. Members who consult
with the Town Attorney cannot enjoy or establish an attorney-client
relationship with the attorney.
   (D)   Board conduct with boards and committees. The town has established
several boards and committees as a means of gathering more community input.
Citizens who serve on boards and committees become more involved in government
and serve as advisors to the Town Board. They are a valuable resource to the
town’s leadership and should be treated with appreciation and respect.
      (1)   If attending a board or committee meeting, be careful to only
express personal opinions. Board members may attend any board or committee
meeting, which are always open to any member of the public. However, they
should be sensitive to the way their participation could be viewed as unfairly
affecting the process. Any public comments by a Board member at a board or
committee meeting should be clearly made as individual opinion and not a
representation of the feelings of the entire Town Board.
      (2)   Limit contact with board and committee members to questions of
clarification. It is inappropriate for a Board member to contact a board or
committee member to advocate for or against an issue before that board or
committee. It is acceptable for Board members to contact board or committee
members in order to clarify a position taken by the board or committee.
      (3)   Respect that boards and committees serve the community, not
individual. Board members board and committee members do not report to
individual Board members, nor should Board members feel they have the power or
right to threaten board and committee members with removal if they disagree
about an issue. Appointment and re-appointment to a board or committee should
be based on such criteria as expertise, ability to work with staff and the
public, and commitment to fulfilling official duties. A board or committee
appointment should not be used as a political "reward."
      (4)   Be respectful of diverse opinions. A primary role of boards and
committees is to represent many points of view in the community and to provide
the Board with advice based on a full spectrum of concerns and perspectives.
Board members may have a closer working relationship with some individuals
serving on boards and committees, but must be fair and respectful of all
citizens serving on boards and committees.
      (5)   Keep political support away from public forums. Board and committee
members may offer political support to a Board member, but not in a public
forum while conducting official duties. Conversely, Board members may support
board and committee members who are running for office, but not in an official
forum in their capacity as a Board member.
(Ord. passed 3-6-2024)
§ 37.04 SANCTIONS.
   (A)   Acknowledgment of Code of Ethics and Conduct. Board members who do not
sign an acknowledgment that they have read and understand the Code of Ethics
and Conduct may be subject to discipline and shall be ineligible for
intergovernmental assignments or Board subcommittees. Board and committee
members who do not sign an acknowledgment that they have read and understand
the Code of Ethics and Conduct will be publicly acknowledged as not signing the
document during the first board meeting of the year.
   (B)   Behavior and conduct.
      (1)   The Keystone Code of Ethics and Conduct expresses standards of
ethical conduct expected for members of the Keystone Town Board, boards and
committees. Members themselves have the primary responsibility to assure that
ethical standards are understood and met, and that the public can continue to
have full confidence in the integrity of government. The chairs of boards and
committees and the Board President and Board members have the additional
responsibility to intervene when actions of members that appear to be in
violation of the Code of Ethics and Conduct are brought to their attention.
         (a)   Board members:
            1.   Board members who do not follow proper conduct may be
reprimanded or formally censured by the Board, lose committee assignments (both
within the Town of Keystone and with intergovernmental agencies) or other
privileges afforded by the Board. Serious infractions of the Code of Ethics or
Code of Conduct could lead to other sanctions as deemed appropriate by the
Board, including removal from office.
            2.   Individual Board members should point out to the offending
Board member perceived infractions of the Code of Ethics and Conduct. If the
offenses continue, then the matter should be referred to the Board President in
private. If the Board President is the individual whose actions are being
questioned, then the matter should be referred to the Board members and Finance
Officer. It is the responsibility of the Board President to initiate action if
a Board member’s behavior may warrant sanction. If no action is taken by the
Board President then the alleged violation(s) may be brought up with the full
Board.
         (b)   Board and committee members:
            1.   Counseling, verbal reprimands and written warnings may be
administered by the Board President to board and committee members failing to
comply with town policy. These lower levels of sanctions shall be kept private
to the degree allowed by law. Copies of all written reprimands administered by
the Board President shall be distributed in memo format to the chair of the
respective board or committee, the Town Attorney, the Town Administrator, and
the Town Board.
            2.   The Board President and Town Board may impose sanctions on
board and committee members whose conduct does not comply with the town’s
policies, up to and including removal from office. Any form of discipline
(excluding removal from office addressed in § 37.05 of this chapter) imposed by
Town Board shall be determined by a majority vote of at least a quorum of the
Board at a noticed public meeting and such action shall be preceded by a report
to Town Board with supporting documentation.
      (2)   When deemed warranted, the Board President or majority of Board may
call for an investigation of board or committee member conduct. Also, should
the Town Administrator or Town Attorney believe an investigation is warranted,
they shall confer with the Board President or Board. The Board President or
Board shall ask the Town Administrator or the Town Attorney to investigate the
allegation and report the findings.
      (3)   These sanctions are alternatives to any other remedy that might
otherwise be available to remedy conduct that violates this code or state or
federal law. In order to protect and preserve good government, any individual
including the Town Administrator and the Town Attorney, who knows or reasonably
believes a member acts or intends or refuses to act in a manner that is or may
be a violation of law reasonably imputable to the organization, or in a manner
which is likely to result in substantial injury to the organization, may report
the violation to the appropriate governmental authorities.
(Ord. passed 3-6-2024)
§ 37.05 EXTRAORDINARY SANCTION; REMOVAL FROM OFFICE.
   The Board of Trustees may expel and remove any member of the Board of
Trustees upon the following grounds: misconduct, malfeasance, nonfeasance,
crimes in office, drunkenness, gross incompetency, corruption, theft,
oppression, gross partiality, or any repeated violations of the Town of
Keystone’s Code of Conduct.
   (A)   If it appears to the Board of Trustees that a member has violated any
provisions of this chapter or grounds exist to expel and remove the violating
member, the Board of Trustees shall conduct a fair and public hearing on
whether the violating member should retain his or her appointed or elected
position as a member of the Keystone Board of Trustees.
   (B)   Any expulsion and removal of a member of the Board of Trustees shall
require a vote for expulsion and removal by four members of the Board of
Trustees.
(Ord. passed 3-6-2024)
§ 37.06 IMPLEMENTATION.
   (A)   The Code of Ethics and Conduct is intended to be self-enforcing and is
an expression of the standards of conduct for members expected by the town. It
therefore becomes most effective when members are thoroughly familiar with it
and embrace its provisions.
   (B)   For this reason, this chapter of the Town of Keystone Ordinances shall
be included in the regular orientations for candidates for Town Board, Town
Administrator, Town Attorney, applicants to board and committees, and newly
elected and appointed officials. Members entering office shall sign a statement
acknowledging they have read and understand the Code of Ethics and Conduct. In
addition, the Code of Ethics and Conduct shall be periodically reviewed by the
Town Board, boards and committees, and updated as necessary.

§ 51.18 REGULATING THE USE OF SEWER.
   (A)   Discharge of water. The Town Board has found that the discharge of
water from any roof, surface, ground, sump pump, footing tile or natural
precipitation from any other source into the town's sanitary sewer system may
flood and overload the sanitary sewer system, and cause detrimental effects to
the environment and is not allowed by the Town of Keystone. The overloading may
cause backup of sewage into the living quarters of residents and in addition to
other damage, create a hazard to health and additional charges to the town by
the EPA because of increased flow. The Town Board, therefore, finds it is
essential to the maintenance of health and to minimize damage to property and
to protect the town’s natural water resource, that the provisions of this
section be strictly enforced to avoid emergencies and detrimental affects to
the environment in the future.
   (B)   Definition and method. No water from any roof, surface, ground, sump
pump, footing tile or natural precipitation from any other source shall be
discharged into the sanitary sewer system. Sump pump systems shall have
permanently installed discharge lines which shall not at any time discharge
water into the sanitary sewer system, except as provided herein. A permanent
installation shall be 1 which provides for year-round discharge capability to
either the outside of the dwelling, building or structure, or is connected to
the town storm sewer or discharges through the curb and gutter to the street.
It shall consist of a rigid discharge line without valving or quick connections
for altering the path of discharge, and if connected to the town storm sewer
line, include a check valve.
   (C)   Disconnection. Any person, firm or corporation having a roof, surface,
ground, sump pump or footing tile now connected and or discharging into the
sanitary sewer system, shall disconnect and or remove the same. Any disconnects
or openings in the sanitary sewer shall be closed or repaired in an effective,
workman like manner, as approved by the Town of Keystone.
      (1)   Every person owning improved real estate that discharges into the
town's sanitary sewer system shall allow an employee of the Town of Keystone,
or his or her designated representative, to inspect the buildings to confirm
that there is no sump pump or other prohibited discharge into the sanitary
sewer system.
      (2)   Any person refusing to allow his or her property to be inspected
shall immediately become subject to the surcharge hereinafter provided for. Any
property found to violate the ordinance shall make the necessary changes to
comply with the ordinance, shall furnish proof of the changes to the town and
be inspected by the town within 30 days of notification of noncompliance.
      (3)   Notification of non-compliance will be given to the property owner
by the Town of Keystone at the time of inspection.
   (D)   Future violations.  At any future time the town may conduct random
inspections periodically, or if the town has reason to suspect that an illegal
connection exists in a premises, to insure compliance of this section.
   (E)   Variances.  The Town Board shall have the power and duty of hearing
and deciding requests for variances from the applicability of the provisions of
this section. Where strict enforcement would cause undue hardship because of
circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration or cause a
safety problem.
      (1)   Application for variances pursuant to this section shall be
addressed in writing to the Town of Keystone. The applications shall, at a
minimum, identify the property for which the variance is being applied for, the
name of the property owner/applicant and describe in detail what
characteristics of the subject property create an undue hardship or safety
concern.
      (2)   Within 30 days after application, the town shall make its order
deciding on the matter and serve a copy of the order upon the applicant by
mail. Upon receipt of an application for variance, the town shall allow the
property owner to temporarily discharge directly into the sanitary sewer
system. Upon approval of a variance, a property owner shall be allowed to
discharge directly into the sanitary sewer system as provided for in the
conditions of the approval.

§ 131.01 DISTURBING THE PEACE.
   Any person who willfully and wrongfully commits any act tending towards
disturbing the peace of another person, or which grossly disturbs the public
peace, is guilty of a misdemeanor. The causing or making of any unnecessary
loud noise, shouting or yelling, shall be considered a breach of the peace.
(1992 Code, § 9-3-1) (Ord. 31, § 14-1, passed 10-1-1975)
Statutory reference:
   Authority, see SDCL § 9-29-3
§ 131.02 DISORDERLY CONDUCT.
   Any person who shall, upon a public street, or in any public place, fight,
offer to fight or to use derisive, offensive or annoying words which have the
characteristics of exciting a breach of the peace, or who shall conduct himself
or herself in a disorderly manner, whether arising from drunkenness or
otherwise, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
(1992 Code, § 9-3-2) (Ord. 31, § 14-2, passed 10-1-1975)
§ 131.03 LOITERING.
   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect's escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk,
street, curb, cross-walk, walkway area, mall or that portion of private
property utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the
free passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any
person to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any
building open to the public.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter in or near any
thoroughfare or place open to the public for the purpose of inducing, enticing,
soliciting, or procuring another to commit an act of prostitution. Among the
circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such action is
consistent with the intent to induce, entice, solicit, or procure another to
commit an act of prostitution are that the person is a known prostitute or
panderer and repeatedly beckons, in the attempt to stop or engage male or
female passersby in conversation, or repeatedly stops or attempts to stop motor
vehicles by engaging their operators by hailing, waving of arms, or other
bodily gestures. The violator's conduct must be such as to demonstrate a
specific intent to induce, entice, solicit, or procure another to commit an act
of prostitution. No arrest shall be made for a violation of this division
unless the arresting officer first affords the person an opportunity to explain
his or her conduct, and no one shall be convicted of violating this division if
it appears at trial that the explanation given was true and disclosed a lawful
purpose.
   (D)   For the purpose of this section,  PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving  or not), and buildings open to the general public, including
those which serve food or drink or provide entertainment, and the doorways and
entrances to buildings or dwellings and the grounds enclosing them.

between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.

§ 131.04 ASSAULT AND BATTERY.
   No person shall attempt or offer, with force or violence, to do corporal
hurt to the person of another, nor shall any person use force or violence upon
the person of another, unless it is a case of justifiable or excusable assault
or battery, and any person committing an assault or assault and battery shall
be guilty of a misdemeanor.
(1992 Code, § 9-3-4) (Ord. 31, § 14-4, passed 10-1-1975) Penalty, see §
131.99
§ 131.05 MALICIOUS MISCHIEF.
   Any person who maliciously injures, defaces or otherwise damages or destroys
any real or personal property, public or private, and not his or her own, in
any case not otherwise specified in this chapter, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
(1992 Code, § 9-3-5) (Ord. 31, § 14-5, passed 10-1-1975)
§ 131.06 PETIT LARCENY.
   Larceny is the taking of a personal property accomplished by fraud or
stealth, and with the intent to deprive another thereof. Any person committing
larceny of property of less than $100 in value shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor.

   Any person who shall wilfully take possession of any goods, wares or
merchandise offered for sale by any store or other mercantile establishment,
with the intention of converting the same to his or her use without paying the
purchase price thereof, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person willfully
concealing un-purchased goods or merchandise of any store or other mercantile
establishment, either on the premises or outside of the premises of the store,
shall be prima facie presumed to have so concealed the article, with the
intention of converting the same to his or her own use without paying the
purchase price thereof, and the finding of the un-purchased goods or
merchandise concealed upon the person or among the belongings of the person
shall be prima facie evidence of willful concealment, and if the person
conceals, or causes to be concealed, the un-purchased goods or merchandise upon
the person or among the belongings of another, the finding of the same shall
also be prima facie evidence of willful concealment on the part of the person
so concealing the goods. Persons concealing the goods may be detained in a
reasonable manner for a reasonable length of time until the arrival of the
police, and the detention shall not render the merchant or his or her employees
criminally or civilly liable for false arrest, false imprisonment or unlawful
detention.
(1992 Code, § 9-3-7) (Ord. 31, § 14-7, passed 10-1-1975)

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context indicates or requires a different meaning.
   AREA OF FUTURE-CONDITIONS FLOOD HAZARD. The land area that would be
inundated by the 1% annual chance (100-year) flood based on future-conditions
hydrology.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO zone on a
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a 1% or greater annual chance
of flooding to an average depth of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly defined channel
does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity
flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD-RELATED EROSION HAZARD. The land within a community
which is most likely to be subject to severe flood-related erosion losses. The
area may be designated as Zone E on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After
the detailed evaluation of the special flood- related erosion hazard area; in
preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone E may be further refined.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the flood plain within a community
subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may
be designated as Zone A on the FHBM. After detailed ratemaking has been
completed in preparation for publication of the flood insurance rate map, Zone
A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, Al-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE,
AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, or V1-30, VE, or V. For purposes of these regulations,
the term "special flood hazard area" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase
"area of special flood hazard".
   BASE FLOOD.  The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The water surface elevation of the 1% annual
chance flood. The height in relation to mean sea level expected to be reached
by the waters of the base flood at pertinent points in the floodplains of
coastal and riverine areas.
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   BREAKAWAY WALL. A wall that is not part of the structural support of the
building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under
specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion
of the building or supporting foundation system.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION.  FEMA's comment on a proposed project
that would, upon construction, affect the hydrologic or hydraulic
characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the
existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood elevations, or the
special flood hazard area. The letter does not revise an effective map; it
indicates whether the project, if built as proposed, would be recognized by
FEMA.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   EROSION. The process of the gradual wearing away of land masses. This peril
is not per se covered under the program.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION. For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. EXISTING
CONSTRUCTION may also be referred to as "existing structures."
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   EXISTING STRUCTURES. See EXISTING CONSTRUCTION.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufacturing homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FLOOD or FLOODING means:
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from:
         (a)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
         (b)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
         (c)   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by
flooding as defined in paragraph (1)(b) of this definition and are akin to a
river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as
when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the
current.
      (2)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or
other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or
currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by
an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a
severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding as defined in paragraph (1)(a) of this definition.
   FLOOD ELEVATION DETERMINATION. A determination by the Administrator of the
water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the flood level that has a
1% or greater chance of occurrence in any given year.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
the Administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk
premium zones applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY or FLOOD ELEVATION STUDY. An examination, evaluation
and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water
surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide
(i.e., mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards.

inundated by water from any source (see definition of "flooding").
   FLOOD PROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOODWAY. See REGULATORY FLOODWAY.
   FLOODWAY ENCROACHMENT LINES. The lines marking the limits of floodways on
federal, state and local flood plain maps.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for purposes of flood plain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the
many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the
height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as
wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of
the watershed.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port
facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or
passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include
long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:

communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT. An official amendment, by letter, to an effective
map. A LOMA establishes a property's location in relation to the special flood
hazard area and is usually issued because a property has been inadvertently
mapped as being in the floodplain, but is actually on natural high ground above
the base flood elevation.
   LETTER OF MAP REVISION. FEMA's modification to an effective Flood Insurance
Rate Map, or Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, or both. LOMRs are generally
based on the implementation of physical measures that affect the hydrologic or
hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the
modification of the existing regulatory, the effective base flood elevations,
or the special flood hazard area.
   LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL. FEMA's modification of the special
flood hazard area shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map based on the placement
of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
   LEVEE.  A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM. A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in 1 or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a "recreational vehicle".
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MAP. The Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) for a community issued by the Agency.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are
referenced.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For the purposes of determining insurance rates,
structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is
later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
floodplain management purposes, new construction means structures for which the
start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGULATORY FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
designated height.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.  See AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   SPECIAL HAZARD AREA. An area having special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow),
or flood- related erosion hazards, and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO,
Al-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, AH, VO, Vl-30, VE, V,
M, or E.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION (for other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)),
includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building,
including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as
well as a manufactured home. STRUCTURE, for insurance purposes, means:
      (1)   A building with 2 or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured
roof, that is affixed to a permanent site;
      (2)   A manufactured home ("a manufactured home," also known as a mobile
home, is a structure built on a permanent chassis, transported to its site in
one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation); or
      (3)   A travel trailer without wheels built on a chassis and affixed to a
permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community's floodplain
management and building ordinances or laws.
For the latter purpose, STRUCTURE does not mean a recreational vehicle or a
park trailer or other similar vehicle, except as described in paragraph (3) of
this definition, or a gas or liquid storage tank.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a flood plain
management regulation.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's flood plain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR Sec. 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the flood plains of coastal or riverine
areas.
(1992 Code, § 4-2-1) (Ord. passed 3-6-2013)
§ 152.02 APPLICABLE LANDS.
   This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the
jurisdiction of the Town of Keystone.
(1992 Code, § 4-3-1) (Ord. passed 3-6-2013)
§ 152.03 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood
Insurance Study for Keystone" with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRM), dated March, 1980 and any revisions thereto are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
(1992 Code, § 4-3-2) (Ord. passed 3-6-2013)
§ 152.04 COMPLIANCE.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use
changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
applicable regulations.

§ 152.05 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(1992 Code, § 4-3-4) (Ord. passed 3-6-2013)
§ 152.06 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall
be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
(1992 Code, § 4-3-5) (Ord. passed 3-6-2013)
§ 152.07 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(1992 Code, § 4-3-6) (Ord. passed 3-6-2013)
STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
§ 152.20 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   (A)   The Legislature of the State of South Dakota has in SDCL Ch. 9-36 and
§ 7-18-14 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the Board of Trustees
of the Town of Keystone, South Dakota, does ordain as follows:
   (B)   The Town of Keystone elects to comply with the requirements of the
National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as amended). The National
Flood Insurance Program, established in the aforesaid act, provides that areas
of the town having a special flood hazard be identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency and that floodplain management measures be applied
in such flood hazard areas. The National Flood Insurance Program was broadened
and modified with the passage of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 and
other legislative measures. It was further modified by the National Flood
Insurance Reform Act of 1994. The National Flood Insurance Program is
administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a component of the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
(1992 Code, § 4-1-1) (Ord. passed 3-6-2013)
Statutory reference:
   Authority, see SDCL Ch. 9-36 and § 7-18-14
§ 152.21 FINDINGS OF FACT; FLOOD HAZARD AREAS.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of Keystone are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(1992 Code, § 4-1-2) (Ord. passed 3-6-2013)
§ 152.22 PURPOSE OF CHAPTER.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions to specific areas by provisions designed:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in floodplains;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   (G)   To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a
flood area.
(1992 Code, § 4-1-3) (Ord. passed 3-6-2013)
§ 152.23 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(1992 Code, § 4-1-4) (Ord. passed 3-6-2013)

agencies (including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is required.
   (E)   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.
   (F)   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the State
Coordinating Agency which is Keystone, prior to any alteration or relocation of
a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
   (G)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.
   (H)   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance,
the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation data and floodway data available from a federal, state or
other source, in order to administer the provisions of this chapter.
   (I)   When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the Floodplain
Administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and
AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than 1 foot at any point within the community.
   (J)   Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain
development in Zones Al-30, AE, AH, on the community's FIRM which increases the
water surface elevation of the base flood by more than 1 foot, provided that
the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA
(Conditional Letter of Map Revision).

§ 152.44 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   The Appeal Board as established by the community shall hear and render
judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
   (A)   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board
may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
   (B)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and the State Office of Emergency Management upon issuing a
variance.
   (C)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in §
152.43 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
   (D)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter.
   (E)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (G)   Prerequisites for granting variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (H)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that:
      (1)   The criteria outlined in this section are met, and
      (2)   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.
   (I)   A CLOMR is required only for those projects that will:
      (1)   BFE/no floodway (demonstrate <1.0 ft increase)
         (a)   A project on a stream or river that has been studied through
detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses and for which base flood elevations
(BFEs) have been specified, but a floodway has not been designated. If the
developer/property owner/community proposes to allow development that would
result in more than a 1.0 foot increase in the BFE, a CLOMR must first be
obtained.
         (b)   44 CFR 60.3 (c)(10): Result in an increase in the base flood
water-surface elevation (WSEL) of greater than 1.00 foot for streams with BFEs
specified but no regulatory floodway designated.
      (2)   BFE/floodway (no-rise)
         (a)   The second situation requiring a CLOMR is for a project on a
stream or river for which detailed analyses have been conducted and BFEs and a
floodway have been designated. If the community proposes to allow development
totally or partially within the floodway that would result in any (greater than
0.0 foot) increase in the BFE, a CLOMR must be obtained.
         (b)   44 CFR 60.3 (d)(3): Result in any base flood WSEL increase from
proposed construction within a regulatory floodway.
   (J)   LOMRs are required under 44 CFR 65.3.
(Ord. passed 3-6-2013)
§ 152.45 PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE.
   (A)   In accordance with Section 59.2(b) of CFR 44, Chapter 1, of the
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulation, to qualify for the sale of
federally subsidized flood insurance, a community must adopt floodplain
management regulations that meet or exceed the minimum standards of Section 60.
"These regulations must include effective enforcement provisions." In
accordance with Section 60.1(b) of CFR 44, Chapter 1, of the NFIP regulations,
"These regulations must be legally-enforceable, applied uniformly throughout
the community to all privately and publicly owned land within flood-prone (i.e.
mudflow) or flood-related erosion areas, and the community must provide that
the regulations take precedence over less restrictive conflicting local laws,
ordinances or codes."
   (B)   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located,
extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this
chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this
chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations
of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or
imprisoned, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs
and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the
Town of Keystone from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation.
(Ord. passed 3-6-2013)
PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 152.65 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required
for all new construction and substantial improvements:
   (A)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
   (B)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
   (C)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials resistant to flood damage;
   (D)   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.
   (E)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
   (F)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and
discharge from the systems into flood waters; and
   (G)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding.
(Ord. passed 3-6-2013)
§ 152.66 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has
been provided, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement),
elevated to 1 foot above the base flood elevation. A registered professional
engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the
Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this chapter are satisfied.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to 1 foot
above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are flood
proofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   Enclosures.  New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which
are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
      (1)   A minimum of 2 openings having a total net area of not less than 1
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be
provided.
      (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than 1 foot above
grade.
      (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
   (D)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a
community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which
minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes
must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition
to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
      (2)   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within Zones Al-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i)
outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured
home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a
result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest
floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation
and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      (3)   In A-1-30, AH, and AE Zones, require that manufactured homes to be
placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park to be
elevated so that the lowest floor is at or above the base flood elevation; OR
the chassis is supported by reinforced piers no less than 36 inches in height
above grade and securely anchored.
   (E)   Recreational vehicles.  Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within Zones Al-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either:
      (1)   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
      (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
      (3)   Meet the permit requirements of §
152.43, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes"
of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on
its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
(Ord. passed 3-6-2013)
§ 152.67 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (A)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development
permit requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is
lesser.
   (D)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazards.
   (E)   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage.
(Ord. passed 3-6-2013)
§ 152.68 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES).
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in §
152.03 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly
defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable
and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by
ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified).
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures;
      (1)   Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified); or
      (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed
so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
   (C)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in §
152.43, are satisfied.
   (D)   Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed
structures.
(Ord. passed 3-6-2013)
§ 152.69 FLOODWAYS.
   Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
152.03, are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of flood waters which
carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply:
   (A)   Designate a regulatory floodway which will not increase the base flood
level more than 1 foot.
   (B)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (C)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
152.65 et seq.
   (D)   Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments
within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base
flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional
FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.

CHAPTER 153: MOBILE HOMES
Section
   
153.01   Mobile homes; permits and skirting
§ 153.01 MOBILE HOMES; PERMITS AND SKIRTING.
   (A)   All mobile homes within the territorial jurisdiction of the Town of
Keystone, shall be provided with skirting from the bottom of the walls to the
ground within 30 days following occupancy. This skirting must be constructed of
fire-retardant materials.
   (B)   For purposes of this chapter, the term MOBILE HOME is defined as a
movable living unit designed for year around occupancy which is capable of
being towed on its own chassis.
   (C)   All owners of mobile homes who move their mobile homes into the
territorial jurisdiction of the Town of Keystone, who intend to relocate their
mobile home to a different location within the territorial jurisdiction of
Keystone or who intend to move their mobile home from the territorial
jurisdiction of the Town of Keystone to another location outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the Town of Keystone, shall make application for a
permit from the Town of Keystone Finance Officer on forms provided by the Town
of Keystone Finance Office. The application shall be accompanied by a fee of
$25.
   (D)   In the event an applicant commences moving a trailer into, out of, or
within town boundaries which would require the issuance of a permit under this
chapter prior to the issuance of a permit the applicant shall pay a fee of $250
per instance. This additional fee shall not preclude the town from exercising
other remedies as provided by state law or town ordinances.
