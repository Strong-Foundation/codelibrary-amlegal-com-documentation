rearranged, renumbered, and consolidated into component codes, titles,
chapters, and sections, shall be known and designated as the “Whitewood City

shall be by the following rules, unless that construction is plainly repugnant

applicable.

§ 51.050 JOINTS AND CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   All joints and connections shall be made gas-tight and water-tight.
Cast iron pipe joints shall be firmly packed with oakum or hemp and filled with
molten lead. Federal specifications (QQ-L-156), not less than one inch deep.
Lead shall be run in on pouring and caulking tight. No paint, varnish, or other
coatings shall be permitted on the jointing material until after the joint has
been tested and approved.
   (B)   All joints in vitrified clay pipe or between such pipe and metals
shall be made with approved hot-poured jointings material or cold mix asphalt
materials, or cement mortar as specified below.
   (C)   Material for hot poured joints shall not soften sufficiently to
destroy the effectiveness of the joint when subjected to a temperature of
160°F, nor to be soluble in any wastes carried by the drainage system. The
joint shall first be caulked tight with jute, hemp, or similar approved
material. Commercial cold mix asphalt compounds shall be used. This material
shall be designed for sewer jointings purposes and other compounds shall not be
used. The joint shall be caulked as for hot mix material.
   (D)   Cement joints shall be made by packing a clearly twisted jute or oakum
gasket, of suitable size, to fill partly the annular space between the pipes.
The remaining space shall be filled and firmly compacted with mortar composed
of one part Portland cement and three parts mortar sand. The material shall be
mixed dry; only sufficient water shall be added to make the mixture workable.
Mortar, which has begun to set, shall not be used or retempered. Lime putty or
hydrated lime may be substituted to the extent of not more than 25% of the
volume of the Portland cement that may be added.

(Prior Code, § 52.050)
§ 51.051 BRANCHES.
   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at
the “Y” branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If the
public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less and no properly located “Y”
branch in the public sewer at the location specified by the Superintendent, or
other officer or employee of the city appointed for such purpose. Where the
public sewer is greater than 12 inches in diameter, and no properly located “Y”
branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer to receive
the building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about
45 degrees. A 45-degree ell may be used to make such connection, with the
spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer.
The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at the
same or at a higher elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth,
neat joint shall be made, and the connection made secure with water-tight by
encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection in
concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by
the Superintendent, or other officer or employee of the city appointed for such
purposes.

   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting the
words “Go,” “Caution,” or “Stop,” or exhibiting different colored lights
successively one at a time, or with an arrow, the following colors only shall
be used, and said terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of
vehicles and pedestrians as follows.
   (A)   Green alone or “Go.” Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left, unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians
lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk, at the time such
signal is exhibited.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone. Vehicular traffic facing the signal is hereby
warned that the red of the “Stop” signal will be exhibited immediately
thereafter, and such vehicle or traffic shall not enter or be crossing the
intersection when the red or “Stop” signal is exhibited. Pedestrians facing
such signal are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the
roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to cross shall yield the right-of-way
to all vehicles.
   (C)   Steady red alone, or “Stop.”
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until green or “Go” is
shown alone, except as hereinafter provided.
      (2)   (a)   When the Common Council may permit, the driver of a vehicle
which is stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the intersection in
obedience to a red or “Stop” signal may make a right turn, but shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by signal
at said intersection.
         (b)   Such Common Council action permitting a right turn after a stop
when facing a steady red light alone shall be effective when a sign is erected
at such intersection giving notice thereof.
   (D)   Steady red with green arrow.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, but shall yield
the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk, and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
or she can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
      (3)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions which, by
their nature, can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic sign
or signal, it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows.
         (a)   Flashing red. When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a “Stop” sign.
         (b)   Flashing yellow. When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection
or past such signal only with caution. This section shall not apply at railroad
grade crossings. Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade
crossing shall be governed elsewhere in this title.

basis except as further provided by this chapter.

beginning at the opening of the business the day following the Common Council
meeting at which the last application was acted upon pursuant to the invitation
for applications. Such applications must be delivered in writing to the finance
office no earlier than the time specified above, and applications received
before such time are deemed rejected.
      (9)   If the numerical cap is then reached while using the first come,
first served system, and a license subsequently lapses making a license
available, these special procedures shall apply to issuing the license.
   (D)   Renewal process.
      (1)   A person or entity operating pursuant to a license must apply for
renewal of such license at least 45 days, but not more than 90 days, prior to
the expiration of such license using the form provided by the finance office.
Such application must include payment of the renewal application fee.
      (2)   The Common Council will consider renewal applications using the
same factors and timelines applicable to new applications. In addition, the
Common Council may consider in approving, denying, or conditionally approving a
renewal application, any changed information from prior applications, concerns
over actual operations or violations, nonpayment of obligations, or any other
information reasonably related to the continued operation of the cannabis
establishment.
      (3)   Preference may be granted to existing license holders based on a
dispensary’s community involvement, facility upkeep and investment, days and

person, people, or entity, the licensee and the proposed transferee must
complete a transfer application. Such transfer application must include all
information required for a new application as to the proposed transferee and
pay a transfer application fee. The Common Council shall then approve, deny, or

changes are not minor and substantially alter the operation of the cannabis
establishment as previously approved, the Mayor shall direct the matter to be
placed on the agenda of the next available Common Council meeting. The Common
Council shall then approve, deny, or conditionally approve the proposed changes
using the same factors and timetables as apply to renewal applications. For
changes referred to the Common Council, the applicant shall also pay a full
modification fee.

for relief may include seeking a temporary restraining order, temporary
injunction, and permanent injunction.

licensee may no longer legally possess cannabis, cannabis products, or other
restricted items, the licensee shall be responsible to pay the costs incurred

§ 150.028 GRADING AND EROSION CONTOLS.
   (A)   Introduction; purpose; applicability.
      (1)   During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to
erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing
water quality and adversely affects aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers, ditches and
the dredging of lakes, ponds, and streams. In addition, clearing and grading
during construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for
terrestrial and aquatic habitat.
      (2)   The purpose of this section is to safeguard persons, protect
property, and prevent damage to the environment in the city. This section will
also promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating, and controlling the
design, construction, use, and maintenance of any development or other activity
that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land
in the city.
      (3)   Unless specifically exempted, these regulations apply to all lands
within the city in which the vegetative cover is removed, disturbed, or fill
material has been brought onto the site requiring stabilization.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this subchapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      ARSD. Administrative Rules of South Dakota.
      BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs). Schedules of activities, prohibitions
of practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent
or reduce the discharge of pollutants to waters of the state. BMPs also include
treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control plant
site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge, or waste disposal or drainage from raw
material storage.
      CLEARING. Any activity that removes the vegetative surface cover.
      DRAINAGE WAY. Any channel that conveys surface runoff throughout the
site.
      GRADING AND EROSION CONTROL PLAN (GECP). A set of plans indicating the
specific measures and sequencing used to control sediment and erosion on a
construction site. (Required for all sites one-half acre or greater.)
      GRADING PERMIT. A permit issued by the city for construction, excavating,
clearing, and/or any land disturbing activity.
      LAND DISTURBANCE/DISTURBING ACTIVITY. Any type of activity that involves
grading, clearing, and/or moving topsoil, rock, or any other natural surface
from property. This term also includes bringing fill material onto the site.
      NOTICE OF STABILIZATION/RE-VEGETATION AGREEMENT. A signed agreement
between a property buyer and property seller or a building contractor and
property buyer where landscaping and re-vegetation will be required. This

public storm drain.
      WATERS OF THE STATE. All waters within the jurisdiction of this state,
including all streams, lakes, ponds, impounding reservoirs, marshes,
watercourses, waterways, wells, springs, irrigation systems, drainage systems
and all other bodies or accumulations of water, surface or underground, natural
or artificial, public or private, situated wholly or partly within or bordering
upon the state, but not waste treatment systems, including treatment ponds or
lagoons designed to meet the requirements of the CWA (Clean Water Act) other
than cooling ponds as defined by the Code of Federal Regulations.
   (C)   Grading permit(s).
      (1)   Unless otherwise exempt, a grading permit will be required prior to
persons engaging in a land disturbing activity exceeding 1,000 square feet. The
following requirements must be met before the permit will be granted:
         (a)   General permit for storm water discharges associated with
construction activities through SD DANR as required by state regulations for
land disturbing activity of one acre or more;
         (b)   General permit for storm water discharges associated with
Industrial Activities through SD DANR as required by state regulations. The
requirements for this permit are governed by the Standard Industrial Code
(SIC). There are no size requirements for this permit; and
         (c)   Approval of the SWPPP by the City Public Works Department. The
SWPPP is a requirement for both divisions (1)(a) and (1)(b) above.
      (2)   A grading permit with a grading and erosion control plan (GECP)
will be required for persons wishing to engage in land disturbing activity of
one-half acre up to one acre upon obtaining approval of a GECP by the City
Public Works Department.

         (c)   Land disturbing activity of less than 1,000 square feet.
      (5)   All permits will remain active until permanent landscaping measures
have been met on the site. Permanent stabilization/re-vegetation must be met by
October 31 of the year following completion of the project or occupancy of the
project. For example: if the project is completed in July of 2011, then
permanent landscaping/re-vegetation must be complete by October 31, 2012.
Projects larger than one-half acre may be required to be stabilized,
landscaped, or re-vegetated in phases to prevent long-term exposure of soils.
      (6)   Persons not subject to a grading permit, but who are engaging in a
land disturbing activity, are responsible for applying effective BMPs and will
be subject to the penalties set forth in §
150.999.
   (D)   Application and bond.
      (1)   Before any such permit is issued, the person requiring the same
shall make written application to the City Finance Officer, which shall state
where such excavation is to be made, the extent thereof, in front of which lot
or lots, and for what purpose the excavation is to be made. Before any permit
is issued to any such person, a good and sufficient bond for $5,000 could be
required to cover such excavation. Only one bond is necessary for any number of
authorized excavations as long as the bond is in full force and in effect.
      (2)   In addition, there shall be required a certificate of insurance
showing that the applicant has a liability policy covering business operations
including coverage for explosion, collapse and underground utilities, commonly
referred to as NCU coverage. If the City Finance Officer and/or Public Works
Director, after careful examination, find that application is in proper order
and in conformance with the provisions herein, and if said bond has been
properly posted and a certificate of liability has been filed, he or she may
issue said permit to the applicant.
(Prior Code, § 11.0604)
   (E)   Grading and erosion control plan. For sites of one-half acre or
larger, the grading and erosion control plan must include:
      (1)   A legible map identifying area to be disturbed, slopes, and
resources to be protected and also must include nearest downstream storm water
inlets, drainage ways, and neighboring property lines. This plan must be
approved and BMPs must be in place before any grading begins. The minimum map
size for sites one-half to one acre is eight and one-half inches by 11 inches;
for construction sites disturbing more than one acre and industrial sites,
minimum map size is 11 inches by 17 inches;
      (2)   The SWPPP for divisions (C)(1)(a) and (C)(1)(b) above is required
for submittal as the ESCP for this section;
      (3)   All BMPs necessary to achieve soil stabilization on the site itself
and including stockpiles of any soil, rock or any additional landscaping
materials on the site. The plan will also include a designated entry/exit
point, a concrete washout area on the site, measures to protect nearest
downstream storm water inlet(s) and explain measures to prevent mud-tracking
from vehicles and equipment into the street; and
      (4)   Sites up to one-half acre which are not subject to a GECP will be
required to apply all BMPs necessary to accomplish soil stabilization based
upon the soil conditions and topography of the particular site. A GECP may be
required in these areas when sites are consistently noncompliant with this
code. Final stabilization requirements set forth in division (K) below are
required for these sites.
   (F)   Deposit forfeited. If at any time within one year of the issuance of a
permit in making excavation, the Public Works Director or Building Inspector
shall find that the work for which the deposit on bond was made does not stand
a satisfactory test or has not been properly refilled, then the Public Works
Director or Building Inspector shall have the authority to cause such work to
be put in proper and satisfactory condition and charge the cost thereof to the
sum deposited or the surety bond furnished. This deposit shall be returned upon
certification by the Public Works Director or Building Inspector that all work
required has been performed satisfactorily.
(Prior Code, § 11.0605)
   (G)   Non-applicable to utility companies. No utility company which has been
heretofore granted by franchise or contract, the right to use the streets,
alleys, or other public places shall be required to furnish a bond for making
any excavations to any public rights-of-way; provided that all of the sections
of this chapter relating to excavations in public rights-of-way shall be
binding upon such companies.
(Prior Code, § 11.0606)
   (H)   Protection of utilities. Public utilities or services shall be
protected from damage caused by grading or excavation operations. Any damage
this committed shall be fully compensated for by the person of whom the permit
was granted to make said excavation.
(Prior Code, § 11.0607)
   (I)   Protection of adjacent property. Adjacent properties shall be
protected from damage caused by grading operations. No person shall excavate on
land sufficiently close to the property line to endanger any adjoining public
streets, sidewalk, alley, or other public or private property, without
supporting and protecting such property from any damage that might result.
(Prior Code, § 11.0608)
   (J)   Inspection notice. The Public Works Director and/or the Building
Inspector shall be notified at least 24 hours prior to the start of work.
(Prior Code, § 11.0609)
   (K)   Final stabilization.
      (1)   All soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and
either of the two following criteria are met:
         (a)   Uniform (e.g., evenly distributed, without large bare areas)
perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70% of the native background
vegetative cover for the area has been established on all unpaved areas and
areas not covered by permanent structures; and/or
         (b)   Equivalent permanent stabilization measures (such as the use of
riprap, retaining walls or geotextiles) have been employed.
      (2)   When background native vegetation naturally covers less than 100%
of the ground, the 70% coverage criteria is adjusted as follows: 70% of the
total area covered by native vegetation must have total cover for final
stabilization. For example, if native vegetation covers 50% of the ground, 35%
would require total cover for final stabilization. In an area where limited
vegetation is naturally found, less stabilization will be required.
      (3)   For individual lots in residential construction, FINAL
STABILIZATION means that either:
         (a)   The property owner/contractor has completed final stabilization
as specified under division (K)(1) above; or
         (b)   The property owner/contractor has established adequate temporary
stabilization including perimeter controls for an individual lot prior to
occupation of the property by the new property owner(s) and has informed the
property owner(s) of the need for, and benefits of, final stabilization. A
signed notice of stabilization/re-vegetation agreement form will acknowledge
the landscaping requirements of the new owner.
      (4)   (a)   For construction projects on land used for agricultural
purposes (e.g., pipelines across crop or range land, staging areas for road
construction, and the like), final stabilization may be accomplished by
returning the disturbed land to its preconstruction agricultural use.
         (b)   Areas disturbed that were not previously used for agricultural
activities, such as buffer strips immediately adjacent to a watercourse, and
areas which are not being returned to their preconstruction agricultural use
must meet the final stabilization criteria in divisions (K)(1) or (K)(2) above.
      (5)   Final stabilization must be completed on or before October 31 of
the year following the certificate of occupancy, final inspection, or project
completion, whichever occurs sooner.
   (L)   Additional requirements.
      (1)   It will be the responsibility of the grading permit holder to
obtain approval of all required agencies for any waterway crossings to be
installed if a wet watercourse will be crossed regularly during construction.
(e.g., DANR, Corps of Engineers, FEMA, and the like).
      (2)   SWPPPs must be maintained on the site during the progress of the
work.
      (3)   If control measures do not achieve stabilization, the permit holder
may be required to submit an updated SWPPP or may be required to submit a GECP
prepared by a professional engineer.
      (4)   Any on-site debris with potential to be wind-blown onto neighboring
properties must be controlled and refuse containers must be covered with a
cover intended for the container. Tarpaulins used to cover open dumpsters must
be intact and in good repair during use.
      (5)   The City Public Works Department may enter the site to make
inspections as needed.
   (M)   Stop work order.
      (1)   Whenever the Public Works Administrator or his or her designee
finds a site maintained contrary to the provisions of this section, the Public
Works Administrator or his or her designee is authorized to issue a stop work
order for the site.
      (2)   The stop work order shall be in writing and issued to the permittee
or assigned contractor. Upon issuance, the cited work shall immediately cease.
The stop work order shall state the reasons for the order and the conditions
under which the cited work will be permitted to resume.
      (3)   Any person who shall continue any work after having been served a
stop work order, with exception to work required by the order, shall be subject
to penalties set forth in §
150.999.
   (N)   Traffic control and protection of streets. Any person receiving a
permit to make excavation shall during the progress and continuance of the work
on such excavation erect and maintain around the same both by day and night
suitable flaggers, barricades, fences, signs, and other safety devices so as to
prevent injury to persons, animals, or vehicles on account of such excavation.
(Prior Code, § 11.0611)
   (O)   Hazard from existing grading. Whenever any existing excavation,
embankment, or fill has become a hazard to life or limb, endangers structures,
or adversely affects the safety, use, or stability of a public way or drainage
channel, such excavation, embankment, or fill shall be eliminated.
(Prior Code, § 11.0612)
   (P)   Tracking of dirt onto public streets during excavations. Adequate
cleaning of equipment to prevent the tracking of dirt and debris onto public
streets shall be provided during excavating.

      (1)   General permit for storm water discharges associated with
construction activities through SD DANR as required by state regulations for
land disturbing activity of one acre or more.
      (2)   General permit for storm water discharges associated with
industrial activities through SD DANR as required by state regulations. The
requirements for this permit are governed by the Standard Industrial Code
(SIC). There are no size requirements for this permit.
      (3)   Approval of the SWPPP by the City Public Works Department. The
SWPPP is a requirement for both divisions (A)(1) and (A)(2) above.
   (B)   A grading permit with a grading and erosion control plan will be
required for persons wishing to engage in land disturbing activity of one-half
acre up to one acre upon obtaining approval of a GECP by the City Public Works
Department.
   (C)   The grading permit designates the name, address, and phone number for
person(s) (including emergency contact information) responsible for erosion
control measure implementation and maintenance.
   (D)   No grading permit will be required for the following activities:
      (1)   Any emergency activity that is immediately needed for the
protection of life, property, or natural resources;
      (2)   Any nursery and agricultural operations that is permitted by zoning
regulations as a main or accessory use; or
      (3)   Land disturbing activity of less than 1,000 square feet.
   (E)   All permits will remain active until permanent landscaping measures
have been met on the site. Permanent stabilization/re-vegetation must be met by
October 31 of the year following completion of the project. For example, if the
project is competed in July 2011, then permanent landscaping/re-vegetation must
be complete by October 31, 2012. Projects larger than one-half acre may be
required to be stabilized, landscaped, or re-vegetated in phases to prevent
long-term exposure of soils.
   (F)   Persons not subject to a grading permit, but who are engaging in a
land disturbing activity, are responsible for applying effective BMPs and will
be subject to penalties set forth in §
151.999.
(Ord. 2022-01, passed 2-7-2022) Penalty, see §
151.999
§ 151.083 GRADING AND EROSION CONTROL PLAN.
   For sites of one-half acre or larger, the grading and erosion control plan
must include:
   (A)   A legible map identifying area to be disturbed, slopes, and resources
to be protected and also must include nearest downstream storm water inlets,
drainage ways, and neighboring property lines. This plan must be approved and
BMPs must be in place before any grading begins. The minimum map size for sites
one-half to one acre is eight and one-half inches by 11 inches; for
construction sites disturbing more than one acre and industrial sites, minimum
map size is 11 inches by 17 inches.
   (B)   The SWPPP for divisions (A)(1) and (A)(2) in §
151.082 is required for submittal as the ESCP for this section.
   (C)   All BMPs necessary to achieve soil stabilization on the site itself
and including stockpiles of any soil, rock, or any additional landscaping
materials on the site. The plan will also include a designated entry/exit
point, a concrete washout area on the site, measures to protect the nearest
downstream storm water inlet(s), and explain measures to prevent mud-tracking
from vehicles and equipment into the street.
   (D)   Sites up to one-half acres which are not subject to a GECP will be
required to apply all BMPs necessary to accomplish soil stabilization based
upon the soil conditions and topography of the particular site. A GECP may be
required in these areas when sites are consistently noncompliant with this
subchapter. Final stabilization requirements set forth in §
151.084 are required for these sites.
(Ord. 2022-01, passed 2-7-2022)
§ 151.084 FINAL STABILIZATION.
   (A)   All soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and
either of the two following criteria are met:
      (1)   Uniform (for example, evenly distributed, without large bare areas)
perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70% of the native background
vegetative cover for the area has been established on all unpaved areas and
areas not covered by permanent structures; or
      (2)   Equivalent permanent stabilization measures (such as the use of
riprap, retaining walls, or geotextiles) have been employed.
   (B)   When background native vegetation naturally covers less than 100% of
the ground, the 70% coverage criteria is adjusted as follows: 70% of the total
area covered by native vegetation must have total cover for final
stabilization. For example, if native vegetation covers 50% of the ground, 35%
would require total cover for final stabilization. In an area where limited
vegetation is naturally found, less stabilization will be required.
   (C)   For individual lots in residential construction, FINAL STABILIZATION
means either:
      (1)   The property owner/contractor has completed final stabilization as
specified in this section under division (A) above; or
      (2)   The property owner/contractor has established adequate temporary
stabilization including perimeter controls for an individual lot prior to the
occupation of the property by the new property owner(s) and has informed the
property owner(s) of the need for, and the benefits of, final stabilization. A
signed “Notice of Stabilization/Re-Vegetation Agreement” form will acknowledge
the landscaping requirements of the new owner.
   (D)   For construction projects on land used for agricultural purposes (for
example, pipelines across crop or range land, staging areas for road
construction, and the like), final stabilization may be accomplished by
returning the disturbed land to its preconstruction agricultural use. Areas
disturbed that were not previously used for agricultural activities, such as
buffer strips immediately adjacent to a watercourse and areas which are not
being returned to their preconstruction agricultural use, must meet the final
stabilization criteria in divisions (A) or (B) above.
   (E)   Final stabilization must be completed on or before October 31 of the
year following the certificate of occupancy, final inspection, or project
completion, whichever occurs sooner.
(Ord. 2022-01, passed 2-7-2022)
§ 151.085 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   It will be the responsibility of the grading permit holder to obtain
approval of all required agencies for any waterway crossings to be installed if
a wet watercourse will be crossed regularly during construction (for example,
DANR, Corps of Engineers, FEMA, and the like).
   (B)   SWPPP’s must be maintained on the site during the progress of the
work.
   (C)   If control measures do not achieve stabilization, the permit holder
may be required to submit an updated SWPPP or may be required to submit a GECP
prepared by a professional engineer.
   (D)   Any on-site debris with potential to be windblown onto neighboring
properties must be controlled, and refuse containers must be covered with a
cover intended for the container. Tarpaulins used to cover open dumpsters must
be intact and in good repair during use.
   (E)   The City Public Works Department may enter the site to make
inspections as needed.
(Ord. 2022-01, passed 2-7-2022)
§ 151.086 STOP WORK ORDER.
   (A)   Authority. Whenever the Public Works Administrator, or designee, finds
a site maintained contrary to the provisions of this subchapter, the Public
Works Administrator, or designee, is authorized to issue a stop work order for
the site.
   (B)   Issuance. The stop work order shall be in writing and issued to the
permittee or assigned contractor. Upon issuance, the cited work shall
immediately cease. The stop work order shall state the reasons for the order
and the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume.
   (C)   Unlawful continuance. Any person who shall continue any work after
having been served a stop work order, with exception to work required by the
order, shall be subject to penalties set forth in §
151.999.
(Ord. 2022-01, passed 2-7-2022) Penalty, see §
151.999
§ 151.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which no
specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §
10.99. In addition, to protect public property and the public interest, the
city shall have the authority to clean, stabilize, or re-vegetate its own
rights-of-way due to noncompliant permit holders. The city shall also have the
authority to assess the permit holder for the work performed, in addition to
all other remedies.

   (D)   For purposes of this chapter, EXTERIOR FEATURES shall include the
architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of the exterior of
a building or other structure, including the kind and texture of the building
material and the type and style of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs,
and other appurtenant features. In the case of outdoor advertising signs,
EXTERIOR FEATURES shall be construed to mean the style, material, size, and
location of all such signs. Changes in the EXTERIOR FEATURES of a building or
structure shall include proposed new construction or demolition.
   (E)   The Historic District Commission shall not review plans that involve
changes to the interior of a building or structure. As to exterior features,
the Historic District Commission shall only act for the purpose of preventing
the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving, or
demolition of buildings, structures, appurtenant features, or outdoor
advertising signs in the historic district which would be incongruous with the
historical, architectural, archaeological, or cultural aspects of the district.
   (F)   The Historic District Commission shall adopt guidelines to help in its
review of proposed work. The guidelines shall include the U.S. Secretary of the
Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating
Historic Buildings, and they may include other guidelines appropriate for
historic buildings and structures in the city. The Historic District Commission
may expand or amend the guidelines it has adopted.
   (G)   Prior to the review of an application for a certificate of
appropriateness, the Historic District Commission shall inform the owners of
property likely to be materially affected by the application and shall give the
applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard. In cases where the
Historic District Commission deems it necessary, it may hold a public hearing
concerning the application.
   (H)   (1)   If the Historic District Commission determines that the proposed
construction, reconstruction, alteration, moving, or demolition is appropriate,
it shall promptly approve the application and shall issue a certificate of
appropriateness.
      (2)   If the Historic District Commission determines that a certificate
of appropriateness should not be issued, it shall place in its records the
reasons for this determination and shall promptly notify the applicant,
furnishing the applicant an attested copy of its reasons and its
recommendations, if any.
      (3)   The Historic District Commission shall act on the application
within 45 days, or it shall be deemed to have approved the application.
(Prior Code, § 153.23) Penalty, see §
152.99
§ 152.40 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS ISSUED IN CASE OF EXTREME HARDSHIP.
   The Historic District Commission shall approve an application for a
certificate of appropriateness in any case where the owner would suffer extreme
hardship, not including loss of profit, unless the certificate of
appropriateness were issued promptly.
(Prior Code, § 153.24)
§ 152.41 APPEAL TO CIRCUIT COURT.
   Any applicant aggrieved by a determination of the Historic District
Commission may appeal to the Circuit Court.
(Prior Code, § 153.25)
§ 152.42 ORDINARY MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any exterior feature of a designated property that
does not involve a change in its design, material, or outer appearance. In any
case where the Building Inspector determines that there are emergency
conditions dangerous to life, health, or property involving a designated
property, the Building Inspector shall order the remedying of these conditions
without the approval of the HPC or the Historic District Commission. The
Building Inspector shall promptly notify the Chair of the Commission affected
by the emergency action.

PROCEDURE
§ 154.020 STANDARD.
   This chapter requires standard procedures for the processing of applications
for subdivision approval: pre-application procedure, procedure for conditional
approval of preliminary plat, and submission of final plat.
(Prior Code, § 151.020)
§ 154.021 PRE-APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Previous to the filing of an application for conditional approval of
the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall submit to the Planning Commission
plans and data as specified in §§
154.055 through
154.059. This step does not require formal application, fee, or filing of plat
with the Planning Commission. The purpose of the pre-application procedure is
to afford the subdivider an opportunity to avail himself or herself of the
advice and assistance of the Planning Commission, and to consult early and
informally with the Commission before preparation of the preliminary plat and
before formal application for its approval in order to save time and money, and
to make the most of his or her opportunities.
   (B)   Within 15 days after its meeting, the Planning Commission shall inform
the subdivider that the plans and data, as submitted or as modified, do or do
not meet the objectives of these regulations. When the Planning Commission
finds the plans and data do not meet the objectives of these regulations, it
shall express its reasons therefor.
(Prior Code, § 151.021)
§ 154.022 PROCEDURE FOR CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY TRACT.
   (A)   On reaching conclusions, informally as recommended in §
154.020, regarding his or her general program and objectives, the subdivider
shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plat, together with improvement plans
and other supplementary material as specified in §§
154.055 through
154.059.
   (B)   At least three copies of the preliminary plat, together with three
complete application forms for preliminary approval, shall be submitted to the
City Finance Officer two weeks prior to the Planning Commission meeting at
which consideration is desired.
      (1)   At the time of filing, a fee shall be paid to the City Finance
Officer to cover administrative costs.
      (2)   The City Finance Officer shall immediately notify the Secretary of
the Planning Commission upon receipt of a preliminary plat and distribute
copies of the plat and completed application forms to the City Planning
Commission.
      (3)   The City Finance Officer shall also publish notice of hearing to be
held at the next regular Planning Commission meeting. The City Planning
Commission will review the plat, attach any comments it has, and return it to
the Auditor within 14 days.
   (C)   The Planning Commission shall act on the preliminary plat within 45
days after submission of the plat to the City Finance Officer. If the Planning
Commission disapproves a plat, the reasons for disapproval shall be so stated
in the recommendation to the Common Council.
   (D)   If the Planning Commission acts favorably on a preliminary plat, a
notation to that effect shall be made on the plat by the presiding officer and
it shall be referred to the Common Council for action. The Common Council shall
approve or disapprove the plat within 30 days. Its action shall be noted on the
plat, signed by the Chairperson of the Common Council, and be returned to the
subdivider for compliance with final plat requirements.
   (E)   Conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall confer upon the
applicant the following rights for a one-year period from the date of approval:
      (1)   The general terms and conditions under which the preliminary
approval was granted will not be changed; and
      (2)   The said applicant may submit on or before the expiration date the
whole, or any portion of, said plat for final approval.
(Prior Code, § 151.022)
§ 154.023 SUBMISSION OF FINAL PLAT.
   (A)   Four copies of the final plat and four copies of the application form
for final approval shall be submitted to the Commission at least 14 days prior
to the date of a regular Planning Commission meeting. The Planning Commission
shall act upon the final plat within 45 days after the date of submission for
final approval. Unless the preliminary plat was approved without changes, the
final plat shall have incorporated all changes or modifications required by the
Common Council.
   (B)   Failure of the Planning Commission to act within this allotted time or
a mutually agreed upon extension shall be deemed to be a favorable
recommendation, and the plat shall be forwarded to the Common Council for its
action on the final plat.
   (C)   The final plat shall be approved or disapproved by the Common Council
within 30 days after submission by the Planning Commission, otherwise, such
plat shall be deemed to have been approved and a certificate to that effect
shall be issued by the Common Council on demand; provided, however, that the
applicant may consent to the extension of such period.
   (D)   Upon final approval, copies of the final plat shall be filed by the
Planning Commission with the following: City Finance Officer.
   (E)   The approved final plat shall be filed by the subdivider with the
County Recording Officer as provided in SDCL Chapter 11-3, and acts amendatory
thereto, and shall file satisfactory evidence of such recording in the office
of the County Auditor before the county shall recognize the plat as being in
full force and effect.

§ 154.036 SUITABILITY OF THE LAND FOR SUBDIVISION DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   If the Common Council finds that land proposed to be subdivided is
unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding, bad drainage, steep
slopes, rock formations, and other such conditions as may increase the danger
of health, life, or property, or aggravate erosion or flood hazards; and, if
from adequate investigations, conducted by all public agencies concerned, it
has been determined that in the best interest of the public, the land should
not be platted and developed for the purpose proposed, the Common Council shall
not approve the land for subdivision unless adequate methods are formulated by
the subdivider for meeting the problems that will be created by the subdivision
and development of the land.
   (B)   The Common Council may refuse to approve what it considers to be
scattered or premature subdivision of land which would necessitate an excessive
expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services, such as undue
maintenance costs for adequate roads.
(Prior Code, § 151.036)
§ 154.037 STREET EXTENSIONS.
   (A)   The arrangement, character, extent, location, and grade of all streets
shall be in accordance with the city comprehensive plan and shall be considered
in their relation to existing and planned streets, topographical conditions, to
public convenience and safety, and in appropriate relation to the proposed uses
of land to be served by such streets.
   (B)   Where, at the determination of the Common Council, it is desirable to
provide street access to adjoining properties, proposed streets shall be
extended by dedication to the boundaries of such properties. Where the Common
Council deems it necessary, such dead-end streets shall be provided with a
temporary turn-around having a radius of at least 50 feet.

adequate to ensure a sight distance of not less than 100 feet for minor and
collector streets, and of such greater radii as the Planning Commission shall
determine for special cases.

adjoining property is subdivided, the other half of the street shall be plated
within such tract.
   (I)   Cul-de-sacs, designed to be so permanently, shall not be longer than
600 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around having an

proposed.
   (B)   The minimum width of an alley shall be 20 feet.
   (C)   Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided,

streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith.
(Prior Code, § 151.040)
§ 154.041 BLOCKS.
   (A)   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due
regard to:
      (1)   Provisions of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs

(Prior Code, § 151.042)
§ 154.043 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   (A)   Generally. Where a proposed park, playground, school, or other public
use shown in the comprehensive plan is located in whole or in part in a
subdivision, the Planning Commission may require the reservation or option by
the appropriate public agency of purchasing such an area within the
subdivision, in those cases in which the Planning Commission deems such
requirements to be reasonable.
   (B)   Dedication of parks and recreational land for residential areas. Upon
the recommendation of the Planning Commission and approval by the Common
Council, and other consideration of the particular type of residential
development proposed, the subdivider shall be required to dedicate and deed to
the city such areas of a character, extent, and location suitable to the needs
created by such development for park and other recreational purposes. It is
hereby found and declared that at the time of platting it is reasonable to
require an amount of land equal to 5% of the land proposed to be subdivided for
parks and recreation purposes.
      (1)   As an alternative, if the land proposed for dedication does not
meet the needs of the area, the Common Council, after receiving a
recommendation from the Planning Commission, may require the subdivider to pay
in cash an amount equal to 5% of the fair market value of the UNDEVELOPED LAND,
as defined in this section, in lieu of the dedication of land.
      (2)   The fair market value shall be determined by the City Assessor’s
Office. For purposes of this section only, UNDEVELOPED LAND shall be defined as
bare, platted land after utilities, streets, and other normal improvements are
in place. The cash payment shall be used for the purchase of land or the
development of existing or future parks and playgrounds in the same general
area. When land is dedicated and deeded to the city for park purposes, it shall
be responsibility of the City Parks Department to maintain such dedicated
property.
   (C)   Dedication for storm water holding areas and ponds. Upon
recommendation of the Planning Commission and approval by the Common Council,
the subdivider may be required to dedicate to the public up to 5% of the land
proposed to be subdivided for storm water holding areas or ponds. The 5%
dedication shall not be considered in addition to the 5% dedicated for parks
and recreation purposes as it relates to residential subdivision.

constant intensity and color, or where any light bulb can shine directly into
the eyes of any occupant of any vehicle traveling upon any highway, driveway,
or parking area or into any window of any residence within 300 feet, or where
the illumination interferes with the visibility or readability of any traffic
sign or device, shall be permitted. This shall not be applied to prevent the
erection or maintenance of signs, which convey changing information, such as
time or temperature, by words, letters, or pictures represented by lights of
uniform color on a black background.
      (3)   No illuminated sign shall be permitted within 50 feet of property
in any Residential District unless the illumination of such sign is so designed
that it does not shine or reflect light onto such property.
      (4)   No billboard or advertising sign shall be erected to exceed 20 feet
above the ground level or 50 feet in length. The bottom coping of every ground
sign shall be at least three feet above the ground or street level.

setback from the established right-of-way line of any street or highway at
least as far as the required front yard depth for a principal use in such
district; and for every square foot by which such billboard exceeds 100 square
feet such setbacks shall be increased by one-half foot but not to exceed 300
feet.
      (7)   No advertising sign shall be located in any area designated by the
Common Council as one of scenic beauty or historical interest.
      (8)   No building walls shall be used for display of advertising, except
that pertaining to the use on the premises.
      (9)   Temporary signs may be erected or posted for a period not to exceed
60 days. Any sign posted for a longer period must meet the requirements for
permanent signs. No temporary sign shall exceed 150 square feet in area.

      (12)   Signs erected and overhanging any sidewalk must be placed at least
nine feet above the sidewalk and may extend over the sidewalk a distance equal
to two-thirds the width of the sidewalk, but in no case exceeding ten feet.
This regulation does not imply any authority to grant the use of the public
domain for private advertising.
      (13)   Pole signs shall be not over 30 square feet in area and shall be
located not closer than ten feet to any street right-of-way line and five feet
from any other property line.
      (14)   Professional signs for home occupations, where permitted, shall
not exceed three square feet in area, provided such sign is a wall sign
attached to the building.
      (15)   The area of a sign shall be determined by the smallest circle,
triangle, or rectangle that can be used to enclose the sign, exclusive of
supporting members that bear no message. A sign designed to be viewed from two
opposite directions shall be considered as one sign, provided that the two sign
faces shall not be more than two feet apart if parallel, nor form an angle of
more than 90 degrees if angular. Where more than one sign is permitted on a
lot, the net sign area shall be the sum of those signs designed to be viewed
from one direction, and such signs shall be not less than 20 feet apart.

(Prior Code, § 152.060)
§ 155.066 DRIVEWAYS.
   (A)   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definition shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      BOULEVARD. The portion of the public right-of-way which lies between the
curb and gutter, and the adjacent property line, or if no curb and gutter is
present, it is the portion of the public right-of-way which lies between the
edge of the paved street and the adjacent property line.
   (B)   It shall be the responsibility hereafter and required of all property
owners whose driveway connects to an existing paved street, paved alley, or
crosses over a public parkway to install a nonporous concrete or bituminous
driveway surface. The following are exceptions to this requirement:
      (1)   In locations where the existing street or alleyway providing access
to the property is unpaved, the driveway shall be surfaced with asphalt,
concrete, gravel, asphalt millings, or similar loose material.
      (2)   For property zoned Large Lot Single-Family or Agricultural, a paved
surface is only required when the existing street providing access to the
property is paved, in which case the paving of the driveway shall be required
to extend only to the front setback and with a minimum width of 12 feet. Beyond
the front setback, gravel, asphalt millings, or similar loose material is
permitted.
   (C)   It shall be the responsibility hereafter and required of all property
owners whose driveway crosses over any portion of any public sidewalk or public
parkway to provide the costs for all materials, construction, and installation
involved in surfacing the driveway with nonporous concrete or bituminous
material.
   (D)   Where a driveway of any kind of material is constructed across the
public sidewalk or public parkway, it shall conform to the sidewalk grades as
established and designated by the official grades of the sidewalks of the city
and the profiles on file in the office of the Public Works Supervisor.
   (E)   All driveways shall be so graded between the gutter and the sidewalk
that it will not be necessary to change the established grade of either, and
will not elevate or depress any portion of either. No part of such driveway
shall extend beyond the curb line in such manner as to change the grade of such
gutter or obstruct the free flow of water in such gutter. Where elevations or
depressions are necessary in the parkway strip adjoining the curb and walks,
the parkway shall be graded on both sides of the driveway to a distance
sufficient to create a gradual ascent or descent. Where driveways cross open
ditches in the parkways, adequate culverts shall be installed.
(Ord. 2022-04, passed 5-2-2022)
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 155.080 ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL.
   (A)   Duties of the administrative official. An administrative official,
hereafter known as the Building Inspector, designated by the Common Council,
shall administer and enforce this chapter. He or she may be provided with the
assistance of such other persons as the Common Council may deem necessary for
the successful enforcement of this chapter. Should the Building Inspector find
that any of the provisions of this chapter are being violated, he or she shall
notify, in writing, the party or parties responsible for such violations,
indicating the nature of the violation and ordering the action necessary to
correct the violation. He or she shall order discontinuance of illegal use of
land, removal of illegal buildings or structures or of illegal addition,
alterations, or structural changes, discontinuance of any illegal work being
done, or shall take any other action authorized by this chapter to ensure
compliance with, or to prevent violations of, its provisions.
   (B)   Building permits required.
      (1)   No building or other structure shall be erected, constructed,
enlarged, altered, improved, moved, or demolished without a permit therefor,
issued by the Building Inspector. Structures, which are less than 120 square
feet in area, may be permitted without a building permit and/or being placed on
a foundation.
      (2)   No building permit shall be issued by the Building Inspector except
in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, unless he or she receives a
written order from the Common Council in the form of an administrative review,
special exception, or variance as provided by this chapter. All applications
for building permits shall be as required in
Chapter 150 of this code.
   (C)   Construction and use to be as provided in application, plans, and
permit. Building permits issued on the basis of plans and applications approved
by the Building Inspector authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction
set forth in such approved plans and applications, any other use, arrangement,

this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 152.075)
§ 155.081 COMMON COUNCIL.

of the Planning Commission recommendation, the decision rendered by the
Planning Commission is considered final.
(Prior Code, § 152.076)
§ 155.082 VARIANCES.
   The purpose of the variance is to modify the strict application of the
specific requirements of this chapter in the case of exceptionally irregular,
narrow, shallow, or steep lots or other exceptional physical conditions,
whereby such strict application would result in practical difficulty or
unnecessary hardship which would deprive an owner of the reasonable use of his
or her land. The variance shall be used only where necessary to overcome some
obstacle, which is preventing an owner from using his or her lot as this
chapter intended.
   (A)   Requirements for the granting of a variance. Before the Common Council
shall have authority to grant a variance, the person applying for the variance
must demonstrate that:
      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be contrary to the public
interest;
      (2)   The literal enforcement of this chapter would result in unnecessary
hardship;
      (3)   By granting the variance contrary to the provisions of this
chapter, the spirit of this chapter will be observed; and
      (4)   The variance will not have the effect of allowing in any zoning
district uses prohibited in that zoning district, or of lowering standards
beyond that required by state law.
   (B)   Variance procedure.
      (1)   After written denial of a building permit from the Building
Inspector, a property owner may file a written request for a variance with the
Finance Officer.
      (2)   The request shall contain:
         (a)   The applicant’s name and address, and the names and addresses of
all adjoining landowners;
         (b)   A detailed description of the variance requested and the need
for the variance; and
         (c)   A narrative demonstrating that the requirements for granting
variances, as outlined in division (A) above, will be met if the variance is
granted.
      (3)   The applicant shall pay the City Finance Officer the appropriate
fee for a variance, as designated in §
150.006. These fees shall be utilized to help defray administrative costs of
processing the application. Additional costs are required for mailings, which
are the applicant’s responsibility.
      (4)   The application will then be given to the Planning Commission for
consideration and a recommendation will be given to the Common Council.
      (5)   Upon recommendation from the Planning Commission, the Common
Council shall schedule a hearing and shall give ten days’ notice of such
hearing by publication in a legally designated paper. The applicant shall
notify all adjoining landowners by certified letter at least five days prior to
any public hearing.
      (6)   The Common Council shall render a decision on the request for a
variance within 15 days following the public hearing. The decision to grant a
variance must be approved by three-fourths of the full membership of the Common
Council.

Commission or Common Council may require. A list of property owners maybe
obtained from the Finance Officer.
      (2)   The applicant shall pay the City Finance Officer the appropriate
fee for a use on review, as designated in §
150.006. These fees shall be utilized to help defray administrative costs of
processing the application. Additional costs are required for mailings, which
are the applicant’s responsibility.
   (B)   Authorization for the use on review. The application will be given to
the Planning Commission for its review and recommendation. The Planning
Commission shall be given 60 days in which to study the effect of such proposed
use upon the character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, public
utilities, and other matters pertaining to the public health, safety, and
general welfare. No such use on review shall be approved until and unless the
recommendation of the Planning Commission has been filed.
   (C)   Public hearing. After the Planning Commission has made its
recommendation, the Common Council shall schedule a hearing and shall give ten
days’ notice of such hearing by publication in a legally designated paper. The
applicant shall notify all property owners by certified letter within 200 feet
at least five days prior to the public hearing of the pending application for
the use on review and the hearing date. The Common Council may then vote to
approve or deny the use on review.
   (D)   Restrictions. In the exercise of its approval, the Common Council may
impose such conditions regarding the location, character, or other features of
the proposed use or building, as it may deem advisable in the furtherance of
the general purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Issuance of permit. Upon completion of the necessary application and
approval of the Common Council, the Building Inspector shall issue the building
permit subject to all applicable rules, regulations, and conditions. All
approved plans, conditions, restrictions, and rules made part of the approval
shall constitute certification on the part of the applicant that the proposed
use shall conform to such regulations at all times.
   (F)   Time limit and notification. All applications for uses permitted on
review shall be decided within 60 days of the date of application, and the
applicant shall be provided with either a written notice of approval or denial.
