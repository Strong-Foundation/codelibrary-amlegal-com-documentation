§ 32.23 POLICE SERVICES AT PARTIES.
   (A)   Findings and purpose. The governing body of the City of Vermillion
finds and declares that:
      (1)   The control of a party, gathering, or event on private property
becomes necessary when such activity threatens the peace, health, safety or
general welfare of the public and the same is hereby declared to be a public
nuisance.
      (2)   When a party, gathering, or event threatens the peace, health,
safety and general welfare of the public, police officers are required to make
calls and occasionally return calls to the location of the party, gathering or
event in order to restore peace, health, safety or general welfare of the
public, investigate violation of state laws and city ordinance and regulations,
issue citations or make arrests, and/or disperse participants.
      (3)   The calls and return calls of police officers to such a party,
gathering or event constitutes a drain of manpower and resources, often leaving
other areas of the city without police protection. Police officers may be
required to respond from off-duty status or extend work duty shifts due to
these calls.
      (4)   The above conditions create expense and pecuniary damage to the
city and a significant hazard to the safety of the police officers and to the
public in general. When such pecuniary damage results, the public, taxpayers
and city become victims of the person or persons responsible for the party,
gathering or event.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      PARTY, GATHERING, OR EVENT. A group of persons who have assembled or are
assembling for a social occasion or for a social activity.
      PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EVENT. The person:
         (a)   Who owns the property where the party, gathering or event takes
place;
         (b)   Who is in charge of the premises; and/or
         (c)   Who organized the event.
      POLICE SERVICES. Includes the wages of police officers for the amount of
time consumed responding from (a) off-duty status or (b) on-duty status if work
duty shift extension results and that time is attributable to responding to or
remaining at the party, gathering, or event. Wage rate or overtime rate will be
that established by the governing body of the City of Vermillion, fringe
benefit costs, the actual costs of any medical treatment to injured officers,
and the costs of repairing any damaged city equipment or property.
   (C)   Police services at parties, gatherings or events. When a party,
gathering, or event occurs on a private property and a police officer at the
scene determines that there is a threat to the public peace, health, safety or
general welfare, the person or persons responsible for the event may be held
jointly and severally liable for the costs of police services and if a person
responsible for the event is a minor, then the parents or guardians of that
minor will be jointly and severally liable for the costs of police services.
   (D)   Noise probation. 
      (1)   When a party, gathering, or event has occurred on private property
and a police officer has determined that there is noise ordinance violation
occurring at the premises, a police officer may issue and serve upon the person
or persons responsible a “Notice of Noise Probation” in substantially the
following form: “You are hereby notified that this premises (describing it) has
been placed on noise probation. Please be advised that any further complaints
of excessive noise or disturbances at this premises within a period of 6 months
from the date hereof may result in arrest, fines or recovery of costs of police
services necessary in responding to the complaint or all of these consequences.
Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated.”
      (2)   If within a period of 6 months thereafter another incident of like
kind and nature does occur at that premises requiring police services, the
person or persons responsible may be subject to citation, arrest, fines or
liability for damage in an amount equal to the costs of police services or
both.
   (E)   Record of police services. The Chief of Police is directed to prepare
and maintain a record of the costs of police services rendered within the scope
of this section and promptly to present the record to the Clerk of Courts for
imposition as restitution per SDCL Ch. 23A-28 and further appropriate action.
   (F)   Debt created. The costs of police services rendered within the scope
of this section and for the purposes therein mentioned are hereby declared to
be a debt against the person or persons responsible for the party, gathering or
event, as well as the property where it occurred, and may be recovered as
restitution in an ordinance violation proceeding or other action by the city
against such persons or property, including §
90.20 nuisance abatement cost assessment procedures.

(Ord. 1377, passed 6-18-2018)
§ 32.49 SPECIFIC DISCRIMINATORY OR UNFAIR PRACTICES.
   (A)   For an employer, because of race, color, sex, creed, religion,
ancestry, national origin, familial status, disability, marital status,
military or veteran status, gender identity, or sexual orientation, to fail or
refuse to hire, to discharge an employee, or to accord adverse, unlawful, or
unequal treatment to any person or employee with respect to application,
hiring, training, apprenticeship, tenure, promotion, upgrading, compensation,
layoff, discharge, or any term or condition of employment;
   (B)   For an employment agency, because of race, color, sex, creed,
religion, ancestry, national origin, familial status, disability, marital
status, military or veteran status, gender identity, or sexual orientation, to
accord adverse, unlawful, or unequal treatment to any person in connection with
any application for employment, any referral, or any request for assistance in
procurement of employees, or to accept any listing of employment on that basis;
   (C)   For any labor organization, because of race, color, sex, creed,
religion, ancestry, national origin, familial status, disability, marital
status, military or veteran status, gender identity, or sexual orientation, to
deny full and equal membership rights to an applicant for membership or to a
member; to expel, suspend, or otherwise discipline a member; or to accord
adverse, unlawful, or unequal treatment to any person with respect to his or
her hiring, apprenticeship, training, tenure, compensation, upgrading, layoff,
or any term or condition of employment;
   (D)   Owner of rights to housing or real property, or any person acting for
an owner, with or without compensation, including any person licensed as a real
estate broker or salesman, attorney, auctioneer, agent, or representative by
power of attorney or appointment, or to any person acting under court order,
trust, or will, because of race, color, sex, creed, religion, ancestry,
national origin, familial status, disability, marital status, military or
veteran status, gender identity, or sexual orientation, to fail or refuse to
sell, rent, assign, or otherwise transfer any real property to any other
person, or to accord adverse, unlawful, or unequal treatment to any person with
respect to the acquisition, occupancy, use, and enjoyment of any real property.
The provisions of this section do not apply to rooms or units in dwellings that
contain living quarters for no more than 2 families living independently of
each other, if the owner maintains and occupies 1 of the living quarters as his
or her residence.
      (1)   For the purposes of determining discrimination based on familial
status, a family shall be interpreted as 1 or more individuals under the age of
18 who are domiciled with their parent, legal custodian, or person granted
custody with permission of the parent or custodian. This definition includes a
person who is pregnant or in the process of securing custody of a person under
the age of 18. Discrimination based on familial status applies to housing
accommodations only.
      (2)   The provisions of this section as they refer to familial status do
not apply to residences publicized as specifically designated for older or
disabled residents if:
         (a)   A state or federal program has designated the residence for the
elderly;
         (b)   The residences are intended for, and solely occupied by, persons
62 years of age or older; or
         (c)   Facilities and services for the residence are designed to meet
the needs of the elderly, and at least 80% of the units are occupied, or
intended to be occupied, by 1 or more persons 55 years of age or older.
      (3)   It is an unfair or discriminatory practice to design or construct
for first occupancy any multi-family dwelling with more than 4 units for sale,
rent, lease, assignment, sublease, or transfer that does not enable
accessibility to ground floor common areas and usability of ground floor
housing units by disabled persons or by wheelchairs. If the building has
elevators, all housing units and common areas shall be usable by disabled
persons and persons in wheelchairs. The accommodations may include widened
doors, lowered electrical switches and outlets, lowered environmental controls,
grab bars or reinforcements, and/or kitchens and bathrooms usable by the
disabled. Nothing in this provision may be construed to require prior approval
of plans for construction by the Commission.
      (4)   It is also discriminatory to refuse to permit, at the expense of
the disabled person, reasonable modifications of existing property that may be
necessary to afford full enjoyment of the property. The landlord may, where it
is reasonable to do so, condition permission for re-modification on the
renter's agreeing to restore the premises to the condition that existed prior
to the modification at the conclusion of renter's tenancy, reasonable wear and
tear excepted.
   (E)   For any person engaged in the provision of public accommodations,
because of race, color, sex, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin,
familial status, disability, marital status, military or veteran status, gender
identity, or sexual orientation, to fail or refuse to provide to any person
access to the use of and benefit from the services and facilities of those
public accommodations; or to accord adverse, unlawful, or unequal treatment to
any person with respect to the availability of the services and facilities, the
price or other consideration therefor, the scope and quality thereof, or the
terms and conditions under which such are made available, including terms and
conditions relating to credit, payment, warranties, delivery, installation, and
repair;
   (F)   For any person engaged in the provision of public services, because of
race, color, sex, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, familial status,
disability, marital status, military or veteran status, gender identity, or
sexual orientation, to fail or refuse to provide to any person access to the
use and benefit thereof, or the terms and conditions under which such are made
available;
   (G)   For any person, because of race, color, sex, creed, religion,
ancestry, national origin, familial status, disability, marital status,
military or veteran status, gender identity, or sexual orientation, directly or
indirectly, to conceal any unlawful discrimination; to aid, abet, compel,
coerce, incite, or induce another person to discriminate; to, by any means,
trick, mislead, advertise, or sign, any person to use any form of application,
make any record or inquiry, or use any device or artifice whatsoever to bring
about or facilitate discrimination; or to engage in, or threaten to engage in,
any reprisal, economic or otherwise, against any person because of the latter's
filing a charge, testifying, or assisting in the observance and support of the
purposes and provisions of this subchapter;
   (H)   For any person, bank, banking organization, mortgage company,
insurance company, or other financial institution or lender to whom application
is made for financial assistance for the purchase, lease, acquisition,
construction, rehabilitation, repair, or maintenance of any real property, or
any agent or employee thereof to discriminate against any person or group of
persons, because of the race, color, sex, creed, religion, ancestry, national
origin, familial status, disability, marital status, military or veteran
status, gender identity, or sexual orientation of the person or group of
persons, or of the prospective occupants or tenants of the real property, in
the granting, withholding, extending, modifying, renewing, or in the rates,
terms, conditions, and the extension of services, in connection therewith;
   (I)   Wherever religious organizations or bodies are exempt from any of the
provisions of this subchapter, the exemption shall apply only to religious
qualifications for employment or residence in church-owned or church-operated
property, and the organizations shall not be exempt from any provisions of this
subchapter relating to discrimination based upon race, color, sex, creed,
religion, ancestry, national origin, familial status, disability, marital
status, military or veteran status, gender identity, or sexual orientation;
   (J)   Nothing in this subchapter requires the following people to modify
property in any way, incur any additional expenses, or exercise a higher degree
of care for persons having a disability than for a person who does not have a
disability, nor does this subchapter relieve any person of any obligations
generally imposed on all persons, regardless of any disability, in a written
lease, rental agreement, or contract of purchase or sale, or to forbid
distinctions based on the inability to fulfill the terms and conditions,
including, but not limited to, financial obligations of the lease, agreement,
or contract:
      (1)   Employer;
      (2)   Provider of public accommodations;
      (3)   Provider of public services;
      (4)   Person selling, renting, or leasing real property;
      (5)   Person acting on behalf of any of the persons listed in divisions
(J)(1)-(4) above, with or without compensation, including but not limited to
any person licensed as a real estate broker or salesman, attorney, auctioneer,
agent, or representative by power of attorney or appointment; and
      (6)   Person acting under court order, trust, or will.
(Ord. 1377, passed 6-18-2018)
§ 32.50 SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL AUTHORITY AND DUTIES.
   The authority and duties of the Commission shall be to:
   (A)   Promote human and civil rights for all citizens and visitors of the
city;
   (B)   Promote a mutual understanding and respect among all racial,
religious, and nationality groups and work to discourage and, to the extent
permitted by this subchapter, prevent discriminatory practices against any such
group;
   (C)   Attempt to foster, through community effort or otherwise, goodwill,
cooperation, and equality;
   (D)   Study and determine the existence, character, causes, and extent of
discrimination in employment, housing accommodations, property rights,
education, public accommodations, and public services in the city, and
discrimination based on age, disability, marital status, military or veteran
status, familial status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, and gender
identity. The study and determination of discrimination is based on a broad
understanding of civil and human rights as embodied in the 1964 Civil Rights
Act as amended, which includes race, color, religion, gender, and country of
origin;
   (E)   Seek to prevent and eliminate stereotyping and discrimination because
of race, color, sex, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, familial
status, disability, marital status, military or veteran status, gender
identity, and sexual orientation by means of public information promotion,
alternative dispute resolution procedures, and referral, and to utilize all the
powers set forth in this subchapter to carry into execution the provisions of
this subchapter;
   (F)   Receive verified complaints alleging discrimination and conduct
inquiries as reasonably necessary to find the facts with respect thereto.
Inquiries can only be initiated upon the receipt of a verified complaint and
shall be limited to means, actions, and tactics which are not inconsistent with
the provisions of this subchapter, and to the allegations contained in the
verified complaint;
   (G)   Conduct public meetings, and gather and disseminate information to
governmental agencies and to the public;
   (H)   Utilize the records and services of municipal, state, and federal
governmental departments and agencies to the extent permitted by law and by the
provisions of this subchapter, and pursuant to agreement with departments and
agencies raise matters for preliminary inquiry and referral;
   (I)   Furnish to any appropriate state or federal agency having jurisdiction
in the premises a transcript of the findings in and about any case which the
Commission has investigated and a court of competent jurisdiction may inquire;
   (J)   Request the cooperation of various racial, religious, and ethnic
groups, community, civil, labor, and business organizations, student
organizations, fraternal and benevolent associations, veterans' organizations,
and other groups in informational campaigns and programs devoted to promoting
diversity celebration and emphasizing the need for eliminating group tensions,
prejudices, intolerance, bigotry, and unlawful discrimination;
   (K)   Cooperate with federal, state, and city agencies in developing
programs showing the contributions of the various groups to the culture and
traditions of our city and nation, the menace of prejudice, intolerance,
bigotry, stereotyping, and unlawful discrimination, and the need for mutual
respect;
   (L)   Advise the Mayor, City Council members, City Manager, and the
respective departments of the city concerning matters consistent with the
purposes and powers of the Commission;
   (M)   Recommend ordinances and other legislation pertinent to the purposes
of protection of human rights;
   (N)   Promote or conduct informational programs, and disseminate information
in furtherance of the purposes and policies of the Commission; and
   (O)   Hear and inquire into verified complaints alleging discrimination
regarding the city in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
subchapter. Pursuant to state law, there is presently no legal authority to
investigate verified complaints alleging discrimination because of marital
status, military or veteran status, gender identity, or sexual orientation.
Accordingly, until state law authorizes municipalities, pursuant to SDCL § 20-
12-4, to investigate discriminatory practices based on marital status, military
or veteran status, gender identity, or sexual orientation, these discriminating
practices cannot be investigated by the Commission. However, such acts may be
brought to the attention of the Commission by a complainant in the form of a
verified complaint, which is not inconsistent with the provisions outlined in §
32.51, for record and referral purposes. The Commission shall have no
regulatory enforcement powers which are inconsistent with the provisions of
this subchapter.

of completing and submitting a verified complaint form made available to the

locations to exterior locations easily accessible to meter readers; and viewing
dials or faces disclosing readings on interior water meters can conveniently be
installed so as to be readily accessible to meter readers.

         (e)   Liquid ammonia, paint, and fertilizer.
      (4)   The following described substances, materials, waters, or waste
shall be limited in discharges to municipal systems to concentrations or
quantities which will not harm either the sewers, waste water treatment
process, or equipment; will not have an adverse effect on the receiving stream;
or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, or public property, or constitute a
nuisance. The City Engineer may set limitations lower than the limitations
established in the regulations below if in his or her opinion the more severe
limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. In forming his or her
opinion as to the acceptability, the City Engineer will give consideration to
the factors as the quantity of subject waste in relation to flows and
velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, the waste
water treatment process employed, capacity of the waste water treatment plant,
degree of treatability of the waste in the waste water treatment plant, and
other pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions on materials or
characteristics of waste or waste waters discharged to the sanitary sewer which
shall not be violated without approval of the City Engineer are as follows:
         (a)   Waste water having a temperature higher than 150°F (65°C);
         (b)   Waste water containing more than 25 milligrams per liter of
petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oils, or product of mineral oil origin;
         (c)   Waste water from industrial plants containing floatable oils,
fat, or grease;
         (d)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded (see division
(A) above). Garbage grinders may be connected to sanitary sewers from homes,
hotels, institutions, restaurants, hospitals, catering establishments, or
similar places where garbage originates from the preparation of food in
kitchens for the purpose of consumption on the premises or when served by
caterers;
         (e)   Any waters or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc,
and similar objectionable or toxic substances to the degree that any such
material received in the composite waste water at the waste water treatment
works exceeds the limits established by the City Engineer for the materials;
         (f)   Any waters or wastes containing odor-producing substances
exceeding limits which may be established by the City Engineer;
         (g)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of the half-life or
concentration as may exceed limits established by the City Engineer in
compliance with applicable state or federal regulations;
         (h)   Quantities of flow, concentrations or both which constitute a
slug as defined herein;
         (i)   Water or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the waste water treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to the degree that the waste water treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters; and
         (j)   Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended
solids which interfere with the collection system, or create a condition
deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
      (5)   (a)   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in division (E)(4) above, and which in the
judgment of the City Engineer may have a deleterious effect upon the waste
water facilities, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise
create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the City Engineer may:
            1.   Reject the wastes;
            2.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge
to the public sewers;
            3.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge;
and/or
            4.   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and
treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the
provisions of division (E)(10) below.
         (b)   When considering the above alternative, the City Engineer shall
give consideration to the economic impact of each alternative on the
discharger. If the City Engineer permits the pretreatment of equalization of

monthly user service charge per 100 cubic foot units of waste water generated
computed by multiplying the incremental cost related to flow, BOD, TSS, and TKN
as determined in §
53.116, by the volume of water consumed in 100 cubic foot units, poundage of
BOD, poundage of TSS, and poundage of TKN respectively, for a 1-month period
which corresponds with the regular monthly billing period by the city, plus a
monthly administrative cost/fixed fee as determined in §
53.115.
         (c)   The waste water user service charge for any Class II user during
any billing period shall be computed using the meter reading obtained during
that same billing period.

   The city may review the total annual administrative and operation and
maintenance costs as well as the estimated waste water loads and number of
users on an annual basis to assure equity of the service charge system
established herein. If a Class II user has completed in-plan modifications
which would change that user's BOD and/or TSS and/or TKN contributions, the
user may make written application to the City Manager stating the circumstances
and requesting a different basis of charges for waste water service to their
premises. The City Manager is allowed to enter into an agreement with a user as
long as an understanding has been reached between the City Manager and the
user, otherwise, the City Manager will present to the Council and afford a
hearing to all interested parties and shall by resolution fix and establish
fair and equitable service charges for the premises if the normal charges are
found to be inequitable to the owner or occupant.

* Land included in the F-1 floodway zone shall have a runoff weighting factor
of 0 for the actual flood hazard area.
** Quarries are individually calculated with a runoff weighting factor of 0 for
the actual quarry area.
 
         (b)   Upon written request from a property owner, a detailed site
study will be conducted by the City Engineering Department to determine the
runoff weighting factor. This written request must be submitted to the City
Engineer on or before April 30, of the year the fees are charged to the subject
land parcel. The engineering department shall calculate the percentage of
impervious area for the subject parcel which contributes storm water runoff to
the drainage and system of the city. This system includes the storm sewer
system, drainageways, and all ditches and waterways within and flowing away
from the City of Vermillion. The runoff weighting factor is then determined
through utilization of Table II. This calculation shall be completed by July 1,
of the year the written appeal is requested.

NOTES TO TABLE:
** These values are derived from the “STORM” equation (Figure 5-20, Page 5-49),
A Statistical Method for tire Assessment of Urban Storm Drainage, EFIA,
Washington, D.C., January 1979. Fat-low percentage impervious surfaces (0% to
20%), a linear relationship was assumed between the “STORM” equation and
empirical data derived from drainage runoff in high depression storage, loose
soils, and flat areas.
 
         (c)   Interpolation of the runoff weighting factor for a given
percentage of impervious area not listed in Table II may be obtained by
assuming a linear relationship between the values listed.
         (d)   The City Engineer may direct that the runoff weighting factor
for, a given parcel Lie calculated by a detailed site investigation and Table
II, where an obvious departure from the percentage of impervious surfaces of
similar land uses exists.
         (e)   A determination of the runoff weighting factor, resulting from a
detailed site investigation and Table II, brought about either by written
request from a property owner or direction from the public utilities director,
shall be used in the calculation of the subject parcels storm drainage fee and
shall replace the factor previously derived from Table I, even if the resulting
value is higher.
      (2)   Parcel area. Parcel area is to be obtained from the records of the
Clay County Department of Equalization.
      (3)   Unit financial charge. The unit financial charge shall be as set by
resolution of the Vermillion City Council.
(1975 Code, § 25-127)
§ 53.136 COLLECTION.
   (A)   The storm drainage fee established in section §
53.135 shall be an annual charge. The first half of the fee is due on April 30,
and the second half is due on October 31, of the same year, payable at the
office of the County Treasurer of the county within which the land parcel lies.
   (B)   These fees shall be remitted or turned over to the Finance Officer of
the City of Vermillion, at least once a month, by the County Treasurer.
(1975 Code, § 25-128) (Ord. 999, passed 3-19-1993)
§ 53.137 FUND ESTABLISHED.
   The drainage fees paid to the city shall be kept in a separate fund to be
known as the Drainage and Storm Sewer Fund. This fund shall be used to pay the
cost of financing the operation, maintenance, or construction of the drainage
and storm sewer system.
(1975 Code, § 25-129)
§ 53.138 ANNUAL REVIEW.
   The unit financial charge shall be reviewed annually and shall be revised by
council resolution as necessary to keep revenues reasonably in balance with
anticipated expenditures. Excess funds may be carried forward from year to year
in order to build sufficient funds for large drainage construction projects
which are scheduled or programmed for the near future. In addition, funds may
be carried over to provide sufficient monies for unanticipated repairs,
replacements, or maintenance of the drainage system.
(1975 Code, § 25-130) (Ord. 992, passed 8-24-1992)
§ 53.999 PENALTY.

§ 112.20 SUITABLE APPLICANT.
   (A)   South Dakota Codified Law § 35-2-1.2 requires the City Council to
determine whether retail alcohol beverage license applicants or their
principals are suitable persons before issuing, transferring or renewing said
licenses. This determination is required annually for each license the
applicant seeks. In order to effectuate a thorough determination of suitable
applicant eligibility for license issuance, new applicants must submit to a
criminal background check to determine suitability. Each new applicant shall
make arrangements with a law enforcement agency and submit to the
fingerprinting process. The applicant must also provide to law enforcement
payment to the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation and FBI in an
amount necessary to cover the costs of the criminal record check. These actions
must be taken by an applicant prior to publication of hearing notice required
by South Dakota law. The applicant’s completed application will be attached to
the certification of the law enforcement agency when received.
   (B)   A DISQUALIFYING CRIMINAL RECORD for alcoholic beverage license
purposes means any conviction for any felony, a crime of violence as defined in
SDCL § 22-1-2(9), a sex offense as defined in SDCL § 22-24B-1, or trafficking
in controlled drugs or substances which when and where committed would
constitute such in the state of South Dakota. Unpardoned convictions of any
crime of moral turpitude as defined by SDCL § 22-1-2(25) which when and where
committed would constitute such in the state of South Dakota may constitute a
disqualifying record as determined by the City Council on a case-by-case basis.
Any criminal conviction not disclosed by an applicant on his or her application
form may be treated as a disqualifying record. Any criminal conviction may be
considered in making license issuance decision. Suspended imposition of
sentence will not be considered a conviction.
   (C)   An applicant subject to this policy shall provide to the law
enforcement agency performing the fingerprinting process cash, check, or money
order in an amount necessary to cover the costs of fingerprints for the
criminal record check.
   (D)   An applicant or principal in any business entity that is an applicant
having any indebtedness to the city must satisfy said indebtedness before the
City Council will consider any application for alcoholic beverage license
issuance or renewal, except for plan one or two special assessment obligations
that are not in arrears.

§ 112.21 SUITABLE LOCATION.
   (A)   South Dakota Codified Laws § 35-2-1.2 requires the City Council to
determine whether retail alcohol beverage license applications propose suitable
locations before issuing or renewing said licenses. This determination is
required annually for each license the applicant seeks. The following are
nonexclusive criteria established to assist in determining suitable location
status:
      (1)   Identification of a garbage hauler to be utilized by the business
and the frequency of the garbage pickup;
      (2)   Zoning restrictions, and
      (3)   Neighborhood characteristics.
   (B)   In determining suitable location, the City Council will also utilize
factors developed through South Dakota case law. This includes the manner in
which the business is operated; the extent to which minors frequent or are
employed in such place of business; the adequacy of police facilities to
properly police the proposed location, and other factors associated with the
sale of alcoholic beverages, such as noise and litter.

10.99
§ 112.22 SUITABLE APPLICANT AND SUITABLE LOCATION CONSIDERATION.
   (A)   South Dakota codified laws and case law support the premise that the
decision to issue an alcoholic beverage license is discretionary. Therefore,
the city hereby establishes a two-tiered process to evaluate on-sale liquor
applications. The first tier will assess the suitability of the applicant or
principals and whether the location is suitable according to §§
112.20 and
112.21 of this chapter.
   (B)   Upon finding evidence that the suitability of the applicant and
location, the City Council will consider second tier criteria. This process can
include examining the best location for economic and tourism development, the
best ancillary uses (restaurant, etc.) developed with the sale of liquor, the
best location in accordance with the city long-range plan, the size of the
facility, parking facilities, closeness to existing supplementing businesses,
residences, and activities deemed important by the City Council.

license shall provide sufficient documentation to the city with an application
form provided by the city to demonstrate that the primary source of revenue
from the operation of the restaurant will be derived from the sale of prepared

The supporting documentation concerning the primary source of revenue submitted
pursuant to this section is confidential.
      (2)   The applicant will need to comply with all applicable ordinances
for issuance of a license including §§
112.20 through
112.22 with the application.
   (C)   Annual reports. With the renewal application, a full-service

months of operation or since issuance of the license for the first year
whichever is less and supporting documentation to the city on forms provided by

established shall be a minimum of $1 for each person residing within the city
as measured by the last preceding decennial federal census.
      (2)   The license fee shall be initially established by resolution within
90 days of the initial adoption of this section. Subsequent changes in the
license fee shall not be made for a period of 10 years from December 4, 2008,

         (a)   Within 90 days after December 4, 2008 and as required by state
statute, each licensee within the city who owns an on-sale license issued
pursuant to SDCL 35-4-2(4) or (6) as of January 1, 2008, and who purchased the

the on-sale license to the City of Vermillion Finance Department on forms
provided by the city. Any form submitted pursuant to this provision shall be
signed under oath and shall include the documents establishing the amount
originally paid for the on-sale license. If the transaction for the purchase of
the on-sale license included real or personal property, the full market value
of the real or personal property on the date of the original sale shall be
deducted from the total transaction price to determine the amount paid by the
licensee for the on-sale license. The burden of establishing the amount paid
for the license shall be on the licensee. Any licensee contesting the fair
market value of the real or personal property may appeal the valuation adopted
by the city to Circuit Court.
         (b)   For purposes of this section, the term CURRENT FAIR MARKET VALUE
means the documented price of the on-sale license most recently sold between
January 1, 2003 and January 1, 2008, through an arm’s length transaction, less
the value of any real or personal property included within the transaction.

maintain a registry of each full-service on-sale restaurant license that is
being offered for sale and the city shall furnish a copy of the registry to
anyone who requests a new full-service restaurant on-sale license. The existing
full-service restaurant on-sale licensee is responsible for registering in
writing annually with the city that the full- service restaurant on-sale
license is for sale. Requests to be removed from the registry shall be in
writing.
   (I)   Issuance of new full-service restaurant licenses restricted. The city

the registry provides documentation showing that the person is unable to
purchase the on-sale license at the price established in division (G) above and
on terms satisfactory to both the potential buyer and seller. The price of any
on-sale license registered as “for sale”with the city shall be sold at the
current fair market price set by the city pursuant to a resolution adopted in
accordance with division (G)(2) above.

exterior doors and windows, and roof coverings.
   (B)   No building, with an area of 120 square feet or more, shall be moved
until a permit has been obtained as provided in this chapter. The Building
Official shall not issue the permit if, in the Building Official’s judgment,
the proposed new location of the structure would seriously increase the fire
hazard of the surrounding buildings, or if moving the building or structure
will, or probably will, likely result in unreasonable damage to streets, trees,
or other property along the route over which the building or structure is
proposed to be moved.
   (C)   No permit to move a residential structure to a new location within the
city shall be granted unless the full and true property tax assessment value of
the structure at its original location is at least 85% of the average full and
true property tax assessment values of the residential structures within 200
feet of any part of the premises upon which the structure shall be located at
its future proposed site within the city. If the structure does not meet the
value requirement, a variance may be granted within the city if at least 85% of
the owners of residential property within 200 feet of the structure at its
future proposed site, excluding property owned by the applicant, sign a
petition favoring the variance. The city may require an appraisal to determine
the full and true value of the structure to be moved if it is not located
within Clay County.

alley or sidewalk is hereby declared a public nuisance pursuant to SDCL Ch. 21-
10 and may be abated by the city according to law.
   (E)   Whenever the person, firm, or corporation moving a structure upon, or
along any street or alley, shall willfully, or negligently, permit such
structure, while in transit, to remain upon the street, alley or sidewalk, the
city shall have the authority, and is authorized, to move said building from
the street, alley, or sidewalk to any point or place in the city where the same
shall not obstruct travel or cause inconvenience to the public. The city shall
keep an account of the expense of such removal, and the person, firm, or
corporation and the sureties of the bond filed, as required by the provisions
of this chapter, shall be liable to the city for such expense and the same may
be recovered by civil action.
   (F)   A permit to move a building or structure shall not be granted if:
      (1)   The building is too large to move without endangering persons or
property in the city or the weight of the building or structure may cause
damage to the roadway;
      (2)   In the opinion of the Building Official, the building or structure
is in such a state of deterioration or disrepair or is otherwise so
structurally unsafe that it cannot be moved without potentially endangering
persons or property in the city;
      (3)   The applicant’s, or house/building mover’s, equipment is unsafe and
persons and property may be endangered by its use;
      (4)   The location where the building or structure would be moved would

location, use and occupancy; or
      (5)   The building or structure to be moved would be in violation of any
of the provisions of the Building Code relating to, but not limited to,

§ 150.39 BUILDING AND DEVELOPMENT IN FLOOD PLAIN.
   (A)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this section to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in floodplains;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
      (7)   Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a
flood area.
   (B)   Abrogation and greater restriction. This section is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this section and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (C)   Severability. If any provision, or portion of this section is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court, the remainder of the section shall not
be affected.
   (D)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions
greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by man-
made or natural causes. This section does not imply that land outside the areas
of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This section shall not create liability on the part
of the city corporate community entity or any official or employee thereof for
any flood damages that result from reliance on this section or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (E)   Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used
in this section shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give this section its most reasonable application.
      (1)   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the flood plain within a
community subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The

storage of equipment or materials.
      (6)   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home
park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the
lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a
minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either
final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the
effective date of the floodplain management regulations.

            3.   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by
flooding as defined in division (a)2. of this definition and are akin to a
river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as
when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the
current.
         (b)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or
other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or
currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by
an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a
severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding as defined in division (a)1. of this definition.

which the City Manager or designee has delineated both the special hazard areas
and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
      (10)   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY OR FLOOD ELEVATION STUDY. An examination,
evaluation and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate,
corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and
determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards.
      (11)   FLOOD PROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate

      (15)   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, however,
that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of
the applicable non-elevation design requirements of division (G) of this
section.
      (16)   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in 1 or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The
term MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle.

parcels) of land divided into 2 or more manufactured home lots for rent or
sale.
      (18)   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For the purposes of determining insurance rates,
structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the
effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is
later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
floodplain management purposes, new construction means structures for which the
start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
      (19)   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home
park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the
lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum,
the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final

M, or E.
      (24)   START OF CONSTRUCTION. (For other than new construction or
substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-
348)), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit
was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a

or
         (c)   A travel trailer without wheels built on a chassis and affixed
to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community’s floodplain
management and building ordinances or laws. For the latter purpose, STRUCTURE
does not mean a recreational vehicle or a park trailer or other similar
vehicle, or a gas or liquid storage tank.
      (26)   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it’s before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the assessed county director of equalization value
of the structure before the damage occurred.
      (27)   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the assessed county director of equalization value of the
structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term
includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the
actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by a code enforcement official and which are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
         (b)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.
      (28)   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with the city’s flood plain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in division (G) of this section is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
   (F)   Generally. The City Engineer or designee is hereby appointed the
Floodplain Administrator to implement the provisions of this chapter and other
appropriate sections of the NFIP Regulations and 44 CFR pertaining to

   (I)   Variance procedures.
      (1)   The Board of Appeals shall hear and render judgment on requests for
variances from the requirements of division (G) of this section.
      (2)   The Board of Appeals shall hear and render judgment on an appeal
only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the City Manager or designee or Building Official in the
enforcement or administration of division (G) of this section.
      (3)   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Board of
Appeals may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
      (4)   The City Manager or designee or Building Official shall maintain a
record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency and the State Office of Emergency
Management upon issuing a variance.
      (5)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of ½ acre or less in size contiguous to and
surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood
level, providing the relevant factors in division (I)(9) below have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the ½ acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (6)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of
this section, the Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting
of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of
this section.
      (7)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (8)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (9)   Prerequisites for granting variances:
         (a)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         (b)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
            2.   Determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
            3.   Determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
            4.   Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (10)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that:
         (a)   The criteria outlined in division (I)(l) through (I)(9) above
are met; and
         (b)   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.
   (J)   Penalty and violation. No structure or land shall hereafter be
constructed, developed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full
compliance with the terms of division (G) of this section and other applicable
regulations. Any person who violates division (G) of this section or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall be subject to a penalty in accordance
with §
10.99 of the City of Vermillion Code of Ordinances.

information by providing that:
      (1)   Businesses and services may identify themselves;
      (2)   Customers and other persons may locate a business or service;
      (3)   No person or group is arbitrarily denied the use of the sight line
from public rights-of-way for communication purposes.

to enhance the appearance and economic value of the landscape by providing that
signs:
      (1)   Do not create a nuisance to persons using the public rights-of-way;
      (2)   Do not constitute a nuisance to occupancy of adjacent and
contiguous property by their brightness, size, height or movement.

§ 152.12 COMPUTATION OF AREA AND HEIGHT.
   The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign
height:
   (A)   Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face
(which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only 1 face)
shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle,
or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing,
representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color
forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is
placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative
fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance
regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
   (B)   Computation of area of multifaced signs. The sign area for a sign with
more than 1 face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign
faces visible from any 1 point. When 2 identical sign faces are placed back to
back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and
when the sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than
42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of 1 of the
faces.
   (C)   Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the
distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest
attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower
of:
      (1)   The existing grade prior to construction.
      (2)   The newly established grade after construction.
(Ord. 1188, passed 6-16-2008 ; Am. Ord. 1195, passed 9-15-2008)
§ 152.13 TABLES.
   (A)   (1)   Signs shall be allowed on private property in accordance with
Table 1. If the letters “NP” appear for a sign type in a column, such sign is
allowed without prior permit approval in the zoning districts represented by
that column. If the letters “PR” appear for a sign type in a column, such sign
is allowed only with prior permit approval in the zoning districts represented
by that column. Special conditions may apply in some cases. If the letters “NA”
appear for a sign type in a column, a sign is not
allowed in the zoning districts represented by that column under any
circumstances. Any sign designated by “NP” or “PR” shall be allowed only if it
conforms to all other applicable requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   When regulating signs within the Joint Jurisdiction area, the
zoning districts of the Joint Jurisdiction Zoning Area shall correspond to the
zoning districts of the city as follows:

§ 154.02 GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING PLATS AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS; URBAN.
   (A)   Requirement. Plats will be required whenever any subdivision of land
is proposed, before any contract is made for the transfer of any part thereof,
and before any permit for the erection of any structure in such proposed
subdivision shall be granted, the developer, owner or an authorized agent shall
apply for and secure approval of such proposed subdivision plat in accordance
with the procedures set forth.
   (B)   Recording, use and selling.
      (1)   No owner or agent of the owner of any land located within a

and recorded in the manner prescribed herein.
      (2)   No local agency shall issue any permit or grant any approval
necessary to develop any real property which has been divided, or which has
resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of this title. The
authority to deny such a permit shall apply whether the applicant was the owner
of record at the time of such violation or whether the applicant is the current
owner of record or a vendee of the former owner pursuant to a sale with or
without actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of
acquisition of an interest in said real property.
      (3)   No local agency shall issue any permit or grant any approval
necessary to construct any structures, or ancillary structures, within a

of Appeal in the instance that a minor plat is disapproved by the City
Engineer.
      (2)   Major plat. Plats containing any number of lots, but there is no
existing right-of-way; typically contain 6 or more lots. Major plats require a
preliminary and final plat prior to approval by the City Council. Both plats

only approve the final plat.
      (3)   Replat. May contain any number of lots. If the replat contains less
than 5 lots, and all lots front an existing right-of-way and the area to be
platted is 3 acres or less, then the approval process is the same as for the
minor plat; otherwise, procedures for the major plat will be followed.

shall show the general layout of streets/roads, street improvements, parks,
trails, open spaces, sewerage, water systems, and any other utilities. A
conceptual storm drainage study shall also be submitted as per the storm
drainage design criteria or as required by the City Engineer. The conceptual
plan shall be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer prior to the
development being allowed to continue.
      (5)   Preliminary plans. As with conceptual plans, preliminary plans will
be required of all major plats. This requirement may be waived for minor plats
or replats. The preliminary plan shall consist of a general layout plan,
grading plan, drainage plan, utility plan and a ground water control plan.
These plans will be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer prior to the
development being allowed to continue.
      (6)   Final plans. Final plans will be required when a major plat is
filed with the city. This requirement may be waived for minor plats or replats.
The final plans shall consist of a general layout plan, grading plan, drainage
plan, street/road plan, utility plan, ground water control plan, typical cross
section sheets, construction detail sheets, road cross section sheets and
specifications. These plans will be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer

adequate water facilities (including fire hydrants) subject to the
specifications of the City Engineering Department.
   (C)   Water main extensions shall be approved by the City Engineering
Department. If the water main is extended adjacent to property that will not
participate in the initial construction cost of the water main, the developer
shall submit to the department a cost recovery study. The study shall be based
upon the actual construction costs showing the amount due from each property
when a connection is made to the extended water main. To facilitate the study,
the location of all fire hydrants, all water supply improvements, and the
boundary lines of proposed districts shall be shown on the preliminary water
and sewer plan.
   (D)   Land, which is located over or adjacent to a water bearing stratum or
water supply reservoir that is designated as an area providing or supplementing
the municipal water supply, shall remain undeveloped and unsubdivided unless
public water and sewer systems are provided.

comprehensive plan, the developer shall install sewage systems in conformance
to the wastewater regulations of the State of South Dakota and all other local
applicable rules and regulations.
   (B)   In cases where a connection to an existing public sanitary sewer may
not be immediately practical, a connection may be made to a gravity sewer
system by the use of a lift station constructed in accordance with the
regulations and requirements set forth by the City Engineering Department.
   (C)   All sanitary sewer facilities, including gravity sewers, manholes,
lift stations and force mains, shall be designed in accordance with standard
accepted engineering practices and are subject to the approval of the City

system of that structure.
   (B)   New construction with basements, or a usable crawl space, shall have a
drain tile placed around the inside or outside perimeter of the foundation
connected to a sump pit. All baseboard seepage collection systems shall be
discharged to the sump pit. The sump pit shall be located at least 10 feet away
from the inside sanitary floor drain.
   (C)   Buildings with existing sump pumps or drain lines shall construct a
discharge line. The line shall be installed to the outside wall of the building
with rigid plastic pipe. The discharge pipe must have a check valve within 1
foot of the floor grade and union or other approved coupling for easy
disconnection for repair or replacement. The discharge line shall extend at
least 3 feet outside of the foundation wall, and no closer than 5 feet from any
sidewalk.
   (D)   Alternate method of installation. The discharge pipe may be connected
directly to the public storm sewer system provided the discharge is at a higher
elevation than the normal flow level and that an approved backflow prevention
device is installed. A permit is required for the construction of a discharge
pipe which is connected directly to the storm sewer system.
   (E)   At no point shall the discharge line discharge 10 feet from an
adjacent property. No discharge shall be directed so as to impact neighboring
properties.
   (F)   Discharging into the street, alley or over the sidewalk will not be
allowed during the months of November through March of the year.
   (G)   Curb cuts for discharge lines will only be allowed in situations where
there is no public storm sewer system within 100 feet of the property. The
discharge line shall be placed under the sidewalk and through the back of the
curb. If a storm sewer system is constructed at a later date the owner shall be
required to connect to new sewer during construction or within a year. The cost
for connecting to storm sewer will be borne by the property owner.

§ 154.18 GENERAL PROVISIONS AND ASSURANCES; URBAN.
   (A)   Conformity with other plans and ordinances. All subdivision plans and
plats shall comply with the following additional laws, ordinances and
regulations:
      (1)   The comprehensive plan of the city and the policies set forth
therein.
      (2)   The zoning regulations of the city.
      (3)   The major street plan.
      (4)   SDCL § 11-3-12.1. Approval of access to street or highway
prerequisite to filing plat.
      (5)   Other plans which may be or have been adopted that would affect the
subdivision and use of land, such as those contained in SDCL Ch. 11-3 and 11-6.
   (B)   Interpretation, abrogation and severability. In interpreting and
applying the provisions of this chapter, these regulations are the minimum
requirements for the promotion of public safety, health and general welfare. It
is not the intent of this chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easement, covenant or deed restriction. Where these provisions conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (C)   Amendments. For the purpose of providing for the health, safety and
general welfare of the community, the City Council may from time to time amend
the provisions imposed by these subdivision regulations in the manner
prescribed by law.
   (D)   Variances.
      (1)   The City Council may reduce or otherwise vary the requirements of
these regulations whenever it encounters a situation described below. In
granting such variances, the City Council may require whatever conditions
deemed necessary to secure the basic objectives of the particular regulations.
The variances and waiver may be granted by the vote of ¾ of the City Council.
Any variance granted by the City Council shall be noted in its official
minutes.
      (2)   Unwarranted hardship. Whenever the City Council finds that
unwarranted hardships or particular difficulties may result from strict
compliance with these regulations, it may, after written application by the
developer, grant variances to the regulations subject to specified conditions
so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured. Such
variances shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of
these regulations or the comprehensive plan. The City Council shall not grant
variances to these regulations unless it makes findings based upon the evidence
presented in each specific case on the following criteria:
         (a)   Because of unusual surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property, a particular hardship to the owner would
result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the
regulations were adhered to.
         (b)   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based
are unique to the property and are not applicable, generally, to other property
and have not been created by any person having an interest in the property.
         (c)   The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a
desire for financial gain.
         (d)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public’s health, safety or welfare or injurious to property or improvements in
the neighborhood in which the property is located.
      (3)   Large scale residential developments. The standards and
requirements of these regulations may be modified by the City Council in the
case of a plan for a new residential neighborhood which, in the judgment of the
City Council, complies with the objectives of the comprehensive plan and city
zoning regulations.
      (4)   Design innovations. From time to time subdivisions may be designed
to provide unusual amenities and at the same time fail to conform strictly to
the provisions of these regulations. The City Council may waive certain
requirements of these regulations in approving subdivisions involving detailed
and workable design innovations that would yield an enhanced living environment
for future occupants.
   (E)   Development agreements. No plat, plats of any subdivision, or building
permits shall be approved unless the street, sidewalks, water lines, sanitary
sewer lines, storm sewer lines, alleys, streetlights, or any other public
improvement required by this chapter have been constructed along the property’s
frontage prior to such approval or unless the developer shall have signed a
developer agreement to establish the responsibility for the construction of
such improvements in a satisfactory manner as specified by the City Engineering
Department and the City Council. A developer agreement shall also be required
if the construction of multiple apartment units will be constructed in a phased
approach. The agreement will require that any drainage infrastructure is
constructed prior to the construction of the second building, or the start of
the second phase, whichever is first. The developer agreement shall be recorded
with the register of deeds at the time of the filing of the plat.

Exceptions:
   #1   A side yard of 20 feet shall be required where a lot is adjacent to or
abuts a residential district.
   #2   A rear yard of 25 feet shall be required where a lot is adjacent to or
abuts a residential district.
   #3   There shall be a required front yard on each street side of lots.
   #4   Wastewater treatment facilities are exempt from minimum yard or
setback requirements.
   #5   See also adjustments to yard regulations (§
155.082 for other specific exceptions).
 
   (D)   Performance standards. All conditional uses within this section shall
meet the following performance standards prior to consideration by the Planning
and Zoning Commission:
      (1)   Appearance. Junk, salvage, auto wrecking, and similar operations
shall be shielded from view from streets and from adjacent properties in
another district by means of a sturdy, sight-obscuring fence in good repair.
      (2)   Fire hazard. All flammable substances involved in any activity
established in this district shall be handled in conformance with the standards
of the National Board of Fire Underwriters, National Fire Protection
Association, and any additional regulations of the city.
      (3)   Noise. All noise and noise-causing activities shall be muffled so
that they will not create a disturbance greater than normal peak-hour traffic
noise on a major street when observed from any area zoned residential. Major
street noise for comparison purposes shall be measured on the primary state
highway nearest to the industry.
      (4)   Sewage and liquid waste. No operation shall be carried on which
involves the discharge into a sewer, water course or the ground of liquid
wastes of any radioactive nature, or liquid waste of a chemical nature which
are detrimental to normal sewage plant operation or corrosive and damaging to
sewer pipes and installations. Any liquid wastes which create heavy loading on
the city treatment plant will be subject to treatment by the owner, before
being discharged into the city sewer system or by other agreement with the City
Council.
      (5)   Air contaminants.
         (a)   Air contaminants and smoke shall be less dark than designated
number 2 on the Ringleman Chart as published by the United States Bureau of
Mines, except that smoke of a density designated as number 2 shall be permitted
for one 4-minute period in each one-half hour. Light-colored contaminants of
such opacity as to obscure an observer's view to a degree equal to or greater
than the aforesaid shall not be permitted. Particulate matter or dust as
measured at the point of emission by any generally accepted method shall not be
emitted in excess of two-tenths grains per cubic foot as corrected to a
temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit.
         (b)   Due to the fact that the possibilities of air contaminants
cannot be comprehensively covered in this section, there shall be applied the
general rule that there shall not be discharged from any source whatsoever such
quantities of air contaminants or other material in such quantity as to cause
injury, detriment, nuisance or annoyance to any considerable number of persons
or the public in general or to endanger the comfort, repose, health or safety
of any such considerable number of persons or the general public or to cause or
have a natural tendency to cause injury or damage to business, vegetation or
property.
      (6)   Odor. Odor-causing operations shall be controlled to reduce the
escape of odors to the minimum practical within the limits of technology and
economics.
      (7)   Gases. All noxious gases shall be controlled to the extent that
they will not be injurious to life and property. The gases sulfur dioxide and
hydrogen sulfide shall not exceed 5 parts per million, carbon monoxide shall
not exceed 25 parts per million, and nitrous fumes shall not exceed 5 parts per
million. All measurements shall be made at the zoning lot line.
      (8)   Vibration. All machines including punch presses and stamping
machines shall be mounted so as to minimize vibration. Vibration shall not be
so excessive that it interferes with industrial operations on nearby zoning
lots.

PD PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
§ 155.050 INTENT; COMPLIANCE WITH COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.
   (A)   It is the intent of this district to provide flexibility from
conventional zoning regulations with increased public review for planned
development district projects in order to:
      (1)   Encourage well-planned, efficient urban development.
      (2)   Allow a planned and coordinated mix of land uses which are
compatible and are harmonious, but previously discouraged by conventional
zoning procedures.
      (3)   Encourage more creative, higher quality and more ecologically
sensitive urban design with special consideration given to projects which
incorporate desirable design features, including but not limited to underground
parking, orientation or design to take advantage of solar energy, environmental
preservation, historic preservation, handicapped accessible structures, unique
use of open spaces or other desirable design features.
      (4)   Improve communication and cooperation among the city, land
developers, and interested residents in the urbanization of new lands and the
renewal of existing deteriorated areas.
   (B)   The developments within the planned development district shall comply
with the policies and design standards of the Vermillion Comprehensive Plan.
The development shall be mutually compatible with adjacent projected
developments.
   (C)   The planned development district that is being presented to the
Planning and Zoning Commission, and to the City Council, shall be at least 3.5-
acres in area. The size of the district may vary once the initial development
plan is approved by the City Council.
(Ord. 1189, passed 7-7-2008; Am. Ord. 1409, passed 12-2-2019)
§ 155.051 PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Initial development plan.
      (1)   When a petitioner wants to request a rezoning to the Planned
Development District, it shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator,
showing the information specified in §
155.052, a minimum of 30 days prior to the Planning and Zoning Commission
meeting at which consideration is desired. After the planned development
request has been reviewed, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall make a
recommendation to the City Council on the requested rezoning. The City Council
shall then act to approve or deny the request.
      (2)   This request for rezoning is subject to the requirements for
amendment of the zoning regulations specified in §
155.101. No building permit shall be issued within the development until the
final development plan is approved and the plat is filed.
   (B)   Final development plan.
      (1)   Prior to construction on any lots in the planned development, the
petitioner shall present a final development plan showing the information
specified in §
155.053, to the Planning and Zoning Commission, who shall have the sole
authority to approve, deny, or amend the plan.
      (2)   The final development plan may be submitted in conjunction with the
initial development plan for concurrent approval on any subareas the developer
is ready to commit to a final plan. All the information required for both an
initial and final development plan must be shown for the area submitted for
concurrent approval, except that the developer may reference the requirements
of one of the traditional zoning districts as the development standard for a
particular subarea.
      (3)   Signs shall be posted on the property for a continuous period of 7
days immediately prior to any public hearing held by the Planning or Zoning
Commission or City Council to consider any final development plan. The signs
shall be furnished by the Zoning Administrator and posted by the applicant in
the numbers and locations prescribed by the Zoning Administrator.
      (4)   Before any action shall be taken by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, the applicant shall first file with the Zoning Administrator a
certificate verifying that the signs have been posted at the proper location
before the time specified by this section.
   (C)   Amendments.
      (1)   Major amendments. Major amendments to the initial and/or final
development plan shall be required to be approved with a public hearing in the
same manner as provided for in §
155.054.
      (2)   Minor amendments.
         (a)   Minor amendments to the initial and/or final development plan
shall be required to be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Notice
of the hearing shall be given by the posting of not less than 2 signs provided
by the Zoning Administrator. Before any action shall be taken by the Planning
and Zoning Commission, the applicant shall first file with the Zoning
Administrator a certificate verifying that the signs have been posted at the
proper location and for the time specified.
         (b)   Minor amendments to the initial development plan may also be
made by the submission and approval of a final development plan which is
changed from the approved initial development plan. Any amendments shall be
shown as a change from the initial development plan on the final development
plan, and further these changes shall be made on the initial development plan
on file with the County Register of Deeds.
      (3)   Minimal amendments. Minimal amendments to the final development
plan shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator on a reproducible
development plan showing the requested changes. The Zoning Administrator may
then approve the change in writing if he/she deems it appropriate.

§ 155.075 TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWER, ANTENNA SUPPORT STRUCTURES AND WIRELESS
COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.
   Regulations regarding development of telecommunications towers, antenna
structures and wireless communications facilities are intended to encourage the
development of a competitive wireless communications marketplace while
protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the public and maintaining the
aesthetic integrity of the community. The regulations cover the placement,
construction, and modification of telecommunications facilities.
Telecommunication towers owned by a governmental entity (e.g. city, county,
state, or federal government) and used for public safety purposes are exempt
from divisions (A) and (B). Additionally, at no point shall a government-owned
telecommunications tower's fall radius be closer than 33 feet from a
residentially zoned or used property.
   (A)   A minimum distance of 300 feet from the telecommunications tower to
any residentially zoned or used property measured from the base of the
telecommunications tower to the property line. Exceptions: The Planning and
Zoning Commission may grant an exception to the 300 feet distance from the
telecommunications tower, but not less than a distance of twice the fall radius
of the telecommunications tower, to any residentially zoned or used property
for stealth or camouflaged towers only if a public hearing is conducted by the
Planning and Zoning Commission wherein the design is approved. Notice of public
hearing to approve the design shall be sent to all property owners within 300
feet at least 10 days prior. Application for Planning and Zoning Commission to
consider an exception must be submitted at least 14 days prior to the hearing
and include pictures and information on the proposed design(s), maximum tower
height(s), and other information on the form provided by the city deemed
appropriate for consideration of the exception request.
   (B)   A minimum distance of ½-mile between telecommunications towers
measured from the base of 1 telecommunications tower to the base of another
except when an existing antenna support structure is used to co-locate a
wireless communication facility.
   (C)   Building permit shall include documented Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) approval prior to permit issuance.
   (D)   The maximum height for telecommunications towers and wireless
communications facilities shall not exceed 100 feet for single users or 200
feet for 2 or more users. When such structure is located in an airport approach
zone, Federal Aviation Administration approval will be required prior to permit
issuance. Wireless communications facilities on new telecommunications tower
structures, antenna support structures, or co-located on existing
telecommunications towers shall minimize visual impact on the city skyline.
   (E)   The tower shall be constructed in a manner that will make it
inaccessible for unauthorized person to climb.
   (F)   Telecommunications towers, antenna support structures and equipment
buildings shall be compatible with the architectural style of the surrounding
built environment, considering exterior materials, roof form, scale, mass,
color, texture and character. Equipment buildings may be located underground
where feasible. To prevent undue concentration of telecommunications towers,
consideration should be given to co-location as a first alternative.
   (G)   (1)   A telecommunications tower site and tower base adjacent to
residential property shall be provided with a fence, wall, berm or shrubbery of
sufficient height and of a character necessary to provide adequate visual
screening. Where the adjacent property is across public right-of-way from a
telecommunications tower site, screening shall be provided in all cases except
when the right-of-way is an arterial street.
      (2)   Existing vegetation and grades on the site shall be preserved as
much as possible. Natural growth around the property perimeter on large, wooded
lots may be considered a sufficient buffer to telecommunications towers. In
locations where the visual impact of the telecommunications tower would be
minimal, the screening requirement may be reduced or waived.
      (3)   Adjacent to a residentially used or zoned property, natural
materials shall be used for fence screening. If chain-link fencing is needed
for safety and security, additional landscape screening shall be required
outside the chain-link fence to screen public view of the telecommunications
tower site.

these regulations. The decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be
final unless an appeal is filed in accordance with §
155.095(F).

§ 155.100 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   (A)   Establishment. A Board of Adjustment is hereby established for the
City of Vermillion, which shall consist of the members of the City Council,
pursuant to SDCL § 11-4-24.
   (B)   Powers and duties. The Board of Adjustment shall have the following
powers and duties:
      (1)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in
any requirement or determination made by the Zoning Administrator in the
enforcement of this chapter; and
      (2)   To hear and decide upon petitions for variances to vary the strict
application of the height, area, setback, yard, parking or density requirements
as will not be contrary to the public interest. A variance shall not be allowed
to vary the use regulations.
   (C)   Appeal procedure.
      (1)   Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any
decision of the Zoning Administrator, may present to that official, a notice of
appeal, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part,
specifying the grounds of the illegality. The notice of appeal shall be filed
with the Zoning Administrator of the City of Vermillion, who shall transmit to
the Board of Adjustment all information and records concerning the appeal. Such
notice of appeal shall be presented to the Zoning Administrator within 30 days
after the filing of the decision in the office of the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment shall keep a public record of all findings
and decisions. All meetings shall be held at the call of the chairperson and at
such other times as necessary. Each session, at which an appeal is to be heard,
shall be a public meeting. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the appellant
by mail, and shall post notices of the public hearing at City Hall and on the
property affected by the proposed appeal (if applicable) no less than 7 days
prior to the scheduled public hearing. No less than 10 days before the public
hearing, the Zoning Administrator shall publish notice of the public hearing in
a legal newspaper of the city.
      (3)   A public hearing shall be held. The appellant may appear in person,
or by agent or attorney. Minutes of the public hearing shall be recorded and
kept in the records of the Board of Adjustment. Written findings certifying
compliance with the specific rules governing the action considered at the
public hearing shall be completed by the Board. The concurring vote of 2/3 of
the members of the Board of Adjustment shall be necessary to approve any appeal
or arrive at any determination.
   (D)   Variances. The Board of Adjustment shall have the jurisdiction to hear
and decide upon petitions for variances to vary the strict application of the
height, area, setback, yard, parking or density requirements as will not be
contrary to the public interest. For purposes of these regulations, public
interest shall include the interests of the public at large within the city,
not just neighboring property owners. At all times, the burden shall be on the
applicant to prove the need for a variance. The following issues are to be
considered, each and all of them, as determining factors in whether or not the
issuance of a variance is justified:
      (1)   An unnecessary hardship must be established by the applicant who
applies for the variance. For purposes of this subsection, an unnecessary
hardship is a situation where, in the absence of a variance, an owner can make
no feasible or reasonable use of the property. Convenience, loss of profit,
financial limitations, or self-imposed hardship shall not be considered as
grounds for approving a variance by the Board of Adjustment.
      (2)   Literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same district under the terms of this chapter.
      (3)   The variance requested is the minimum variance that will alleviate
the hardship.
      (4)   Granting of the variance will comply with the general purpose and
intent of this chapter, and will not be offensive to adjacent areas or to the
public welfare.
      (5)   No nonconforming use or structure in the same district and no
permitted or nonconforming use or structure in other districts shall be
considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
      (6)   Exceptional and extraordinary circumstances apply to the property
that do not apply to other properties in the same zone or vicinity and that
result from lot size or shape, topography or other circumstances which are not
of the applicant’s making.
      (7)   In order to preserve the intent of these zoning regulations and to
protect the public interest, the Board of Adjustment may attach conditions to a
variance. A variance shall remain valid only as long as the property owner
complies with any terms and conditions of the variance, as attached by the
Board of Adjustment.
      (8)   An application for a variance, available from the Zoning
Administrator of the City of Vermillion, shall be completed by the landowner
requesting the variance. Completed applications shall be returned to the Zoning
Administrator for review. To be considered completed, the application shall
contain the following information:
         (a)   Legal description of the land on which such variance is
requested, together with local street address;
         (b)   Name and address of each owner of the property;
         (c)   Name, address, phone number and signature of the applicant;
         (d)   Zoning district classification under which the property is
regulated at the time of such application;
         (e)   Description of the variance sought from the zoning regulations;
         (f)   Be accompanied with a site plan, unless waived by the Zoning
Administrator.
      (9)   The Zoning Administrator shall review the application, and shall
make a recommendation to the Board of Adjustment to either approve or not
approve said application. The Zoning Administrator’s recommendation shall
include a summary of the application, and the reasons and justification for
either approval or disapproval of the application. The Authorized Official or
the Board of Adjustment may refer requests for variances to the Vermillion
Planning and Zoning Commission for review and recommendation.
      (10)   The Zoning Administrator shall set the date, time and place for a
public hearing to be held by the Board of Adjustment. The Zoning Administrator
shall notify the landowner by mail, and shall post notices of the public
hearing at City Hall and on the property affected by the proposed variance no
less than 7 days prior to the scheduled public hearing. No less than 10 days
before the public hearing, the Zoning Administrator shall publish notice of the
public hearing in a legal newspaper of the city.
      (11)   The public hearing shall be held. The applicant may appear in
person, or by agent or attorney. Minutes of the public hearing shall be
recorded and kept in the records of the Board of Adjustment. Written findings
certifying compliance with the specific rules governing the action considered
at the public hearing shall be completed by the Board. The concurring vote of
2/3 of the members of the Board of Adjustment shall be necessary to approve any
variance or arrive at any determination.
   (E)   Court review. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Board of
Adjustment may petition a court of record within 30 days after the filing of
the Board’s decision as provided by SDCL § 11-4-25.

      (2)   All of the written consent forms shall be returned, dated and
signed, to the city no later than 180 days after change of zone application is
initially submitted. Extensions to the 180 days will not be given. If the 180
days expires, the applicant may request new forms from the Zoning
Administrator. These new forms will need to be completed within 180 days of

be required for any design which is materially different.
         (b)   Noise study. A noise study for the SCF if: (i) requested by the
Department; (ii) the proposed site is within 20 feet of a residential
structure; or (iii) the application proposes to utilize equipment which may
produce a persistent or chronic audible tone at such distance.
         (c)   Radio frequency (RF) emissions compliance. Whereas the FCC has
exclusive jurisdiction to establish radio frequency emission safety standards,
the Department may only require a written report or statement, signed and
sealed by a South Dakota licensed engineer or signed by a competent employee of
the applicant satisfactory to the city, which explains compliance with the RF
emissions limits established by the FCC.
         (d)   Utility pole or SCF support structure inspection. For
collocations or modifications to existing utility pole or SCF support
structure, applicant shall inspect the structure to which a proposed SCF would
be attached and determine, based on a structural engineering analysis by a

satisfactory to the city. A complete design justification must identify all
applicable design standards under this chapter and provide a factually detailed
reason why the proposed design either complies or cannot feasibly comply.
         (g)   Site plan. A site plan clearly indicating the location, type,
height and width of the proposed pole, on-site land uses and zoning, adjacent
land uses and zoning, distances to nearby objects, structures, and property
lines, adjacent roadways, proposed means of access, utility runs, and other
information which may uniquely impact the SCF's fitness for a particular site.
         (h)   Aesthetic compliance summary. An explanatory statement of
aesthetic considerations and requirements factored into applicant's design such
as stealthing, finishing, fencing, landscaping, or other elements which may
impact the visual appeal of the SCF unless photo simulation and design
documents are satisfactory to the city.
         (i)   A clear and complete written statement of purpose which shall
minimally include: (i) a description of the technical objective to be achieved;
and (ii) a to-scale map that identifies the proposed site location and the
targeted service area to be benefited by the proposed project.
   (E)   General standards.
      (1)   Utility pole design. An existing utility pole may be replaced or
extended to accommodate small cell facilities subject to the following
requirements:
         (a)   Replacement and new utility poles. Replacement utility poles
shall be substantially similar to the width, color, and material of the
original or adjacent utility poles. The Department may approve minor deviations
up to the minimum additional height needed to allow for the required clearance
from electrical wires to accommodate an antenna or antennas and may also
approve minor deviations up to 50% of the pole width at its base, not to exceed
30 inches, when housing equipment is placed within the pole base. Replacement
utility poles shall be located as close as possible to the existing utility
pole, and the replaced utility pole shall be removed. Replacement street lights
and poles shall conform to the adopted streetscape design standard for the
zoning district. New utility poles shall mimic the design of a replacement
utility pole that is most suitable for the proposed location.
         (b)   Replacement and existing utility pole height. The height of any
antennas at the top of a replacement or existing utility pole or any pole
extender, shall be no higher than the greater of either 50 feet or the height
of such utility pole or SCF support structure plus 10%.
         (c)   Equipment concealed. Whenever technically feasible, antennas,
cabling, and equipment shall be fully concealed within a pole, or otherwise
camouflaged to appear to be an integrated part of a pole.
         (d)   Flush-mounting and pole-top antennas. When technically feasible,
antennas will be flush-mounted on a pole, which means either: (i) mounted
directly to the pole with no gap other than that which may be required for
screws, bolts, or similar hardware; (ii) located at the top of the pole; or
(iii) side-mounted by mounted arm as needed for required clearance. Canisters
attached to the top of a pole shall not exceed the diameter of the pole, unless
technically required, and then shall not be more than 50% greater than the
diameter of the pole at the point of attachment or up to 16 inches in diameter,
whichever is greater. Exceptions may be permitted whenever the city and
applicant mutually agree on acceptable alternative designs.
         (e)   Antenna design. Each antenna shall be located in an enclosure of
no more than 3 cubic feet in volume, or in case of an antenna that has exposed
elements, the antenna and all of its exposed elements could fit within an
enclosure of no more than 3 cubic feet.
         (f)   No illumination. Small cell facilities shall not be illuminated
except for small status LEDs installed by the manufacturer. Such LEDs may not
be of a nature which is likely to distract a vehicle or pedestrian due to
brightness, size, blinking, other similar condition, or any combination
thereof.
         (g)   Generators and battery backup. Generators are not permitted for
small cell facilities. A battery backup may be permitted if it is concealed
consistent with the provisions of this chapter.
         (h)   Cabinet location and dimensions. Any equipment cabinet for a
small cell facility shall utilize the smallest cabinet enclosure that is
technically feasible to enclose the equipment. Disconnect switches may be
located outside of the primary equipment cabinet.
         (i)   Painting, coating, or finish material. The exterior of an SCF
shall be painted, coated, or be of a material which draws minimal attention
from an observer. For example, an SCF painted in blaze orange or safety green
is highly likely to draw attention and be distracting. An SCF finished with
polished aluminum is more likely to be distracting than an SCF finished with
matte grey paint.
      (2)   Ground-mounted equipment. To allow full use of the public right-of-
ways by pedestrians, bicyclists, and other users, all ground-mounted equipment,
excluding antennas, shall to the extent feasible be either: (i) undergrounded;
(ii) incorporated into street furniture; or (iii) concealed in the base of a
pole, and in all cases shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA), city construction standards, and any applicable state or federal
regulations in order to provide clear and safe passage within the public right-
of-ways. The location of any ground-mounted equipment shall also comply with
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), city construction standards, and any
applicable state or federal regulations in order to provide clear and safe
passage within the public right-of-ways.
      (3)   Building-mounted small cell facilities. Antennas may be mounted to
a building if the antennas do not interrupt the building's architectural theme.
         (a)   Balanced design. Small cell facilities attached to the side or
roof of buildings shall employ a symmetrical, balanced design for all facade-
mounted antennas. Subsequent deployments on a structure's exterior will be
required to ensure consistent design, architectural treatment and symmetry with
any existing small cell facilities on the same side of the structure.
         (b)   Architectural preservation. The interruption of architectural
lines or horizontal or vertical reveals is prohibited unless demonstrated to be
unavoidable.
         (c)   Complementary architecture. New architectural features, such as
columns, pilasters, corbels, or other ornamentation that conceal an antenna or
antennas, may be used only if the new feature complements the architecture of
the existing building.
         (d)   Mounting brackets. Small cell facilities shall utilize the
smallest mounting brackets necessary in order to provide the smallest offset
from the building.
         (e)   Concealment. Skirts or shrouds shall be utilized on the sides
and bottoms of antennas in order to conceal mounting hardware, create a cleaner
appearance, and minimize the visual impact of the antennas. Exposed conduit,
cabling and wiring is prohibited.
         (f)   Matching paint. Small cell facilities, and all visible mounting
hardware, shall be painted and textured to match adjacent building surfaces.
         (g)   Permission. All installations of a small cell facility shall
have permission from the utility pole or SCF support structure owner to install
the small cell facility on such utility pole or SCF support structure. Nothing
in this section affects the need for an applicant seeking to place a small cell
facility on a utility pole or SCF support structure that is not owned by the
city to obtain from the owner of the utility pole or SCF support structure any
necessary authority to place the small cell facility, nor shall any provision
of this section be deemed to affect the rates, terms, and conditions for access
to or placement of a small cell facility on a utility pole or SCF support
structure not owned by the city. This section does not affect any existing
agreement between the Department and an entity concerning the placement of
small cell facilities on any city-owned utility pole or SCF support structure.
      (4)   Preferred projecting or marquee sign. Small cell facilities
replicating a projecting or marquee sign must comply with the city's sign
regulations. All antennas shall be completely screened by the facade of the
sign. All cables and conduit to and from the sign shall be routed from within a
building wall. Cable coverings may be allowed on the exterior of the building
wall in limited circumstances and in situations where the coverings are
minimally visible and concealed to match the adjacent building surfaces.
      (5)   Parking lot lighting. Small cell facilities are permitted as
attachments to or replacements of existing parking lot light fixtures. The
design of the parking lot light fixture shall be in accordance with applicable
city construction standards, except that a pole extender up to 5 feet in height
may be utilized.
      (6)   Purely aesthetic standards. To the extent that a requirement is
purely aesthetic, an SCF applicant shall not be required to meet a more
burdensome standard than other users of the right-of-way. Other users of the
right-of-way shall meet the purely aesthetic standards of this chapter for new
or replacement deployments to the extent which is technically and economically
feasible.

obstruct or hinder the usual travel on or safety of the public right-of-way or
obstruct any legal use of the city's right-of-way or uses of the right-of-way
by utilities or other providers. If, in the reasonable determination of the
city, a small cell facility needs to be relocated for reasons of public health,
safety or welfare, or ROW maintenance or construction projects, then the small
cell facility shall be relocated at the permittee's expense. If the permittee
of the small cell facility fails to complete any relocation as required by the
city within 90 days of mailing of written notice, the city may commence and
complete the relocation and charge the permittee of the small cell facility for
the actual and reasonable costs of the relocation, including reasonable any
attorneys' fees and expenses.

operated for a continuous period of 12 months or is no longer authorized by a
small cell facility permit or other permit shall be considered abandoned, and
the permittee of such SCF, utility pole or other SCF support structure shall so
notify the city in writing and remove the same within 90 days of giving notice
to the city of such abandonment. Failure to remove an SCF, utility pole, or
other SCF support structure within said 90 days shall be grounds for the city
to remove the SCF, utility pole, or SCF support structure, at the permittee's
expense, including all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.
   (B)   If there are 2 or more users of a single utility pole or SCF support

cease using the utility pole or SCF support structure.
(Ord. 1402, passed 7-1-2019)
§ 157.09 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION.
   In addition to and distinct from the insurance requirements of this chapter,
each applicant hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the city
and its officers, officials, boards, commissions, employees, agents and
representatives from and against any and all damages, losses, claims and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of suit or defense,
arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or result from the
acts, omissions, failure to act or misconduct of applicant or its affiliates in
the construction, installation, operation, maintenance, repair, removal or
replacement of the SCF. This chapter shall not require the applicant to
indemnify or hold harmless the city for any losses, claims, damages, and
expenses arising out of or resulting from the sole negligence or willful
misconduct of the city.
(Ord. 1402, passed 7-1-2019)
§ 157.10 APPEAL PROCESS.
   If a permit is denied in the administrative review process, then applicant
may appeal that decision to the Planning and Zoning Commission for further
consideration. If that same permit or a request for a permit is denied by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, then applicant may appeal that decision to the
City Council for further consideration. Such reviews must be completed within
the review period set forth in § 157.05(B). Nothing in this section is intended
to require exhaustion of administrative remedies or otherwise prevent an
applicant from proceeding directly to court or to the Federal Communications
Commission following expiration of the § 157.05(B) time period.
(Ord. 1402, passed 7-1-2019)
§ 157.11 APPLICATION FEES, RATES AND LICENSE.
   (A)   Application fees. The fee for a permit for each SCF or SCF support
structure shall be established by resolution approved by the City Council.
   (B)   Recurring fees. A wireless provider authorized under this chapter to
place SCFs and any related utility pole or SCF support structure in the ROW
shall pay to the city a ROW access fee established by resolution adopted by the
City Council in an amount not to exceed the maximum fee permitted by applicable
federal law. Recurring fees shall be paid annually in accordance with the
city's standard billing or invoicing procedures.
   (C)   The application fee and the recurring fees under this section shall be
the sole compensation that the wireless provider shall be required to pay the
city. However, the rates of either the application fee or the recurring fees
may be increased due to extreme circumstances but in no case may such fees
exceed a reasonable approximation of the city's actual and reasonable costs. In
addition, such fees must be objectively reasonable, and no higher than charged
to similarly-situated competitors in similar situations.
   (D)   Each applicant shall enter into a lease/license agreement with the
city. The lease/license agreement defines term, license, termination, and SCF
removal provisions as well as any other terms and conditions that city and SCF
may mutually agree upon.
(Ord. 1402, passed 7-1-2019)
§ 157.12 SEVERABILITY.
   The various parts, sentences, paragraphs, sections and clauses of this
chapter are hereby declared to be severable. If any part, sentence, paragraph,
section or clause is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected
thereby.
(Ord. 1402, passed 7-1-2019)
§ 157.13 CONFLICT.
   Subject to the limitation set forth in §
157.03(B), these small cell facilities regulations are in addition to other

regulations, and provided the regulation is consistent with federal law, the
more restrictive provisions shall apply.
