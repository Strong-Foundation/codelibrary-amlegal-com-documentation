be required to unexpectedly remove, repair or replace private infrastructure or
appurtenances to private property, such as a private water service line, or to
remove a large tree rendered unsafe by storm or disease. Often, such a large

property for the purposes of maintaining public health and safety.
(Prior Code, § 2-150)
   (B)   Amounts. No loans shall be made for less than $500. Loans shall only
exceed $3,500 with the prior approval of the Common Council.
(Prior Code, § 2-151)

         (a)   The payback period in months;
         (b)   The interest rate of loans;
         (c)   A loan origination fee;
         (d)   The payment due date;
         (e)   The method of payment; and
         (f)   Any other terms the Finance Officer determines are reasonable
and necessary.
      (2)   The Finance Officer may establish categories of loans based on the
amount of the loan and the terms of the loan (such as the payback period in
months) may vary between categories. However, the terms of all loans within a
single category shall be uniform regardless of the borrower.
(Prior Code, § 2-152)
   (D)   Security. Loan amounts less than $1,250 shall be unsecured. Loan
amounts in excess of $1,250 shall be secured by a mortgage on the real property
where the work is performed, which mortgage shall be recorded in the office of
the County Register of Deeds. When the loan is paid in full, a satisfaction of
mortgage shall be recorded in the office of the County Register of Deeds. The
city shall prepare and record any such documents and will pay the costs of
recording.
(Prior Code, § 2-153)
   (E)   Record and delegation of authority. Loans issued shall be documented

§ 53.100 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter shall be to generate sufficient revenue to
pay all costs for the operation and maintenance of the complete wastewater
system. The costs shall be distributed to all users of the wastewater system in
proportion to each user’s contribution to the total loading of the treatment
works. Factors such as strength (BOD and SS), volume and delivery flow rate
characteristics shall be considered and included as the basis for the user’s
contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of operation and maintenance
costs to each user (or user class).
(Prior Code, § 18-186) (Ord. 512, passed 9-20-1982)
§ 53.101 DETERMINING TOTAL ANNUAL COST OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   The city shall determine the total annual costs of operation and maintenance
of the wastewater system which are necessary to maintain the capacity and
performance, during the service life of the treatment works, for which such
works were designed and constructed. The total annual cost of operation and
maintenance shall include, but need not be limited to, labor, repairs,
equipment replacement, maintenance, necessary modifications, power, sampling,
laboratory tests and a reasonable contingency fund.
(Prior Code, § 18-187) (Ord. 512, passed 9-20-1982)
§ 53.102 DETERMINING EACH USER’S WASTEWATER CONTRIBUTION PERCENTAGE.
   (A)   The city shall determine each user’s average daily volume of
wastewater, which has been discharged to the wastewater system, which shall
then be divided by the average daily volume of all wastewater discharged to the
wastewater system, to determine each user’s volume contribution percentage. The
amount used as the total average daily volume of wastewater shall exclude
infiltration and inflow. The city shall determine each user’s average daily
poundage of five-day 20°C biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) which has been
discharged to the wastewater system which shall then be divided by the average
daily poundage of all five-day BOD discharged to the wastewater system to
determine each user’s BOD contribution percentage.
   (B)   The city shall determine each user’s average suspended solids (SS)
poundage which has been discharged to the wastewater system which shall then be
divided by the average daily poundage of all suspended solids discharged to the
wastewater system, to determine the user’s suspended solids contribution
percentage. Each user’s volume contribution percentage, BOD contribution
percentage and suspended solids contribution percentage shall be multiplied by
the annual operation and maintenance costs for wastewater treatment of the
total volume flow, of the total five-day 20°C BOD and of the suspended solids,
respectively.
(Prior Code, § 18-188) (Ord. 512, passed 9-20-1982)
§ 53.103 DETERMINING A SURCHARGE SYSTEM FOR USERS WITH EXCESS BOD AND SS.
   The city will determine the average suspended solids (SS) and biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) daily loadings for the average residential user. The city
will assess a surcharge rate for all nonresidential users discharging wastes
with BOD and SS strengths greater than the average residential user. Such users
will be assessed a surcharge sufficient to cover the costs of treating such
users’ above normal strength wastes. Normal strength wastes are considered to
be 200 p.p.m. BOD and 250 p.p.m. SS. The surcharge rate structure for such
above normal strength waste dischargers is on file in the office of the Finance
Officer.
(Prior Code, § 18-189) (Ord. 512, passed 9-20-1982)
§ 53.104 DETERMINING EACH USER’S WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGE.
   Each nonresidential user’s wastewater treatment cost contributions as
determined in §§
53.102 and
53.103 shall be added together to determine such user’s annual wastewater
service charge. Residential users may be considered to be one class of user and
an equitable service charge may be determined for each user based upon an
estimate of the total wastewater contribution of this class of user. The Common
Council may classify industrial, commercial and other nonresidential
establishments as a residential user, provided that the wastes from these
establishments are equivalent to the wastes from the average residential user
with respect to volume, suspended solids and BOD. Each user’s wastewater
treatment cost contribution will be assessed in accordance with the rate
schedule on file in the office of the Finance Officer.
(Prior Code, § 18-190) (Ord. 512, passed 9-20-1982)

§ 53.106 PAYMENT OF USER’S WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGE AND PENALTIES.
   The city shall submit an annual statement to the user for the user’s annual
wastewater service charge or one-twelfth of the user’s annual wastewater
service charge may be included with the monthly water and/or wastewater utility
billing. The city may add a penalty of 1.5% per month if the payment is not
received by the city within 15 days. Should any user fail to pay the user
charge within three months of the due date, the city may stop the wastewater
service to the property.
(Prior Code, § 18-192) (Ord. 512, passed 9-20-1982)
§ 53.107 REVIEW OF EACH USER’S WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGE.
   The city shall review the total annual cost of operation and maintenance as
well as each user’s wastewater contribution percentage not less often than
every two years and will revise the system as necessary to assure equity of the
service charge system established herein and to assure that sufficient funds
are obtained to adequately operate and maintain the wastewater treatment works.
If a significant user, such as an industry, has completed in-plant
modifications which would change that user’s wastewater contribution
percentage, the user can present at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Common
Council, such factual information and the city shall then determine if the
user’s wastewater contribution percentage is to be changed. The city shall
notify the user of its findings as soon as possible.
(Prior Code, § 18-193) (Ord. 512, passed 9-20-1982)
§ 53.108 NOTIFICATION.
   Each user will be notified, at least annually, in conjunction with a regular
bill, of the rate and that portion of the user charges which are attributable
to wastewater treatment services.
(Prior Code, § 18-194) (Ord. 512, passed 9-20-1982)
§ 53.109 PROHIBITED WASTES.
   The discharge of any waters containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids or
gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other
wastes, to contaminate the sludge of any municipal systems or to injure or
interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or
to animals, create a public nuisance or create any hazard in or have an adverse
effect on the waters receiving any discharge from the treatment works is hereby
prohibited. Any user discharging any toxic pollutants which cause an increase
in the costs of managing the effluent or the sludge of the city’s treatment
works, shall pay for such increased costs.

RATES AND CHARGES
§ 53.125 SURCHARGE RATE STRUCTURE FOR ABOVE NORMAL STRENGTH WASTES.
   The city will determine the average total suspended solids (SS) and five-day
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) daily loadings for the average residential user
or in lieu of such a determination will consider the average residential
strength wastes to be 200 mg/l BOD and 250 mg/l SS. The city will assess a
surcharge rate for all nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD and SS
strengths greater than the average residential user. The surcharge will be
sufficient to cover the costs of treating such users’ above normal strength
wastes. Such users will pay an additional service charge of $0.10 per 1,000

issuance of $350,000 sewage disposal utility revenue bonds to finance the
city’s portion of the cost of such utility undertaking and has established on
the books of the city a Sewage Disposal Utility Fund, and various subfunds, for
administering all revenues of such utility undertaking. So long as any of the
sewage disposal utility revenue bonds, dated November 1, 1971, or any other
bonds made payable from such Sewage Disposal Utility Fund pursuant to such
resolution, remain outstanding, all rates and charges collected under this
subchapter for sewer services for deposit in the Sewer Rental Fund shall be
paid into the Sewage Disposal Utility Fund and accounted for as provided in
such resolution.

conviction thereof shall be fined in the amount not exceeding $100 for each
violation. Each day in which any such violation shall continue shall be deemed
a separate offense.
   (C)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall
become liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage occasioned the city
by reason of such violation.

unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other
vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent
crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway

may make a right turn, but shall first yield the right-of-way to pedestrians
and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection;
provided, that such right turn shall be permitted and effected unless a clearly
visible sign prohibiting such turn shall be erected at such intersection giving
notice thereof. The Chief of Police is hereby authorized and directed to cause

governing body may establish and designate.
      (4)   Steady red with green arrow.
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but only yield
the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
         (b)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless
he or she can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.

§ 118.05 ISSUANCE OF LICENSE.
   (A)   Once filed, the application will be referred to the appropriate city
departments for an investigation into the applicant’s eligibility for a

time.
   (C)   For applications received by the city after July 1, 2022, the

multiple applications that conform with ordinance requirements are received on
the same business day for a particular license, the city will choose the
successful applicant through a lottery.
   (D)   When a lottery is conducted, the applicants will be placed in a
lottery queue based on the order in which they were selected. If the applicant
selected first in the lottery is unable to comply with the terms of this

considered for the cannabis establishment license. The lottery queue will be
active for 24 months from the date the lottery was conducted, after which the

This new initial application will not be placed in any active lottery queue.
   (F)   If a conforming application is submitted but no licenses are
available, the application will be on file and active for 24 months from the
date it was submitted. If an applicable cannabis establishment license becomes
available while an application is active under this section, the applicant may
be considered for the cannabis establishment license without having to submit a
new initial application. After 24 months have elapsed since the application was
submitted, the application will expire. Upon the expiration of an application,
an applicant must submit a new initial application that conforms with all the
requirements in this chapter and state law to be considered for a cannabis
establishment license.
   (G)   Upon issuance of a license, the applicant shall pay a license fee as
set by resolution. The license will not be in effect until the applicant pays
the license fee in full. The license fee will not be prorated.

GRADING AND EROSION CONTROLS
§ 150.070 PURPOSE; APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion
by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water
quality and adversely affects aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable
species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers, ditches and the
dredging of lakes, ponds and streams. In addition, clearing and grading during
construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat.
   (B)   The purpose of this subchapter is to safeguard persons, protect
property and prevent damage to the environment in the city. This subchapter
will also promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating and controlling the
design, construction, use and maintenance of any development or other activity
that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land
in the city.
   (C)   Unless specifically exempted, these regulations apply to all lands
within the city in which the vegetative cover is removed; disturbed or fill
material has been brought onto the site requiring stabilization.

§ 150.072 GRADING PERMITS.
   (A)   Unless otherwise exempt, a grading permit will be required prior to
persons engaging in a land disturbing activity exceeding 1,000 square feet. The
following requirements must be met before the permit will be granted:
      (1)   General permit for stormwater discharges associated with
construction activities through SD DENR as required by state regulations for
land disturbing activity of one acre or more;
      (2)   General permit for stormwater discharges associated with industrial
activities through SD DENR as required by state regulations. The requirements
for this permit are governed by the Standard Industrial Code (SIC). There are
no size requirements for this permit; and
      (3)   Approval of the SWPPP by the City Public Works Department. The
SWPPP is a requirement for both divisions (A)(1) and (A)(2) above.
   (B)   A grading permit with a Grading and Erosion Control Plan (GECP) will
be required for persons wishing to engage in land disturbing activity of one-
half acre up to one acre upon obtaining approval of a GECP by the City Public
Works Department.
   (C)   The grading permit shall designate the name, address and phone number
for person(s) (including emergency contact information) responsible for erosion
control measure implementation and maintenance.
   (D)   No grading permit will be required for the following activities:
      (1)   Any emergency activity that is immediately needed for the
protection of life, property or natural resources;
      (2)   Any nursery and agricultural operations that is permitted by zoning
regulations as a main or accessory use; or
      (3)   Land disturbing activity of less than 1,000 square feet.
   (E)   All permits will remain active until permanent landscaping measures
have been met on the site. Permanent stabilization/re-vegetation must be met by
October 31 of the year following completion of the project or occupancy of the
project. Example: if the project is completed in July of 2011, then permanent
landscaping/re-vegetation must be complete by October 31, 2012. Projects larger
than one-half acre may be required to be stabilized, landscaped or re-vegetated
in phases to prevent long-term exposure of soils.
   (F)   Persons not subject to a grading permit but who are engaging in a land
disturbing activity are responsible for applying effective BMPs and will be
subject to the penalties set forth in §
150.999.
(Prior Code, § 6-103) (Ord. 1049, passed 2-20-2007; Ord. 1148, passed 11-21-
2011; Ord. 1298, passed 2-4-2019)
§ 150.073 GRADING AND EROSION CONTROL PLAN.
   For sites of one-half acre or larger, the grading and erosion control plan
must include:
   (A)   A legible map identifying area to be disturbed, slopes and resources
to be protected and also must include nearest downstream stormwater inlets,
drainage ways and neighboring property lines. This plan must be approved and
BMPs must be in place before any grading begins. The minimum map size for sites
one-half to one acre is eight and one-half inches by 11 inches; for
construction sites disturbing more than one acre and industrial sites, minimum
map size is 11 inches by 17 inches;
   (B)   The SWPPP for items in §
150.072(A)(1) and (A)(2) is required for submittal as the ESCP for this
section;
   (C)   All BMPs necessary to achieve soil stabilization on the site itself
and including stock piles of any soil, rock or any additional landscaping
materials on the site. The plan will also include a designated entry/exit
point, a concrete washout area on the site, measures to protect nearest
downstream stormwater inlet(s) and explain measures to prevent mud-tracking
from vehicles and equipment into the street; and
   (D)   Sites up to one-half acre which are not subject to a GECP will be
required to apply all BMPs necessary to accomplish soil stabilization based
upon the soil conditions and topography of the particular site. A GECP may be
required in these areas when sites are consistently noncompliant with this
code. Final stabilization requirements set forth in §
150.074 are required for these sites.
(Prior Code, § 6-104) (Ord. 1049, passed 2-20-2007; Ord. 1148, passed 11-21-
2011; Ord. 1298, passed 2-4-2019)
§ 150.074 FINAL STABILIZATION.
   (A)   All soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and
either of the two following criteria are met:
      (1)   Uniform (e.g., evenly distributed, without large bare areas)
perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70% of the native background
vegetative cover for the area has been established on all unpaved areas and
areas not covered by permanent structures; or
      (2)   Equivalent permanent stabilization measures (such as the use of
riprap, retaining walls or geotextiles) have been employed.
   (B)   When background native vegetation naturally covers less than 100% of
the ground, the 70% coverage criteria is adjusted as follows: 70% of the total
area covered by native vegetation must have total cover for final
stabilization. For example, if native vegetation covers 50% of the ground, 35%
would require total cover for final stabilization. In an area where limited
vegetation is naturally found, less stabilization will be required.
   (C)   For individual lots in residential construction, final stabilization
means that either:
      (1)   The property owner/contractor has completed final stabilization as
specified in division (A) above; or
      (2)   The property owner/contractor has established adequate temporary
stabilization including perimeter controls for an individual lot prior to
occupation of the property by the new property owner(s) and has informed the
property owner(s) of the need for, and benefits of, final stabilization. A
signed “Notice of Stabilization/ Re-Vegetation Agreement” form will acknowledge
the landscaping requirements of the new owner.
   (D)   For construction projects on land used for agricultural purposes
(e.g., pipelines across crop or range land, staging areas for road construction
and the like), final stabilization may be accomplished by returning the
disturbed land to its preconstruction agricultural use. Areas disturbed that
were not previously used for agricultural activities, such as buffer strips
immediately adjacent to a watercourse, and areas which are not being returned
to their preconstruction agricultural use must meet the final stabilization
criteria in divisions (A) or (B) above.
   (E)   Final stabilization must be completed on or before October 31 of the
year following the certificate of occupancy, final inspection or project
completion, whichever occurs sooner.
(Prior Code, § 6-105) (Ord. 1049, passed 2-20-2007; Ord. 1148, passed 11-21-
2011; Ord. 1298, passed 2-4-2019)
§ 150.075 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   It will be the responsibility of the grading permit holder to obtain
approval of all required agencies for any waterway crossings to be installed if
a wet watercourse will be crossed regularly during construction. (i.e., DENR,
Corps of Engineers, FEMA and the like)
   (B)   SWPPPs must be maintained on the site during the progress of the work.
   (C)   If control measures do not achieve stabilization, the permit holder
may be required to submit an updated SWPPP or may be required to submit a GECP
prepared by a professional engineer.
   (D)   Any on-site debris with potential to be wind-blown onto neighboring
properties must be controlled and refuse containers must be covered with a
cover intended for the container. Tarpaulins used to cover open dumpsters must
be intact and in good repair during use.
   (E)   The City Public Works Department may enter the site to make
inspections as needed.
(Prior Code, § 6-106) (Ord. 1049, passed 2-20-2007; Ord. 1148, passed 11-21-
2011; Ord. 1298, passed 2-4-2019)
§ 150.076 STOP WORK ORDER.
   (A)   Authority. Whenever the Public Works Administrator or designee finds a
site maintained contrary to the provisions of this subchapter, the Public Works
Administrator or designee is authorized to issue a stop work order for the
site.
   (B)   Issuance. The stop work order shall be in writing and issued to the
permittee or assigned contractor. Upon issuance the cited work shall
immediately cease. The stop work order shall state the reasons for the order
and the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume.
   (C)   Unlawful continuance. Any person who shall continue any work after
having been served a stop work order, with exception to work required by the
order, shall be subject to penalties set forth in §
10.99.

Penalty, see §
150.999
§ 150.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which no
specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §
10.99.
   (B)   The penalties for violation of §§
150.070 through
150.076 shall be as set forth in §
10.99. In addition, to protect public property and the public interest, the
city shall have the authority to clean, stabilize or re-vegetate its own
rights-of-way due to non-compliant permit holders. The city shall also have the
authority to assess the permit holder for the work performed, in addition to
all other remedies.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   (A)   The state legislature has in (statutes) SDCL § 9-29-1 and SDCL Ch. 9-
36 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the Common Council
does ordain as follows in division (B) below.
   (B)   The city elects to comply with the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Act of 1968 (Pub. Law No. 90-488, as amended). The National Flood
Insurance Program, established in the aforesaid act, provides that areas of the
town having a special flood hazard be identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and that floodplain management measures be applied in such
flood hazard areas. The National Flood Insurance Program was broadened and
modified with the passage of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 and
other legislative measures. It was further modified by the National Flood
Insurance Reform Act of 1994. The National Flood Insurance Program is
administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a component of the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
(Prior Code, § 8-1) (Ord. 1153, passed 3-19-2012)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city, and that area of the county
administered by the city pursuant to the terms of a joint powers agreement
between the city and the county, pursuant to Res. 2011-25, are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services and
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Prior Code, § 8-2) (Ord. 1153, passed 3-19-2012)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions to specific areas by the following provisions designed:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in floodplains;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   (G)   To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a
flood area; and
   (H)   To ensure that those who occupy the areas of a floodplain for their
actions.
(Prior Code, § 8-3) (Ord. 1153, passed 3-19-2012)
§ 151.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in erosion or in flood
heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
lands.
(Prior Code, § 8-4) (Ord. 1153, passed 3-19-2012)
§ 151.05 INTENT.
   (A)   The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was created by Congress to
reduce annual flood losses through careful planning by communities and to
provide property owners with affordable flood insurance. In 1976, the Common
Council requested voluntary participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program and adopted the “permanent” program in 1981.
   (B)   The city recognizes the inherent flood risk of Spearfish Creek and
other potential flood tributaries which flow through the city. It recognizes
the beneficial attributes of a National Flood Insurance Program, which protects
existing and future structures within the flood area and ensures against
potential financial loss and bodily harm. The city also recognizes the inherent
constraints imposed by the flood insurance program which prohibit certain uses
of property by its owners.
   (C)   The city, therefore, is adopting the new changes to the “permanent
program” with the following management objectives in mind as permitted by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency:
      (1)   Manage with a minimum intent of flood control regulations;
      (2)   Apply minimum regulations to variance authority; i.e., allow
construction within the floodplain fringe as long as it meets minimum
regulations of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and does not increase
the flood density or flood course;
      (3)   By legal authority elects not to control the 500-year flood area;
and
      (4)   Recognizes all architectural and engineering techniques approved by
FEMA, which provide for nondensity construction and floodproofing protection.
(Prior Code, § 8-5) (Ord. 1153, passed 3-19-2012)
§ 151.06 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Common Council’s interpretation of any
provisions of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   AREA OF FUTURE-CONDITIONS FLOOD HAZARD. The land area that would be
inundated by the 1%-annual-chance (100-year) flood based on future-conditions
hydrology.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may
be designated as Zone A on the FHBM. After detailed ratemaking has been
completed in preparation for publication of the flood insurance rate map, Zone
A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE,
AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO or V1-30, VE or V. For purposes of these regulations,
the term SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA is synonymous in meaning with the phrase
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% change of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The water surface elevation of the 1% annual
chance flood. The height in relation to mean sea level expected to be reached
by the waters of the base flood at pertinent points in the floodplains of
coastal and riverine areas.
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   BREAKAWAY WALL. A wall that is not part of the structural support of the
building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under
specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion
of the building or supporting foundation system.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). FEMA’s comment on a proposed
project that would, upon construction, affect the hydrologic or hydraulic
characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the
existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood elevations (BFEs), or
the special flood hazard area (SFHA). The letter does not revise an effective
NFIP map, it indicates whether the project, if built as proposed, would be
recognized by FEMA. FEMA charges a fee for processing a CLOMR to recover the
costs associated with the review. Building permits cannot be issued based on a
CLOMR, because a CLOMR does not change the NFIP map.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   EROSION. The process of the gradual wearing a way of land masses. This peril
is not per se covered under the program.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION. For the purpose of determining rates, structures for
which the “start of construction commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. EXISTING
CONSTRUCTION may also be referred to as EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the floodplain management regulations adopted by the city.
   EXISTING STRUCTURES. See EXISTING CONSTRUCTION.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal water; or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD ELEVATION DETERMINATION. A determination by the Administrator of the
water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the flood level that has a
1% or greater chance of occurrence in any given year.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). The official map on which FEMA has
delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones
applicable to the community.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. The official report provided by FEMA that includes
flood profiles, the flood boundary-floodway map and the water surface elevation
of the base flood.
   FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD-PRONE AREA. Any land area susceptible to being inundated
by water from any source (see definition of FLOODING).
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOODWAY (REGULATORY FLOODWAY). The channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the
base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more
than a designated height.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for purposes of floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for the
many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the
height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as
wave action, bridge openings and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the
watershed.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic reservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in

approved programs.
   IMPROVEMENT. Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
alteration of a structure, the cost of which does not equal or exceed 50% of
the market value of the structure.
   LOMA REQUESTS INVOLVING ONE OR MORE STRUCTURES. For a LOMA to be issued by
FEMA to remove one or more structures from the SFHA, the NFIP regulations
require that the lowest adjacent grade (the lowest ground touching the
structure) be at or above the BFE.
   LOMA REQUESTS INVOLVING ONE OR MORE LOTS. For a LOMA to be issued by FEMA to
remove one or more entire lots from the SFHA, the NFIP regulations require that
the lowest point on the lot(s) must be at or above the BFE.
   LOMR-F REQUESTS INVOLVING ONE OR MORE STRUCTURES. For a LOMR-F to be issued
by FEMA to remove the structure from the SFHA, the NFIP regulations require
that the lowest adjacent grade of the structure be at or above the BFE. The
participating community must also determine that the land and any existing or
proposed structures to be removed from the SFHA are “reasonably safe from
flooding.”
   LOMR-F REQUESTS INVOLVING ONE OR MORE LOTS. For a LOMR-F to be issued by
FEMA to remove the entire lot and structure, both the lowest point on the lot
and the lowest floor of the structure must be at or above the 1%-annual-chance
flood elevation.
   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). FEMA’s modification to an effective flood
insurance rate map (FIRM), or flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM), or both.
LOMR is generally based on the implementation of physical measures that affect
the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus
result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective
base flood elevations (BFEs), or the special flood hazard area (SFHA). The LOMR
officially revises the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) or flood boundary and
floodway map (FBFM) and sometimes the flood insurance study (FIS) report and,
when appropriate, includes a description of the modifications. The LOMR is
generally accompanied by an annotated copy of the affected portions of the
FIRM, FBFM or FIS report.
   LEVEE. A human-made structure usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM. A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees
and associated structures such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of 44 C.F.R. § 60.3.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MAP. The flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) or the flood insurance rate map
(FIRM) for a community issued by the agency.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL. For the purpose of the National Flood Insurance Program, the
National American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 datum, to which base flood
elevations shown on a community’s flood insurance rate map are referenced.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For the purposes of determining insurance rates,
structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the
effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is
later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
floodplain management purposes, NEW CONSTRUCTION means structures for which the
start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the city.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;

adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
designated height.
   RIVERINE. Relating to, formed by or resembling a river (including
tributaries), streams, brooks and the like.
   SPECIAL HAZARD AREA. An area having special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow),
or flood-related erosion hazards and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO,
A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, AH, VO, V1-30, VE, V,
M or E.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement or other improvement
was within 180 days of the permit date. The ACTUAL START means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading or filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers or foundations, or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part
of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions
of the building.
   STRUCTURE. For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building,
including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as
well as a manufactured home. Anything constructed or placed on the ground or
attached to the ground, including, but without limitations, buildings,
factories, sheds, walls, fences, culverts, conduits or any other human-made
objects.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
      (1)   Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement
of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of
the structure either:
         (a)   Before the improvement or repair is started; or
         (b)   If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before
the damage occurred. For the purpose of this definition, SUBSTANTIAL
IMPROVEMENT is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or
not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.
      (2)   The term does not however include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with
existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications, which
are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
         (b)   Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this
chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A
VARIANCE, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise
prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements, see 44 C.F.R. § 60.0.)
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications or
other evidence of compliance required in 44 C.F.R. § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas.

is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this chapter
and other appropriate sections of 44 C.F.R. (National Flood Insurance Program
Regulations) pertaining to floodplain management.
(Prior Code, § 8-31)
   (B)   Duties and responsibilities of Floodplain Administrator. The duties of
the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the
following.
      (1)   Permit review. The Floodplain Administrator shall:
         (a)   Review, approve or deny all applications for development permits
to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;
         (b)   Review all development permits to determine that all necessary
permits have been obtained from federal, state or local governmental agencies
(including § 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972,
33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is required;
         (c)   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that
the encroachment provisions of §
151.48(A) are met; and
         (d)   Review permit application to determine whether proposed building
site, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe
from flooding.
      (2)   Use of other base flood data. When base flood elevation data has
been provided in accordance with §
151.08, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from any federal,
state or other source as criteria for requiring that new construction,
substantial improvements or other development in Zone A are administered in
accordance with §
151.46.
      (3)   Information to be obtained and maintained. The Floodplain
Administrator shall:
         (a)   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially
improved structures and whether or not the structure contains a basement;
         (b)   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures:
            1.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean
sea level) to which the structure has been floodproofed; and
            2.   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in §
151.26(C).
         (c)   Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records
pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   Alteration of watercourses. The Floodplain Administrator shall:
         (a)   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities, the State
Office of Emergency Management and the State Coordinating Agency, which is the
Water Management Board, pursuant to SDCL § 46-1-6, prior to any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency; and
         (b)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.
      (5)   Interpretation of FIRM boundaries. The Floodplain Administrator
shall make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
151.29.
      (6)   No designated regulator floodway. When a regulatory floodway has
not been designated, the Floodplain Administrator must require that no new
construction, substantial improvements or other development (including fill)
shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community’s FIRM, unless it
is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point
within the community.
      (7)   Development. Under the provisions of 44 C.F.R. § 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain
development in Zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the community’s FIRM which increases the
water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot, provided that
the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA
(conditional letter of map revision).

§ 151.30 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base level, providing the provisions of §
151.29(D)(1) through (D)(11) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justifications required for
issuing the variance increases.
   (B)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section.
   (C)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (D)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (E)   Variances shall be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause; and
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
as identified in §

remain private shall be subject to approval as part of the overall development
plan.
   (E)   Process overview; applying the DRD zoning for the first time. In
traditional zoning districts, development standards are uniform and contained
within the zoning code. However, the development standards in DRD zoning are
unique and are fashioned and applied to the particular land being developed.
These development standards take the form of a concept plan and a final plan.
DRD zoning must always include an associated concept plan or final plan. There
are two ways to secure development approval with the DRD zoning. The applicant
may choose from two types of DRD review processes:
      (1)   Two-step approval; concept plan approval followed by final plan
approval at a later point in time. Typically, the two-step process is used when
a project includes any one of the following:
         (a)   More than one land use;
         (b)   More than one parcel developer;
         (c)   Moderate to high potential for change in the land uses and/or
reconfiguration of the concept plan before build out;
         (d)   Build-out takes place over a period of many years; or
         (e)   Exact locations of site improvements is unknown at the time DRD
is requested.
      (2)   One-step approval; final plan. If site development will commence in
one clearly defined time frame following zoning approval, only a final plan
approval is required at the time DRD zoning is requested. The final plan
contains all of the information required to effectuate a change of zoning, and
thus a separate concept plan is unnecessary. For one-step approvals, the final
plan will be evaluated using both the concept plan and final plan criteria.
   (F)   Concept plan. The concept plan depicts a general configuration and
description of proposed land uses, structures, lot sizes and street and
pedestrian networks. The concept plan is intended to be flexible and will
provide an overall framework within which specific development will take place
through the approval of the final plan.
      (1)   Concept plan submittal requirements. At the time of the initial
request to change zoning to DRD, or for a revision to a previously approved
concept plan, the following information must be included in the concept plan:
         (a)   Ownership and legal description of the property included in the
project and of adjoining properties;
         (b)   Significant topographical features, including, but not limited
to, watercourses, drainages, mountains and outcroppings, forested areas and
historical/archeological sites/structures listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Register of Historic Places;
         (c)   Approximate location, size, scale and use of all existing and
proposed land uses, structures, improvements and facilities to be constructed/
reconstructed;
         (d)   Schedule of minimum setbacks for each type of land use;
         (e)   Proposed areas to be designated as open space, landscape areas,
recreation areas or areas to be held in common ownership;
         (f)   A conceptual street plan showing projected locations for ingress
and egress and internal circulation patterns;
         (g)   Application form and rezoning fee according to the approved fee
schedule; and
         (h)   Such other conceptual information that is deemed appropriate by
the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Concept plan approval criteria. In consideration of a request for
concept plan approval, the Planning Commission and City Council shall take into
account factors including, but not limited to:
         (a)   Conformance with the goals and policies of the comprehensive
plan;
         (b)   Compatibility with and relationship to existing and potential
uses adjacent to the proposed project;
         (c)   Public safety issues relating to projected traffic generated by
the proposed uses and to the existing or potential transportation system of
adjoining properties;
         (d)   Community benefit of the proposed use(s);
         (e)   Aesthetic considerations related to the scope and size of the
proposed use(s);
         (f)   Adequacy of public services for the proposed use(s); and
         (g)   Testimony received from the public at the public hearing.
      (3)   Concept plan review process and public hearing notice requirements.
         (a)   Upon receipt of a complete application containing the required
information, the Zoning Administrator shall forward the concept plan for review
and comment to all city department heads, the City Historic Preservation
Commission and any applicable county, state and federal highway authority if
the parcel receives access not within the right-of-way permitting jurisdiction
of the city.
         (b)   The concept plan shall be presented at a meeting of the Planning
Commission, which shall set a Planning Commission public hearing date.
Alternatively, the Planning Commission may require additional information be
provided before setting a public hearing date.
         (c)   The applicant shall, by certified mail, notify all property
owners in the city limits within 140 feet of the property and owners of
physically adjoining property outside the city limits of the Planning
Commission’s public hearing. This notice shall be postmarked a minimum of ten
days prior to the Planning Commission’s public hearing and shall include the
hearing date, time and location.
         (d)   A notice containing the date, time and place of the Planning
Commission’s public hearing shall be published in the official newspaper of the
city. Such notice shall appear a minimum of ten days prior to the public
hearing.
         (e)   Upon completion of the noticing requirements, the Planning
Commission shall hold a public hearing and forward its recommendation to the
City Council, fully setting forth the conditions of concept plan approval in
its recommendation.
         (f)   A notice containing the date, time and place of the City
Council’s public hearing shall be published in the official newspaper of the
city. Such notice shall appear once for two consecutive weeks prior to the
public hearing.
         (g)   Upon receiving public hearing testimony, the City Council shall
take action on the concept plan and, if approved, shall provide written
conditions of concept plan approval.
   (G)   Final plan. The final plan depicts detailed site development
information and is required to be submitted after the approval of a concept
plan, or along with the initial request to change zoning to DRD if the one-step
approval process is used. In no instance may other related approval activities
such as subdivision platting or issuance of a building permit commence without
the approval of the final plan.

§ 156.065 SIGN REGULATIONS.
   (A)   General provisions and purpose. By virtue of its lush Black Hills
Valley location and its largely uncluttered and unspoiled aesthetics, the
purpose of this chapter allow signage that:
      (1)   Permits a balance between the need for identification of businesses
and community activities and the need for preservation of the city’s scenic
qualities;
      (2)   Regulates the time, place and manner which include the appropriate
locations, sizes, quantity, construction and illumination methods of signs; and
      (3)   Protects the public from hazardous conditions that can result from
commercial signs which are structurally unsafe, obscure the vision of
motorists, create dangers to pedestrian traffic or which compete or conflict
with necessary traffic signals and warning signs.
   (B)   Signs subject to this chapter. The requirements of the sign
regulations apply to all signs installed within the city with the exception of:
      (1)   Changing the sign face or the copy or message on signs specifically
designed for the use of replaceable copy;
      (2)   Painting, repainting, cleaning or minor maintenance of a sign
provided that no structural alteration is made;

      (2)   Signs must be securely anchored or fastened so as not to be
displaced into the street.
      (3)   Public sidewalks and streets must not be impeded by sign placement.
      (4)   Signs must be placed in a location that does not limit visibility
of oncoming traffic at street intersections and at all site driveways onto a
public street.
      (5)   Signs may not be attached to a utility box/cabinet or transformer,
or a support pole for a traffic signal, traffic sign, street light or any
overhead utility.

Footnotes to Table 1:
1. Three or more contiguous lots under the same ownership are considered one
lot.
2. The size and number of temporary signs allowed in all locations can be
combined. For example, a business may display at the same time: one 32 square
foot sign and two 6 square foot signs, all three on private property and one 6
square foot sign in the public right-of-way.
 
   (D)   Permanent sign general regulations. Permanent signs are permitted
according to Table 2, and the standards listed below.
      (1)   The method for calculating sign size or area is:
         (a)   The actual dimensions of the outer limits of the sign face
material, excluding frames that physically hold the sign comprises the maximum
sign area.
         (b)   In the case of individual lettering on an exterior wall, awning
or other undefined structure or space, sign area is determined by calculating
the area of a geometric object large enough to cover the words forming the sign
message, around the whole of the lower case letters excluding ascenders/
descenders. If necessary, a combination of geometric objects may be used.
            1.   Example below of using a simple rectangle to calculate sign
area for individual letters (within outlined area):

            2.   Example below of using a simple rectangle or combination of
geometric shapes to calculate sign area for individual letters and/or images on
more than one line (within outlined area):

IMAGES/0-0-0-1802.png]
      (2)   For lots with more than one building, each building has its own
sign allowance per
Table 2.
      (3)   A freestanding support that displays more than one sign cabinet or
sign board is counted as one sign for the purposes of maximum number of signs
allowed.
      (4)   In addition to signs described in
Table 2, the following are permitted on private property in nonresidential
zoning districts. Three or more contiguous lots under the same ownership are
considered one lot.
         (a)   Signs ten square feet or less may be placed at a driveway that
connects to a public or private street or alley and a maximum of two signs per
lot.
         (b)   Signs 20 square feet or less and a maximum of two per lot.
         (c)   Signs 30 square feet or less may be placed immediately above a
building entryway and a maximum of two signs per building.
      (5)   Design and construction requirements of all permanent signs are as
follows.
         (a)   All exterior mounting hardware, brackets and related supporting
elements (except for freestanding support poles/posts) must not be visible. If
concealment is not possible, supporting hardware must be painted a color to
blend with the surrounding structure.
         (b)   A footing design must be submitted for freestanding signs that
are taller than 15 feet measured from grade at the bottom of the support, to
the highest part of the sign. The footing design may require a professional
engineer’s design, at the discretion of the Building Official.
         (c)   No sign may be attached to a tree, utility pole or box, vending
machine, benches, street fixtures/furnishings or other unapproved structure.
         (d)   Flexible material used for awning signs must be of canvas or
other material that is designed, sewn/assembled and fitted specifically for use
over an awning frame. Plastic sheeting, vinyl, banners and similar products not
specifically designed for awning installation must not be permitted for use as
an awning sign.
         (e)   Flexible material used as a permanent sign must be installed in
the following manner:
            1.   Must be legible and without any sagging, folds or wrinkles;
            2.   Must be attached to an exterior building wall so that the
banner is flush with the wall; and
            3.   If not attached to a building, must be attached to a fence or
a freestanding pole or structure designed specifically to hold the banner.
         (f)   All electric design must be per the applicable code adopted by
the state.
      (6)   Optional sign allowances for buildings 10,000 square feet and
larger are as follows: as an alternative to the requirements in the Commercial
and Industrial Zoning Districts, signage may be provided using the following
standards which must also apply to existing signs.
         (a)   Buildings that have a footprint of 10,000 square feet and larger
are permitted two square feet of signage for each lineal building foot on each
frontage, which is the overall maximum sign area for the lot. The maximum of
150 square feet as described in the
Table 2 pertaining to commercial and industrial districts do not apply.
         (b)   Only wall and monument signs are permitted.
         (c)   The lot lines along Interstate 90 are not considered as frontage
in the calculation of sign area.
         (d)   The design standards for monument signs are as follows:
            1.   The maximum height must not exceed 20 feet in height above
grade;
            2.   Signs must be supported by a solid base that is built of
masonry, metal, stone, brick, wood or other similar opaque material. The sign
base must not be calculated in the sign square footage; provided, that it
contains no lettering, logos or other information; and
            3.   Signs must be placed within a landscaped setting having a
minimum 1,750 points as described in the landscape material points table of
Ch. 155.
      (7)   An additional sign area bonus may be given for all signs that are
installed as monument signs. To qualify for this bonus the sign must be a
maximum of 20 feet in total height and have 1,750 landscape points installed
with the sign. For this credit, the area of the signage is calculated using the
formula of two square feet for each linear foot of building front and up to a
maximum of 150 square feet. The result is then multiplied by 1.20 to determine
the final size of the sign. Example:
 
75 feet of building front x 2 = 150 square feet.
Bonus is 150 x 1.20 = 180 square feet of signage.

      (8)   Standards for all illuminated and electronic message signs are as
follows.
         (a)   No flashing or blinking light may be used to display a message
or image or be used during the change from one message or image to another.
         (b)   Electronic message signs must not exceed 40 square feet.
         (c)   Light levels created by signage must not exceed 0.3 foot-candles
above ambient light levels as measured using a foot-candle meter at a distance
from the sign face as described in division (D)(8)(d). No sign may produce a
light level that exceeds the ambient light level at the property line.
         (d)   The distances required for measuring sign illumination must be
according to
Table 3.
         (e)   No such illuminated sign may interfere with the traveled way of
streets or obscure traffic signs or devices.
         (f)   Light measurements must be taken with the meter held facing the
sign with the sign turned off and again with the sign turned on. For electronic
message centers, the sign must be turned on to a full white image for a message
center capable of displaying a white color, or a full amber or red image for a
message center capable of displaying only an amber or red color. The difference
between the off and the white, amber or red message measurements must not
exceed the light levels described in this section.
         (g)   All electronic message signs must revert immediately to a black
screen if the sign malfunctions.
         (h)   All electronic message signs must automatically adjust in
brightness in direct correlation with ambient light conditions.
         (i)   All externally mounted sign lighting fixtures must be located to
prevent the light source from being visible except from the sign face and must
not exceed a total of 1,750 lumens.

         (j)   Enforcement of sign illumination standards are as follows.
            1.   In the case of noncompliance with the requirements of this
section, the Zoning Administrator must provide written notice to the owner of
the sign and the owner of the property upon which it is located. The notice
must identify the reason(s) such sign is in noncompliance and set forth a
period of 30 days for compliance or removal of the sign.
            2.   In circumstances when sign illumination creates a nuisance to
an adjoining property, the following procedures and standards apply:
               a.   A complaint must either be initiated by the city or by the
owner of real property affected, and the complaint must be provided in writing
to the City Administrator or his or her designee;
               b.   No sign may exceed luminance of 5,000 NITS during daylight
hours and 500 NITS evening hours (evening defined as the period starting one
hour after sunset and one hour before sunrise); and
               c.   The city must notify the sign owner of corrective measures
required, if any.
      (9)   The responsibility for keeping a sign in safe repair and properly
maintained, or for the removal of a sign if and when it is abandoned, no longer
functional, unsafe or un-maintained is joint and several of the owner of the
sign and the owner of the property upon which it is located.
      (10)   Projection, clearance and height shall be as follows.
         (a)   Signs located at a public street intersection, when within a
triangle formed by the curbline intersection and two points 25 feet in each
direction from the intersection along each curbline, must:
            1.   Not exceed two and one-half feet measured from the ground to
the uppermost part of the sign; and
            2.   If supported by a post(s) or pole(s), have a minimum vertical
clearance of ten feet above grade. This regulation will supersede any
conflicting regulations.
         (b)   Signs and awnings that extend out from an exterior wall over a
public sidewalk must maintain a minimum vertical clearance of eight feet and
must not materially impede adjacent parking or street traffic.
         (c)   The height of a sign that is not attached to a building must not
exceed 35 feet above grade to the highest portion of the sign and must not
include filled grade beneath the sign to increase sign height.
   (E)   Prohibited signs. The following are prohibited:
      (1)   Signs mounted on the ridge of a roof, on the top-most edge of a
parapet wall, or on any horizontal or sloping portion of a roof. The exceptions
to this are signs that are attached to any of the following, which are
permitted:
         (a)   Mansard roof;
         (b)   Flat or sloping canopy or awning;
         (c)   Roofed patio cover that is lower than the highest building
roofline; and
         (d)   Architectural feature located on a roof or above a roofline that
is specifically designed for signage.
      (2)   Illuminated signs containing flashing, intermitting or moving light
that interfere with the traveled way of streets or obscure traffic signs or
devices;
      (3)   Signs that constitute pedestrian or vehicular traffic hazards or
which could be confused with any governmental regulatory, directional or
warning sign;
      (4)   Signs with moving parts; signs and logos printed on or attached to
a moving surface (does not include images and text painted on the body of a
licensed motor vehicle);
      (5)   Tethered, airborne devices located within the required front
setback; and/or

§ 156.066 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   General provisions. A nonconforming use of a building and land at the
time of the adoption of this chapter is deemed to be “grandfathered” and may be
continued although the use does not conform with district regulations. Such use
may be extended throughout the building, provided no structural alterations,
except those required by law or ordinance, are made.
   (B)   Continued use.
      (1)   Whenever a district is changed, any existing nonconforming use in
the changed district may be continued, provided all other regulations governing

antenna equipment and supporting structures are intended to be located in areas
where they are the least obtrusive and most compatible with the surrounding
environment.
   (B)   Exemptions. Ordinary maintenance of existing telecommunications
facilities and support structures, as defined herein, shall be exempt from
zoning and permitting requirements. In addition, the following facilities are
not subject to the provisions of this chapter:
      (1)   Antennas used by residential households solely for broadcast radio
and television reception;
      (2)   Satellite antennas used solely for residential or household
purposes;
      (3)   COWs (carrier on wheels) placed for a period of not more than 120
days at any location within the city after a declaration of an emergency or a
disaster by the Governor or by the responsible official of the city or the
county;
      (4)   COWs (carrier on wheels) placed for a period of not more than two
weeks at any location within the city in order to serve a community event
declared as such by the City Council;
      (5)   Commercial television and AM/FM radio broadcast towers and
associated facilities; and
      (6)   Ham radio and amateur radio facilities.
   (C)   Administrative approval and use permit approval. Telecommunications
facilities are permitted in all zoning districts by either an administrative
approval or use permit, according to the standards of the telecommunications
facility approval matrix.
   (D)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      ACCESSORY EQUIPMENT. Any equipment serving or being used in conjunction
with a telecommunications facility or support structure. This EQUIPMENT
includes, but is not limited to, utility or transmission equipment, power
supplies, generators, batteries, cables, equipment buildings, cabinets and
storage sheds, shelters or other structures.
      ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL. Zoning approval that the Zoning Administrator or
designee is authorized to grant after administrative review.
      ANTENNA. Any structure or device used to collect or radiate
electromagnetic waves for the provision of cellular, paging, personal
communications services (PCS) and microwave communications. Such structures and
devices include, but are not limited to, directional antennas, such as panels,
microwave dishes and satellite dishes and omnidirectional antennas, such as
whips.
      ARCHITECTURALLY INTEGRATED. A telecommunications facility that is
primarily an architectural structure and the purpose of the facility for
providing wireless services is not readily apparent to a casual observer.
      CAMOUFLAGED. A telecommunications facility that resembles a tree, or
naturally occurring environmental feature, or, if the facility is a flag pole,
antennas are snug or stealth mounted and a flag is attached to the pole.
      CARRIER. A company authorized and licensed under the federal 1996
Telecommunications Act to provide wireless communications services to the
public.
      CARRIER ON WHEELS or CELL ON WHEELS (COW). A portable self-contained cell
site that can be moved to a location and set up to provide personal wireless
services on a temporary or emergency basis. A COW is normally vehicle-mounted
and contains a telescoping boom as the antenna support structure.
      CO-LOCATION. The act of siting telecommunications facilities in the same
location on the same support structure as other telecommunications facilities.
CO-LOCATION also means locating telecommunications facilities on an existing
structure (for example: buildings; water tanks; towers; utility poles; and the
like) without the need to construct a new support structure.
      DOWNTOWN HISTORIC. For the purposes of locating telecommunication
facilities, there are two areas that define the key historic settings in the
city. This area includes the following blocks of the Original Town including
all rights-of-way and alleys: All of Blocks 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18,
19, 20, 21, 22, 28, 29, 30, 41, 42, 43, and the east half of Block 6, east half
of Block 23, east half of Block 27, east half of Block 44, and the west half of
Block 31, and the west half of Block 40 and all of Block 41 of Uhling Addition.
(Commercial areas are Kansas to Grant Street and Canyon to 7th Street. The
residential areas are from Kansas to Illinois and from 7th Street to 11th
Street, except the block located at the northeast corner of 10th and Jackson.)
These areas represent the most significant concentration of historic property
in the city and act as the main gateway to the community. For these reasons,
telecommunications facilities must be more sensitively designed.
      I-90 CORRIDOR. For the purposes of locating telecommunication facilities,
the I-90 CORRIDOR is defined as extending 660 feet from the I-90 right-of-way
on both sides of the highway, starting at the north city limit line and ending
at the Exit 14 bridge. This is the prime view corridor and scenic gateway of
the Spearfish Valley and has been previously recognized as such when billboards
were prohibited from this area.
      MAJOR MODIFICATIONS. Improvements to existing telecommunications
facilities or support structures that result in a substantial change to the
facility or structure. MAJOR MODIFICATIONS shall include any one of the
following: extending the height of the support structure by more than 10% of
its current height; or the support structure does not meet the definition of
replacement as defined in this chapter. Co-location of new telecommunications
facilities to an existing support structure without replacement or extension of
the structure shall not constitute a MAJOR MODIFICATION. MAJOR MODIFICATIONS
shall require use permit approval.
      MINOR MODIFICATIONS. Improvements to existing telecommunications
facilities and support structures, that result in some material change to the
facility or support structure but of a level, quality or intensity that is less
than a “substantial” change. Such MINOR MODIFICATIONS include, but are not
limited to, extending the height of the support structure by less than 10% of
its current height, and the expansion of the compound area for additional
accessory equipment. Final height shall be within the same height category as
the original height as described in Table A: Design Points. Heights that are
specified in the telecommunications facility approval matrix do not apply to
facilities that exist as of July 27, 2006.
      MONOPOLE. A single, freestanding pole-type structure supporting one or
more antenna.
      ORDINARY MAINTENANCE. Ensuring that telecommunications facilities and
support structures are kept in good operating condition. ORDINARY MAINTENANCE
includes inspections, testing and modifications that maintain functional
capacity, aesthetic and structural integrity; for example, the strengthening of
a support structure’s foundation or of the support structure itself. ORDINARY
MAINTENANCE includes replacing antennas and accessory equipment on a like-for-
like basis within an existing telecommunications facility and relocating the
antennas of approved telecommunications facilities to different height levels
on an existing monopole or tower upon which they are currently located.
ORDINARY MAINTENANCE does not include minor and major modifications.
      PUBLICLY OWNED BUILDING. A building or structure owned by a city, state,
county or public school district.
      REPLACEMENT. Constructing a new support structure of equal height and
proportions to a preexisting support structure in order to accommodate
collocation and removing the pre-existing support structure.
      STEALTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITY. Any telecommunications facility that
is integrated as an architectural feature of a structure so that the purpose of
the facility for providing wireless services is not readily apparent to a
casual observer.
      SUPPORT STRUCTURE(S). A structure primarily designed to support
telecommunications facilities, including, but not limited to, monopoles, towers
and other freestanding self-supporting structures.
      TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITY. Any unmanned facility established for the
purpose of providing wireless transmission of radio frequency signals,
writings, sounds, messages, voice, data, images or other information of any
nature by radio, lightwaves, electromagnetic means or other similar means,
including, but not limited to, wireless telephone service, personal
communications service (PCS), wireless internet and paging service. A
TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITY consists of one or more antennas, equipment cabinet,
a support structure and accessory equipment.
      TOWER. A lattice-type structure, guyed or freestanding, that supports one
or more antennas.
   (E)   Approval processes and facility design requirements. All facilities
will be reviewed according to the telecommunications facility approval matrix,
which lists the various locations, zoning districts and applications that will
be permitted by administrative approval, or use permit approval. All
applications for architectural integration shall be reviewed in compliance with
the city publication titled Architectural Integration Design Guidelines For
Telecommunications Facilities.

§ 156.068 PORTABLE STORAGE CONTAINERS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The unregulated use, maintenance and placement of
portable storage containers (PSCs) within the city create potentially unsightly
and incompatible conditions. The following regulations are established to allow
the use of PSCs to allow residents and business owners flexibility in their
use, with reasonable limits to promote compatibility with adjoining land uses.
   (B)   Definition. For the purpose of this section, the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      PORTABLE STORAGE CONTAINERS (PSCS).
         (a)   Standardized prefabricated metal structures originally designed
for, or used in, the packing, storage, shipping, movement or transportation of
cargo, freight, goods, equipment or commodities. The PSC is fully enclosed with
a floor, walls, ceiling and a sealed door to withstand harsh environmental
conditions and is transported from place to place by being loaded on a flatbed
trailer.
         (b)   All trailers required to be titled and licensed in order to be
towed on a highway are exempt from this definition. Structures designed for
human occupancy according to HUD’s standards are exempt from this definition.
   (C)   Permitted temporary placement of PSCs; all zoning districts.
      (1)   PSCs are permitted on private property when a city-issued building
or grading permit is in effect for that same property. PSCs for city
construction projects on city property or in the public right-of-way are
permitted with the City Engineer’s approval.
      (2)   If not in relation to a construction site, a maximum of one PSC is
allowed without a permit to be located within a public right-of-way for a
period of maximum of 72 hours.
      (3)   The time period in division (C)(2) above may be extended to a
maximum of 30 days with the Zoning Administrator’s approval; provided, that the
PSC is on private property and the side setback requirements of the zoning
district are met. The PSC shall be deemed as a temporary permitted use.
      (4)   Maximum number of PSCs allowed for temporary use is as follows.
         (a)   One PSC of any size is allowed per 1,200 square feet of building
area.
         (b)   Up to three PSCs are allowed with the Zoning Administrator’s
approval.
   (D)   Permitted permanent placement of PSCs.
      (1)   A PSC shall be permitted to be permanently placed in the C-1, C-2,
C-3, Light and Heavy Industrial and Airport Zoning Districts. Permanent
placement is prohibited in RLS-1, AG, R-1, R-2, R-3, CC, DRD and parks
recreation open space districts.
      (2)   PSCs shall be governed by the city’s adopted building codes.
      (3)   PSCs shall be located on property where the primary permitted use
is established and shall comply with the area regulations of the applicable
zoning district and shall not unreasonably create an impact to parking spaces
or parking lot driveways.
      (4)   A PSC shall be placed so that it is set back the same distance from
the street as the existing building. For lots having two or more street
frontages, at least one frontage must comply with this requirement and the PSC
can be placed at the building setback for the remaining frontages.
      (5)   A maximum of two PSCs are allowed to be stacked vertically.
      (6)   A maximum of two PSCs are permitted.
      (7)   The containers shall be maintained at all times from all types of
visible deterioration such as rusting, peeling paint, graffiti and the like.
The owner of the portable storage container shall be responsible for its
maintenance.
   (E)   Exemptions from this chapter. The following are exempt from the
regulations of this section:
      (1)   Businesses that offer PSCs for sale or rent to the public and the
PSCs are stored from time to time at the business owner’s commercial,
industrial or airport zoned property. The aforementioned requirements for
setbacks, permits and placement locations shall not apply;
      (2)   PSCs that are part of a construction contractor’s business
equipment inventory and are stored from time to time at the contractor’s place
of business located in a commercial, industrial or airport zoned property;
      (3)   PSCs that are used in connection with an emergency as declared by
public safety officials; and
      (4)   PSCs that comply with the adopted building, fire, plumbing and
mechanical codes of the city, and are used for residential and nonresidential
occupancy and not storage.
   (F)   Compliance. PSCs that exist as of October 15, 2018 that do not comply
to these standards must do so by October 15, 2019.
(Prior Code, App. A, Art. V, § 10) (Ord. 1293, passed 10-15-2018)
§ 156.069 SMALL WIND ENERGY SYSTEMS (SWES).
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of these standards is to define the review
criteria that will be used in considering conditional use permit requests for
SWES. Meteorological towers are not subject to this chapter.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      METEOROLOGICAL TOWER (MET TOWER). Defined to include the tower, base
plate, anchors, guy cables and hardware, measuring devices such as anemometers
(wind speed indicators), wind direction vanes, booms to hold anemometers and
vanes, data logger, instrument wiring and any telemetry devices that are used
to monitor or transmit data such as wind speed and wind flow characteristics
over a period of time for either instantaneous wind information or to
characterize the wind resource at a given location.
      ROOF MOUNTED. A system mounted on and totally supported by a structure or
structure that complies with current codes, but not supported by a tower.
      SHADOW FLICKER. Alternating changes in light intensity caused by rotating
parts that cast shadows on the ground and stationary objects such as an
occupied structure.
      SMALL WIND ENERGY SYSTEM (SWES). Equipment arranged in any configuration
that converts or transfers energy from the wind into usable forms of electrical
energy or mechanical function. This equipment includes the wind generator and
related components and supporting structures.
      TOTAL HEIGHT. The following:
         (a)   For a horizontal axis system, the vertical distance from ground
level to the tip of a wind generator blade when the tip is at its highest
point;
         (b)   For a vertical axis system, the vertical distance from ground
level to the highest point of the SWES, excluding lightning rods; and
         (c)   For a roof mounted system, the vertical distance from ground
level to the highest point of the SWES.
      TOWER MOUNTED. A system mounted on a monopole, freestanding or guyed
structure that supports a wind generator.
      WIND GENERATOR. The parts of the system that are activated by the force
of the wind along with any associated mechanical and electrical connections and
components.
   (C)   Conditional use permit approval criteria for small wind energy systems
(SWES).
      (1)   Certification. All SWES must either be certified by its
manufacturer or a licensed professional engineer to meet current
recommendations of the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), or the British
Wind Energy Association (BWEA), or the United States Department of Energy
(DOE), with evidence of certification submitted at the time of application for
a conditional use permit.
      (2)   Setbacks. The SWES shall adhere to the setbacks as described below.
         (a)   A setback distance of one and one-tenth times the height of the
system is required along all property lines.
         (b)   If the manufacturer’s recommended setback for mitigation of any
impact to an adjoining lot is greater than as described in division (C)(2)(a)
above, the manufacturer’s setback is required.
      (3)   Maximum total height. The maximum total height of any SWES shall be
less than 75 feet for C-2, I-LR, I-H, DRD and APZ zoning districts.

such lighting is required by the Federal Aviation Administration.
      (6)   Appearance, color and finish. SWES shall be painted a color which
is deemed to be compatible with the surroundings. Dark muted earth tones are
preferred to lighter colors. If manufacturers’ specifications do not permit
changing the factory paint finish, this shall be disclosed at the time of
application for approval.
      (7)   Limits. A maximum of one tower mounted wind generator is permitted
per lot. A maximum of two roof mounted wind generators are permitted per lot.
Both tower and roof mounted wind generators are permitted on the same lot.
      (8)   Location. The SWES shall be located such that it does not create
noise impacts above the ambient noise level at the property line that is
closest to the SWES.
      (9)   Shadow flicker. An application for a SWES will not be approved if
it would cause shadow flicker at any time of day or night, regardless of
season, to fall onto:
         (a)   An existing occupied structure on an adjacent lot; or

(Prior Code, App. A, Art. VI, § 1) (Ord. 969, passed 8-18-2003; Ord. 999,
passed 2-7-2005)
§ 156.081 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Generally. A variance modifies the strict application of a particular
zoning regulation in unique and individual cases where the application of the
regulation would result in a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship.
Variances are to be granted under exceptional circumstances and shall only be
for the minimum necessary relief.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   Variances may not be granted to allow a use prohibited or
ineligible for a conditional use permit.
      (2)   A variance may be granted for the development standards found
within the area regulations of each zoning district that apply to maximum/
minimum numerical distances, maximum/minimum numerical quantities, ratios,
square footage type standards and parking standards.
   (C)   Application and approval procedure.
      (1)   A property owner may apply to the Board of Adjustment for a
variance, using forms available from the Zoning Administrator. Fees, as set
forth in the fee schedule adopted by resolution of the City Council, shall
accompany the application.
      (2)   Upon receiving a complete application for variance, the Zoning
Administrator shall place the application on the Planning Commission’s regular
agenda.
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall review the variance request, set
forth its findings, forward its recommendation to the Board of Adjustment, and
set the date of the Board of Adjustment’s public hearing.
      (4)   A minimum of ten days prior to the date of the Board of
Adjustment’s public hearing, the applicant shall post a sign measuring 18 by 24
inches on the property for which the variance is requested, notifying the
public of the date and time of the public hearing. The Zoning Administrator
shall provide the applicant with the sign. The applicant shall be responsible
for ensuring the sign remains posted on the property until the public hearing
is held.
      (5)   Legal notice of the Board of Adjustment public hearing shall be
published in the official city newspaper ten days prior to the hearing. The
notice shall contain the date, time and place of the public hearing.
      (6)   The Board of Adjustment shall issue its decision within 30 days of
the public hearing. A variance shall be considered approved if the application
receives an affirmative vote by a two-thirds’ majority of present and voting
members of the Board of Adjustment. As a condition of approval, the Board of
Adjustment may impose, consistent with the general purpose and intent of the
zoning ordinance, appropriate conditions and safeguards to any variance
granted.
      (7)   The decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be documented by
written findings of fact and conclusions of law based on the evaluation
criteria.
   (D)   Evaluation criteria. A variance shall be approved only if the
applicant is able to satisfy each of the following three criteria:
      (1)   The requested variance is not contrary to the public interest, as
determined by the Board of Adjustment. In order to fulfill the public interest,
the proposed variance must not:
         (a)   Alter the essential character of the locality; or
         (b)   Endanger public safety.
      (2)   The requested variance must result from special physical conditions
on the property, which:
         (a)   Are natural or human-made surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions that do not result from persons presently having an interest in the
property; or
         (b)   Because the property is situated within any of the following
downtown core neighborhoods and has a lot width of 75 feet or less, or a square
footage of less than 8,000 square feet:
            1.   Original Town Plat;
            2.   Uhlig Addition;
            3.   Ramsdell Addition;
            4.   West Addition; and
            5.   Schar’s Addition.
      (3)   A literal enforcement of the provisions will result in unnecessary
hardship:
         (a)   Because of the special physical conditions of the property,
unusual hardship that would serve no public purpose would result to the owner
if required to act in strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning
regulations and the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to
enable the reasonable use of the property; and
         (b)   The hardship must be unique to a particular piece of property to
justify a variance, and not shared by all property in a particular zone.
   (E)   Recording. If the variance is granted, the Zoning Administrator shall
cause the resolution approving the variance to be recorded in the Office of the
County Register of Deeds once a building permit has been issued and
construction has commenced. The variance shall thereafter run with the land.
   (F)   Denial. If an application for a variance is denied, reapplication
shall not be permitted for a period of one year, unless the Zoning
Administrator determines that the nature of the application has materially
changed.
   (G)   Expiration.
      (1)   A variance shall automatically expire in one of the following
circumstances:
         (a)   A building permit has not been issued within 18 months of the
variance approval; or
         (b)   A building permit has been issued, but construction has not
commenced within one year of permit issuance.
      (2)   This section is expressly made retroactive to apply to variances
granted prior to the passage of this chapter.
(Prior Code, App. A, Art. VI, § 2) (Ord. 1267, passed 9-18-2017)
§ 156.082 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS (CUP).
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   Each zoning district enumerates certain uses permitted by right and
certain conditional uses. A conditional use is a use that is not permitted by
right, but which may be permitted in a zoning district, based upon the review
of compliance with specific criteria, public hearing and imposed conditions.
      (2)   The city recognizes that diversity and the blending of compatible
uses is essential to a healthy and dynamic community. Toward that end, the
following procedure is established to properly integrate conditional uses with
permitted uses in various zoning districts, which the Common Council finds to
be in accordance with the objectives of the comprehensive plan.
      (3)   Each category of conditional use is listed in individual zoning
districts. If a use is not identified on the list of conditional uses, or if
the Zoning Administrator is unable to make an interpretation that a proposed
use is analogous to those listed, the use is not permitted in that particular
zoning district.
   (B)   Approving authority. Application for a CUP shall be approved or denied
by the Planning Commission following a recommendation from the Zoning
Administrator. A CUP shall be considered approved by the Planning Commission if
the application receives an affirmative vote by a simple majority of the
present and voting members.
   (C)   Evaluation criteria. In either making a recommendation to approve or
deny, or acting to approve or deny an application for a CUP, the following
criteria shall be considered:
      (1)   The proposed use shall comply with other ordinances. A CUP may not
be issued to allow a use otherwise prohibited specifically identified as being
eligible for a CUP;
      (2)   The proposed use shall be eligible for a CUP based on the zoning
district;
      (3)   The proposed use shall comply with the setback, lot coverage,
height and other requirements of the zoning district, unless the subject
property is currently legally nonconforming or a request for a variance is
simultaneously submitted with the application for a CUP;
      (4)   The proposed use shall be compatible with the location, physical
character and topographic features of the property;
      (5)   Buffering measures along parcel boundaries shall exist or be
incorporated to mitigate any visual impact of outdoor use areas onto adjacent
property;
      (6)   If applicable, lighting from all sources shall be designed so that
it does not unreasonably affect adjacent property;
      (7)   The proposed use shall not create an unreasonable public safety
issue relating to the property or its surroundings, nor increase the risks of
an existing public safety issue;
      (8)   The proposed use shall have adequate pedestrian and vehicular
access, circulation and parking, including those related to bicycle
transportation and transportation by persons with physical disabilities;
      (9)   The proposed use shall not result in any unusual or unreasonable
parking impacts.
      (10)   The proposed use shall not result in an unusual or unreasonable
number of vehicle trips per day as measured against the character of the
neighborhood of the subject property and the street network serving it;
      (11)   The proposed use shall not result in an unusual or unreasonable
level of noise;
      (12)   Adequate public services and utilities shall be available to
accommodate the proposed use;
      (13)   Additional imposed conditions, if any, will mitigate any probable
adverse impacts of the proposed use; and
      (14)   For applications for small wind energy systems (SWES) only, the
specific conditional use permit criteria for the SWES has been met.
   (D)   Application and approval procedure.
      (1)   A property owner or a designated representative may apply for a
CUP, using forms available from the Zoning Administrator. Fees shall be
required as established by City Council resolution. The Zoning Administrator
shall review the application for completeness and select the date of the
Planning Commission’s public hearing.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall send, by first class mail postmarked
a minimum of ten days prior to the date of the Planning Commission public
hearing, a notice to the owner of record of each parcel situated within 140
feet of the subject property, exclusive of rights-of-way, of the nature of the
request and the date, place and time of the public hearing of the Planning
Commission.
      (3)   A minimum of ten days prior to the date of the public hearing, the
applicant shall post a sign on the property for which the CUP is requested,
notifying the public of the date and time of the public hearing. Sign size and
content shall be according to the site posting guidelines adopted by the City
Council. The applicant shall be responsible for acquiring the sign and
following the procedures as indicated in the guidelines.
      (4)   Prior to the public hearing, the Zoning Administrator shall review
the merits of the application and forward his or her recommendation to the
Planning Commission, together with any recommended conditions regarding the
location, character or other features of the proposed use as the Zoning
Administrator may deem advisable in the furtherance of the general purposes of
this section. In his or her recommendation, the Zoning Administrator shall
fully set forth the findings to support his or her recommendation and
conditions.
      (5)   The Planning Commission shall hold its public hearing, having given
ten days’ notice of the date, place and time of the hearing in the city’s
designated legal newspaper.
      (6)   Within 30 days of its public hearing, the Planning Commission shall
issue its approval or denial fully, setting forth the findings to support its
decision to approve or deny. The Planning Commission may approve the CUP
application with added conditions it may deem advisable in the furtherance of
the general purposes of this section or another city ordinance.
      (7)   The findings of the Planning Commission shall be documented in a
written statement that includes:
         (a)   A listing of the criteria from §
156.082(C), along with an explanation as to whether each criterion has or has
not been met. In circumstances where an individual criterion does not apply, an
explanation shall be provided of why it does not apply; and
         (b)   The voting record of the Planning Commission, the date of the
Planning Commission’s action and the signature of the Planning Commission
chair.
   (E)   Appeal. The Planning Commission’s action taken on a CUP may be
appealed to the Board of Adjustment by any person aggrieved by the decision, or
by any officer, department, board or bureau of the municipality affected by the
decision, according to the following procedure.
      (1)   Notice of appeal must be filed with the Zoning Administrator within
ten days of the decision of the Planning Commission. The notice of appeal shall
specify the grounds of the appeal, which shall include specific reference to
the Planning Commission’s finding(s) alleged to be in error or how the city
failed to regularly pursue its authority. If a notice of appeal is accepted by
the Zoning Administrator, the approval of the CUP in question shall be stayed
until the appeal is finally resolved by the issuance of the Board of
Adjustment’s decision.
      (2)   At its next meeting, the Planning Commission shall set a public
hearing before the Board of Adjustment.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall compile the record and forward it to
the Board of Adjustment no later than ten days before the public hearing.
      (4)   The record shall be a public document and will consist of the CUP
application, staff report, minutes of the Planning Commission meeting where the
CUP was considered, findings of fact and conclusion of law adopted by the
Planning Commission and any relevant attachments or exhibits.
      (5)   The Zoning Administrator shall send, by first class mail postmarked
a minimum of ten days prior to the date of the Board of Adjustment public
hearing, a notice to the following:
         (a)   Each person who provided his or her mailing address while
offering testimony during the Planning Commission hearing when the CUP was
first approved;
         (b)   Each owner of record of each parcel situated within 140 feet of
the subject property, exclusive of rights-of-way; and
         (c)   The notice shall include the date, place and time of the public
hearing of the Board of Adjustment. The notice shall include a statement that
copies of the record of the Planning Commission’s decision are available for
review and photocopying at the office of the Zoning Administrator.
      (6)   It shall require a two-thirds’ vote of the members of the Board of
Adjustment to reverse or modify the decision of the Planning Commission.
   (F)   Denial. If an application for a CUP is denied, reapplication shall not
be permitted for a period of one year, unless the Zoning Administrator
determines that the nature of the application has materially changed.
   (G)   Review. Upon receipt of a written complaint filed by a party directly
affected and upon a determination by the Zoning Administrator that the
complaint states sufficient cause to review a CUP, or at the Zoning
Administrator’s independent determination that sufficient cause exists to
review a CUP, the Zoning Administrator may request that the Planning Commission
conduct a format review of a CUP. A written complaint shall contain a detailed
description of an impermissible use not allowed by the existing zoning or not
permitted by the CUP.
   (H)   Revocation. A CUP may be revoked by the Planning Commission only for
cause, consisting of failure to maintain the standards or conditions under
which the CUP was issued, and according to the following procedure.
      (1)   A notice of intent to revoke a CUP shall be sent by the Zoning
Administrator to the person that holds the CUP. The notice shall be in writing
and sent via certified mail or hand delivery and shall specify the area or
areas of failure to meet requirements and maintain conditions that may have
been imposed and provide a deadline for compliance.
      (2)   If, prior to the deadline, proof of compliance is made by the
holder of the CUP, the CUP shall be continued in force.
      (3)   Upon notice of intent to revoke, the holder of a CUP has the right
to request a public hearing. If such a request is made, the Planning Commission
shall hold a public hearing on the matter and make a final determination on the
revocation.
      (4)   If, upon receiving a notice of intent to revoke, the holder of a
CUP requests a public hearing, the Zoning Administrator shall send, by
certified mail postmarked a minimum of ten days prior to the date of the
Planning Commission revocation public hearing, a notice of the date, place and
time of such public hearing to such holder and to each owner of record of each
parcel situated within 140 feet of the subject property, exclusive of rights-
of-way.
      (5)   If, following notice, the holder of a CUP does not assert his or
her right to a public hearing, the CUP shall be deemed to be revoked on the
thirty-first day following the notice.
   (I)   Expiration. A CUP shall automatically expire if:
      (1)   The use for which it was approved ceased for a period of two years;
or
      (2)   The use for which it was approved has not been undertaken and
completed according to the terms and conditions of the CUP within one year of
approval or within one year of the time specified in the CUP for completion,
whichever is later. A CUP is considered approved upon the effective date of the
Planning Commission’s or Board of Adjustment’s approval, whichever is later.
   (J)   Amendments. A CUP may be amended. Amendments are considered major or
minor and are addressed in the following manner.
      (1)   Major amendments must be reviewed by the Planning Commission, under
the provisions of this section. The notice, hearing, criteria, fee and other
provisions apply as though the application is for a new CUP. A major amendment
is one where:
         (a)   A new conditional use is proposed;
         (b)   The applicant proposes any change to specific conditions
approved by the Planning Commission in the initial approval or as modified by
the Board of Adjustment;
         (c)   The structure or site is substantially enlarged by increasing
the gross square footage by more than 20%; or
         (d)   The Zoning Administrator determines that the amendment is major.
      (2)   Minor amendments may be reviewed and approved by the Zoning
Administrator. A minor amendment is one where the Zoning Administrator
determines that the proposed amendment or modification to the site will not
have a significant adverse impact on neighboring properties, the street network
or the appearance of the property, and is otherwise in conformance with the
spirit of the initial approval. The Zoning Administrator shall consider the
criteria outlined in this section to determine if the proposed amendment or
modifications still meet the requirements of a CUP.
   (K)   Transfer.
      (1)   A CUP may be transferred from the original holder to a new holder,
subject to the conditions and restrictions of the original CUP. Any proposed
change in use must be submitted to the Zoning Administrator as an amendment. To
transfer to a new holder, a letter providing the new CUP holder’s contact name
(s), address and telephone number, shall be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator who shall then update the CUP record accordingly.
      (2)   Conditional use permits (formerly known as “use permits” or “uses
permitted on review”) issued before the effective date of this section shall be
governed by the approvals and conditions given at the time of approval.
However, any proposed amendments or revocation proceedings shall be governed by
this section.

shall be required to submit according to the provisions of divisions (A) and
(B) above.
   (D)   Owners that wish to release a development lot agreement shall do so by
completing the development lot agreement application form for Zoning
Administrator approval and shall demonstrate they meet the following criteria,
where applicable:

development lot agreement no longer exist; and
      (2)   A building permit for the main/primary permitted use is issued for
