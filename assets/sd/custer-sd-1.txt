PREFACE
   The Custer City Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing
Company in 1996, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew
Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest, and by American Legal
Publishing beginning in 2009.
   During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and
indexed under the direction of Robert Anderson, city attorney.
   The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor
decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation
without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number
designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus,
Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, located in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. In most
instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine
vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions.
Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion.
   In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying
the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative
history is complemented by a prior code cross-reference table, which sets out
the location of individual sections of the prior code, and an ordinance
disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all
ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification.
   A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific
code provisions by individual section numbers.
   This supplement brings the code up to date through September 15, 2025, with
Ordinance 935, passed 9-15-2025.

   B.   Subdivision regulations may provide that, in lieu of the completion of
such work and installations prior to the final approval of a plat, the city
council may accept bond or other financial guaranty, in an amount and with
surety and conditions satisfactory to it, providing for and securing to the

within a period specified by the city council and expressed in the bond; and
the city is granted the power to enforce the bonds or other financial
guaranties by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies.
   C.   Subdivision regulations may provide, in lieu of the completion of such
work and installations previous to the final approval of a plat, for an
assessment or other method whereby the city is put in an assured position to do
the work and make the installations at the cost of the owners of the property
within the subdivision. (Ord. 556 (part), 2002)
2.32.190   Improvements in unapproved streets.

provided by Section
2.32.200, accept, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave or light any street, or
lay or authorize the laying of water mains, sewers, connections or other
facilities or utilities in any street within the municipality unless such
street has been accepted or opened as, or has otherwise received the legal
status of, a public street prior to the adoption of a comprehensive plan, or

a subdivision plat approved by the council or on a street plat made by the
planning commission and adopted by the council or reviewed and approved. (Ord.

construction or for such acceptance be first submitted to the planning
commission for its consideration, and, if disapproved by the commission, be
passed by not less than two-thirds of the entire membership of the city council
or said governing body. A street approval by the commission upon such
submission, or constructed or accepted by a two-thirds vote after disapproval
by the commission, has the status of an approved street as fully as though it
had been originally shown on a subdivision plat approved by the council or on a
plat made by the commission and adopted by the council. (Ord. 556 (part), 2002)
2.32.210   New buildings on unapproved streets.

Section
2.32.160, no building permit may be issued for or no building may be erected on
any lot within the territorial jurisdiction of the commission and council as
provided in Section 2.32. 160, unless the street giving access to the lot upon
which the building is proposed to be placed is accepted as opened as, or has
otherwise received the legal status of, a public street prior to that time, or
unless such street corresponds in its location and lines with a street shown on
a recorded subdivision plat approved by the council or on a street plat made by
the commission and adopted by the council or with a street located or accepted
by the council, or, in the case of territory outside of the municipal
corporation, by the governing body thereof, after submission to the commission,
and, in case of the commission’s disapproval, by the favorable vote required in
Sections 2.32.200 and 2.32.210. Any building erected in violation of this
section is an unlawful structure, and the municipality or governing body may
bring action to enjoin such erection or cause it to be vacated or removed.

operating procedures, provides written notification to the city regarding such
transfer and new owners meet the requirements of all city ordinances and state
laws.
   A cannabis establishment may not operate at any location other than the
address designated in the approved license application unless the license
holder requests and receives approval from the city and state to transfer the
license to a new location. Such approval shall only be granted if the proposed
location complies with all requirements and criteria set forth in this chapter
and all other applicable ordinances. (Ord. 931, 2025: Ord. 873 (part), 2022:

2022)
5.10.150 Liability for violations.
   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for the purposes of this chapter,
an act by an employee or agent of a cannabis establishment that constitutes
grounds for suspension or revocation will be imputed to the cannabis
establishment license holder for purposes of finding a violation of this
chapter, or for purposes of license denial, suspension, or revocation, only if
an officer, director or general partner or a person who managed, supervised or
controlled the operation of the cannabis establishment knowingly allowed such
act to occur on the premises. (Ord. 873 (part), 2022; Ord. 858 (part), 2021)

6.04.030   Restraint.
   All animals shall be kept under restraint.
   A.   No owner or custodian shall fail to exercise proper care and control of
his/her animals to prevent them from becoming a public nuisance. The owner or
custodian of such animal shall, immediately after the animal passes excreta,
remove such excreta and appropriately dispose of the same.
   B.   Every female animal in heat shall be confined in a building or secure
enclosure in such a manner that the female animal cannot come into contact with
another animal not for planned breeding.
   C.   Every vicious animal, as determined by the licensing authority, shall
be confined by the owner within a building or secure enclosure and shall be
securely muzzled or caged and under full control of a competent person whenever
off the premises of its owner. After an animal has been declared vicious, the
owner of the dog shall be notified accordingly in writing by law enforcement,
animal control officer or designee. The written notification shall also include
any containment procedures or facilities deemed necessary by law enforcement,
animal control officer or designee to control the animal which may include, but
necessarily be limited to, muzzling, chaining, double fencing, or caging. Any
animal that has been declared vicious by the procedures set forth in this
section that is subsequently found off the premises of the owner or if law
enforcement, animal control officer or designee determines that a violation of
the written containment notice has occurred, law enforcement, animal control
officer or designee shall immediately seize and impound the dog. If the dog
cannot be captured without undue risk to the safety of law enforcement, animal
control officer or designee, it may be immediately destroyed in a manner
whereby the head is not damaged. If the dog has been seen running at large and/
or has bitten a person or animal, law enforcement, animal control officer or
designee may order the owner or custodian to deliver the dog to the animal
control center within twenty-four (24) hours to be impounded.
   D.   If any dangerous, fierce or vicious animal is found at large and cannot
be safely taken up and impounded, such animal may be slain by any officer or
agent. Proof of the fact that such animal has attacked or bitten any person or
animal at any place where such person or animal is legally entitled to be shall
be evidence that such animal is vicious, fierce and dangerous within the
meaning of this chapter.
   E.   Any animal attacking any person or persons, or clothing of the persons,
in a vicious manner, may be destroyed immediately to protect the safety of that
person or persons. Should the animal not be destroyed, and the owner or
custodian of the animal is located, the owner may be fined in accordance with
ordinances governing the endangering of safety.
   F.   No person may allow an animal under their control to make loud noises
to the great discomfort of the peace and quiet in such continuous manner as to
materially disturb or annoy persons who are of ordinary sensibilities. Upon
notice to the owner if the problem is not resolved, a criminal summons may be
issued, or a fine imposed of thirty dollars ($30.00) for the first offense.
   G.   It is unlawful to allow any animal to be at large upon property other
than the property owned or occupied by the owner of such animal unless under
the control of a competent person. Any law enforcement, or animal control
officer or designee is authorized, empowered and directed to impound any such
animal running at large in violation of the provisions of this section. A fine
may be issued to an owner if it is not possible to capture the animal and
impound it by law enforcement, animal control officer, or designee. All fines
are to be paid to the licensing authority and its agents within seventy-two
(72) hours following the issuance of such penalty; failure to do so will result
in criminal summons being issued. An owner of an unlicensed animal shall have
seventy-two (72) hours in which to license his or her animal after receiving
such notice. Failure to do so may result in the issuance of criminal summons.
   H.   An officer or duly appointed person may enter upon private property to
capture any animal found running at large thereon when the animal is not the
property of the owner or occupant of the land.
   I.   Immediately upon impounding any animal, law enforcement, animal control
officer or designee shall make every possible effort to notify the owner of
such animal and inform them of the conditions whereby they may regain
possession of the animal. Any animal, whether unlicenced or licensed, which is
captured while in violation of this chapter shall be impounded in the animal
control center. All licensed or unlicensed animals may be held for a period of
three (3) days, after which time animals not claimed by their owners may be
placed for adoption, or may be humanely destroyed by trained, authorized
personnel, i.e. veterinarian.
   J.   Any owner reclaiming an animal must pay an impoundment fee per day for
each day the animal has been impounded as agreed upon by Custer City and law
enforcement or the animal control officer and any veterinarian service fees.
Any animal impounded and subsequently returned to its owner shall be implanted
with a microchip prior to its release from the animal shelter and the owner of
the animal shall be responsible for paying and cost incurred prior to the
animal’s release. If a dog is unlicensed, the owner must, prior to the release
of the dog from the animal control center, purchase a license tag. At the time
of release, the owner shall also present a valid rabies certificate to law
enforcement, animal control officer or designee. If a valid rabies certificate
cannot be made available, the owner may be subject to a fine of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) and must then obtain the rabies vaccination within seventy-two
(72) hours of release of the dog or show evidence that an appointment has been
made to get the vaccine. In the event the animal has not been vaccinated for
rabies within seventy-two (72) hours after the release or at the time an
appointment had been made, the owner or custodian may be subject to a fine of
twenty-five dollars ($25.00).
   K.   Any person finding any animal upon his property to his injury or
annoyance may take up same and shall contact law enforcement, animal control
officer or designee for removal to any private or public animal shelter or
pound that will take possession of it.
   L.   No person shall permit any wild, feral, or vicious animals of any type
to remain upon property owned, or occupied, by the person within the city.
   M.   The sole exception to this prohibition is a guard dog that is
professionally trained, and fully controlled by voice command, or a dog that is
enclosed within a pen so that it is inaccessible to children or other pets.
(Ord. 749, 2014; Ord. 640 (part), 2007; Ord. 636 (part), 2006)
6.04.040   Rabies, bite cases, quarantine.
   All domestic animals shall be vaccinated against rabies at the required age
of each animal as determined by veterinarian standards.
   A.   Rabies vaccination must be renewed every three years on all domestic
animals. Puppies are required to have the first vaccination which is good for
one year.
   B.   A valid rabies certificate shall be issued listing the owner's name,
address, telephone number, date of vaccination, type of rabies vaccine
administered, rabies vaccination tag number, manufacturer's serial number of
vaccine, and description of animal including its age, breed, sex and name. It
must be signed by a licensed veterinarian.
   C.   A valid rabies certificate must be presented at the time of
registration to the licensing authority.
   D.   Any animal suspected of or being rabid shall be reported to law
enforcement, the animal control officer, or designee or the county health

disposed of in such a manner as to preserve the head structure.
   E.   It shall be the duty of every physician or other practitioner to report
to law enforcement, animal control officer or designee, the names and addresses
of persons treated for bites inflicted by animals, together with such
information as will be helpful in rabies control.
   F.   Every owner having knowledge that their animal has bitten or is
suspected of biting a human being, shall forthwith report same to law
enforcement, animal control officer or designee for disposition of the animal
under the provisions of this chapter.
   G.   All quarantine procedures, and all procedure for management of animals
that have bitten humans, animals exposed to rabies, and rabid animals, will be
in accordance with the current Compendium of Animal Rabies Control promulgated
by the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, Inc. In case
of conflict between the Compendium and this chapter concerning the quarantines
and procedures, the recommendation in the Compendium will take precedence over
this chapter.
   H.   Any animal shall be considered unvaccinated unless proof of a current
rabies vaccination effected not less than thirty (30) days prior to the bite as
provided within twenty-four (24) hours of the bite. Law enforcement, animal
control officer or designee or the State Department of Health may order the
destruction of any unvaccinated animal that has bitten any person if, based on
sound medical judgments, a greater risk to human life exists by not doing so.
In making such a determination the following facts may be considered:
   1.   The history of the animal, including the possibility of its exposure to
rabies.
   2.   The vaccination record of the animal.
   3.   The health of the animal.
   4.   The nature, location, and seriousness of the bite.
   5.   The circumstances surrounding the bite, including whether or not the
bite was provoked.
   6.   The tolerance of the person bitten to the vaccines used for treatment.
   I.   Any animal that bites or attacks a person shall be quarantined at the
direction of law enforcement, animal control officer, designee, or any
veterinarian for a period of not less than ten (10) days. During quarantine the
animal shall be securely confined and kept from contact with any other animal
or humans other than the caretaker. The owner shall surrender the animal for
the quarantine period to law enforcement, animal control officer, designee, or
shall place it in a veterinary hospital, either confinement to be at the
owner’s expense.
   J.   At the end of the specified quarantine period, the animal will be
examined by a veterinarian at the owner’s expense. If the veterinarian finds
that the animal is showing no clinical signs or symptoms known to be present in
active cases of rabies, the animal will be released from quarantine and may be
reclaimed by the owner. The veterinarian shall so notify law enforcement,
animal control officer or designee.
   K.   Any stray animal that bites a person, if its ownership cannot be
ascertained within forty-eight (48) hours of the bite, shall be euthanized and
law enforcement, animal control officer or designee shall arrange to have the
animal’s head sent to a competent laboratory to be examined for rabies.
   L.   When any animal has been diagnosed by a veterinarian as being rabid or
dies during quarantine or rabies observation, the veterinarian or law
enforcement, animal control officer or designee shall immediately send the head
of such animal to a competent laboratory for pathological examination and shall
notify the proper public health officials, law enforcement, animal control
officer, or designee of reports of human contacts and the diagnosis made of the
suspected animal.
   M.   Every owner whose animal is bitten or scratched by animal showing
positive symptoms of rabies or by a wild or carnivorous mammal or bat not
available for testing, shall have the animal examined by a veterinarian at the
owner’s expense. The animal shall be euthanized, quarantined or held for
further observation as requested and the owner shall be responsible for all
expenses incurred as a result thereof.
   N.   Any person who kills or causes to be killed any rabid animal, any
animal suspected of having been exposed to rabies, or any animal biting a
human, shall immediately report same to law enforcement, animal control officer
or designee. No person may sell, give away, remove from the city, or otherwise
dispose of such animal without written permission from law enforcement, animal
control officer or designee. The carcass of any dead animal exposed to rabies
shall, upon demand, be surrendered to law enforcement, animal control officer
or designee. Law enforcement, animal control officer, designee or veterinarian
shall direct the disposition of any animal found to be infected with rabies. No
person shall fail or refuse to surrender any animal for quarantine or
euthanasia as required herein when demand is made by law enforcement, animal
control officer or designee. (Ord. 749, 2014; Ord. 636 (part), 2006)

release of any infant wild animal kept under temporary permit which is deemed
capable of survival.
   B.   Any wild animal kept in captivity that is in human exposure must be
vaccinated against rabies. (Ord. 749, 2014; Ord. 636 (part), 2006)
6.04.055   Keeping of dangerous animals.
   A.   No person may own, harbor, or keep within the city any dangerous
animal, except according to the provisions of this section.
   B.   The owner or caretaker of a potentially dangerous animal shall keep
such animal in a proper enclosure. If a potentially dangerous animal is not in
a proper enclosure, it shall be directly accompanied by its owner or caretaker
and confined or restrained in such a manner that, after investigation by law
enforcement, animal control officer or designee, it is not a dangerous animal.
   C.   Law enforcement, animal control officer or designee may take possession
of and impound any animal suspected of being dangerous, and may hold such
animal for a necessary period of time to determine the extent of the danger
such animal poses. Law enforcement, animal control officer or designee may
dispose of any animal so determined to be dangerous.
   D.   Law enforcement, animal control officer or designee may use all
necessary means to control a dangerous animal so as not to immediately
jeopardize the health or safety of themselves or others. Law enforcement,
animal control officer or designee may enter, search and investigate premises,
take testimony from the owner and witness and seize, impound or euthanize a
dangerous animal.
   E.   At the discretion of law enforcement, animal control officer or
designee, a person may continue to own, harbor, or keep a dangerous animal only

enforcement, animal control officer or designee determines that a violation of
the containment notice has occurred, the animal shall be seized and impounded
immediately to be disposed of as set forth. The owner of the dangerous animal
is subject to any civil or criminal penalties referenced in this chapter. (Ord.
749, 2014)
6.04.060   Enforcement.
   The civil and criminal provisions of this chapter shall be enforced by those
persons or agencies designated by municipal, county or state authority. It
shall be a violation of this chapter to interfere with a humane officer in the
performance of his or her duties. (Ord. 749, 2014; Ord. 636 (part), 2006)
6.04.065   Investigation.
   It is provided that law enforcement, animal control officer or designee may
enter upon the premises where any animal is kept in a reportedly cruel, or
inhumane, manner; demand to examine such animal and to take possession of such
animal, which in their opinion, requires humane treatment or veterinary care.
Such animal in need of humane treatment, or veterinary care, shall be
impounded. Minimal veterinary care necessary shall be provided by a licensed
veterinarian, and the expenses of such care, and impoundment, shall be held as
a lien on the animal to be paid before the animal can be lawfully recovered.
The owner of such animal may regain possession upon payment of any fines
imposed, and all bills for veterinary care provided during impoundment. Such
owner shall be informed that if inhumane treatment occurs a second time, the
animal shall again be seized, and destroyed, if necessary, without being held
for three days, or if the animal is deemed not dangerous, or undesirable due to
the inhumane treatment sustained, such animal may be placed with a person
deemed to be a responsible and caring owner, or released to the custody of any
humane society to be placed for adoption to a responsible person. Under no
circumstances shall the inhumanely treated animal be returned to the former
owner, or any agent of the former owner. (Ord. 749, 2014; Ord. 636 (part),
2006)

   2.   All citations and warning tickets issued by him or her;
   3.   All investigations conducted by them concerning reported violations of
state law or this chapter regarding inhumane treatment of animal.
   C.   It shall be the duty of law enforcement, animal control officer or
designee to keep, or cause to be kept records of all animals quarantined for
rabies observation, reported cause of rabies, animal bites, and proceedings
regarding vicious dogs. (Ord. 749, 2014)
6.04.068   Redemption and destruction of impounded animals.

animal impounded under this provisions of this chapter and not reclaimed by its
owner within three days may be humanely destroyed by law enforcement, animal
control officer, designee or sold or placed in the custody of some person
deemed to be a responsible and suitable person to be the owner of such animal.
Law enforcement, animal control officer or designee may destroy any sick or
injured animal or feral cat which has been impounded, if that animal is not
wearing any rabies tag, license tag, or other identification, without holding

636 (part), 2006)
6.04.071   Disposal of dead animal.
   For the owner of a dead animal to permit it to remain un-disposed of longer
than twelve (12) hours after its death constitutes a nuisance. (Ord. 749, 2014;
Ord. 713 (part), 2012)
6.04.080   Inhuman treatment, mistreatment, torture, cruelty or neglect of
animals.
   Every person who overdrives, overloads, drives when overloaded, overworks,
or unreasonably or unnecessarily tortures, torments, deprives of necessary
sustenance, unnecessarily or cruelly beats, or wilfully and maliciously and
needlessly mutilates or kills, or carries in or upon any vehicle, or otherwise
in a cruel or inhumane manner any animal, or causes or procures it to be done,
or who, having the charge and custody of any animal, unnecessarily fails to
provide it with the proper food, proper drink or proper protection from the
elements, adequate sanitation and/or facilities, or cruelly abandons it shall
be guilty of a class 2 misdemeanor. (Ord. 749, 2014; Ord. 636 (part), 2006)

the cost of the owner. The owner is deemed to have consented to such veterinary
care as the veterinarian determines in his sole discretion is required. Any
animal impounded and not reclaimed by its owner within three days from the time

officer, law enforcement officer, and/or city employee may authorize the
licensed veterinarian to provide the minimum care of any animal; or to destroy
any sick or injured, wild, or feral animal which has been impounded if its
condition is such as to make its earlier destruction necessary or desirable.
All animals destroyed shall be destroyed in a humane manner. Any appointed
officer of the licensing authority may lawfully destroy or cause to be disposed
any animal in his charge when, in the judgment of such officer, such animal
appears to be injured, disabled, diseased past recovery, contagious toward
other animals or human, if owner of such animal cannot be located. (Ord. 749,
2014; Ord. 636 (part), 2006)
6.04.110   Penalty for animals chasing, wounding, worrying, killing pets,
livestock, domestic or wild animals.

wholesome food and water, proper shelter and protection from the weather,
veterinary care when needed to prevent suffering, and with humane care and
treatment.
   A.   If a shelter with a chain is used as a primary enclosure for a dog kept
outdoors, the chain used shall be so placed or attached that it cannot become
entangled with the chains of other dogs or any other objects. Such chain shall
be at least three times the length of the dog as measured from the tip of its
nose to the base of its tail and shall allow the dog convenient access to
shelter.
   B.   Animals shall be fed at least once each day except as otherwise might
be required to provide adequate veterinary care. The food shall be free from
contamination, be wholesome, palatable and of sufficient quantity and nutritive
value to meet the normal daily requirements for the condition and size of the
animal.
   C.   Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary
to prevent contamination and to reduce disease hazards and odors.
   D.   Any person who, as the operator of a motor vehicle, strikes a domestic
animal shall stop at once and attempt to locate the animal's owner; in the
event the owner cannot be ascertained and located such operator shall at once
report the accident to the appropriate law enforcement agency or the local
humane society. (Ord. 749, 2014; Ord. 636 (part), 2006)
6.04.130   Violation—Penalty.
   Except as otherwise provided, any person violating any provision of this
chapter shall be deemed guilty of a class 2 misdemeanor. If any violation be

chapter to any person or circumstance is held invalid or unconstitutional, the
remainder of this chapter and applicability thereof to other persons or
circumstance shall not be affected thereby. (Ord. 749, 2014; Ord. 636 (part),

Chapter 6.05
DEER FEEDING PROHIBITED
Sections:
6.05.010   Prohibition.
6.05.020   Evidence—Presumptions.
6.05.030   Removal.
6.05.040   Penalty.
6.05.050   Exceptions.
6.05.060   Severability.
6.05.010   Prohibition.
   A.   The city council finds that deer feeding by placing grain, fruit,
vegetables, nuts, hay, salt, mineral or other edible material, upon real
property for the purpose of attracting deer to eat such food source has the
effect of enticing deer from their natural habitat into an unnatural urban
environment, thereby endangering the deer, resulting in an unnatural growth of
the deer population, resulting in an unnatural loss of the deer's instinctive
avoidance of humans, resulting in reliance by deer upon such food source, and
also endangering persons and domestic animals, and resulting in damage to
property.
   B.   No person shall feed or allow the feeding of deer. For the purpose of
this section, feeding shall mean provision of one-half cubic foot or more of
grain, fruit, vegetables, nuts, hay, salt, mineral or other edible material,
either on the ground or at a height of less than five feet above the ground, in
a manner that attracts deer on a regular basis. Living food sources such as
fruit trees and other vegetation, shall not be considered as deer feeding.

6.05.020   Evidence—Presumptions.
   A.   There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the following acts are for
the purpose of feeding deer.
   1.   The placement of one-half cubic foot or more of grain, fruit,
vegetables, nuts, hay, salt, mineral or other edible material, either on the
ground or at a height of less than five feet above the ground.

the placement of grain, mineral, fruit, plant, salt, vegetable, or other
material in an aggregate quantity of greater than one-half cubic foot or more
was placed not less than five feet above the ground and was not accessible to
deer, or that the unnatural food source was placed in good faith for the
purpose of feeding domestic livestock or pets by or at the request of a person
owning or having responsibility for such domestic livestock or pets, or that
the unnatural food source was placed in good faith for a purpose other than
attracting deer or other wildlife and that the attraction of deer is only an
incidental result. (Ord. 636 (part), 2006)

to the property that prevent deer from having access to or feeding from the
device. Failure to remove such a device or to make such modifications within
twenty-four (24) hours after notice from the city shall constitute a separate
violation of this chapter. (Ord. 636 (part), 2006)

relating to the reselling of cemetery lots, the city shall have the right to
discontinue all rights granted to a purchaser of any lot after a period of
thirty (30) years from the date of sale thereof, should the city finance
officer, upon investigation, determine that the purchaser or owner thereof has
not used the lot, or any part thereof, that the owner is deceased and that the
lot will not likely be used as a burial place for the owner or purchaser or any
members of his or her family. In the event that any such lot is to be
reclaimed, inquiry shall be made to ascertain the names and addresses of the
heirs or any of them, which can be obtained by the making of reasonable
inquiry, and notice shall be given to the heirs, by mail, of the intention of
the city to reclaim the property, and of the fact that the money will be
deposited as hereinafter provided in this section. Notice and transfer shall be

located or not, the original cost of the lot, as paid by the owner or
purchaser, shall be held in trust by the city until such time as proof
satisfactory to the city is made by the heirs of the deceased owner of the
right to the proceeds. In case no heir of a deceased owner is located, notice
of the reclaiming of the lot and the deposit of the money shall be published
once a week for three (3) successive weeks in the official newspaper in the

(30) days thereafter to purchase the property on the basis of the regular
selling price by the city of lots in the same section or block. If the option
is not exercised by the city, the owner or purchaser may then sell to any other
person. However, no lot shall be sold for a price greater than that originally
paid to the city for that lot. No transfer or assignment of any lot, or
interest therein, shall be valid without the consent of the city finance
officer. No person shall buy or sell any lot within the cemetery for purposes
of speculation. In the event any lot is purchased by the city, pursuant to the

customer’s previous record of prompt payment to the city for utility services.
Letters of reference from other utility companies are not acceptable in lieu of
utility deposit.
   C.   A delinquent account deposit of one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be
required in addition if the customer has had prior service with the city, and
had such service disconnected for nonpayment, or if collection efforts such as
small claims action or collection agency action were taken, or if the customer
had four late utility payments (not consecutive) with any twelve (12) month
period.

account and interest earned thereon shall be the property of the city. At such
time as water service shall be terminated, the city finance officer shall
promptly refund any such deposit to the water customer; provided, however, that
all accounts are paid in full. In the event that the customer shall fail to pay
his or her utility billings to the city before the same may be delinquent, then
the Custer City finance officer shall have the right to withdraw such trust
fund and apply to any obligation. This remedy shall be in addition to any other
remedies the city shall have for the collection of such moneys and the right to
terminate such service upon nonpayment by the customer. (Ord. 681, 2011; Ord.
652 (part), 2008; Ord. 620 (part), 2005: Ord. 603 (part), 2004)
13.04.300   Account must be paid before water turned on.

by ordinance adopted by the Custer City common council. The customer shall be
required to remit the minimum monthly fee for the periods of time that the
structure is not occupied.
   B.   Customers who are seasonal in nature, less than year-round service,
shall be required to remit the minimum monthly fee for the periods of time that
service is discontinued, and shall remit the regular fee for actual consumption
for the periods of time that service is in use.
   C.   The city council shall establish water and sewer rates that will
generate the amount of money needed to pay for the proportional amount of the
total water and wastewater budget that reflects the percentage of water and
effluent (sewer) used by the collective commercial community and the collective
residential community.
   D.   Abandonment of Service. Abandonment of service requires the system to
be shutoff in conjunction with Section
13.04.270 (notice for discontinuance required) with the written statement
(form) being filed on the property with the Custer County register of deeds
office. When this procedure is completed, the minimum monthly utility charge
will be waived. At the time the property owner decides to have the utility
lines reactivated, there will be the normal and customary charges as associated
with Section
13.04.080 (issuance of permits). (Ord. 620 (part), 2005: Ord. 603 (part), 2004)
13.04.320   Payment and reading due dates.
   A.   It is the responsibility of all customers, except those customers that
have been supplied radio read meters, to remit the amount due for the prior
month's charges for water services per the billing card and to read, report,
and return their water meter reading to the Custer City finance office, between
the first and the eleventh day of each month on the billing card.
   B.   All bills or charges for water shall be paid at the Custer City finance
office on or before the eleventh day of the month, and if not so paid, the
account shall become delinquent and a ten-dollar ($10.00) penalty fee added
thereto. If the eleventh day of the month falls on the weekend, payment will be
due the preceding Friday by five p.m. Delinquent accounts are further addressed
in Section
13.04.330. Customers shall be entitled to make written arrangements for late
payments, with the approval of the finance officer, for reasons such as, but
not limited to, being out of town or seasonal accounts, medical reasons or a
death in the immediate family, and a late payment fee shall not be charged or
may be removed. A late payment fee of ten dollars ($10.00) shall be assessed to
those accounts that have made payment arrangements for charges that are
delinquent and not paid in accordance with such payment arrangements.
   C.   Failure of any customer to make the required monthly water meter
reading report to the city finance office shall have their usage estimated and
a fifteen-dollar ($15.00) penalty fee added thereto. (Ord. 620 (part), 2005:
Ord. 603 (part), 2004)
13.04.330   Delinquent accounts.
   A.   Payments not received by the city finance office prior to the eleventh
day of each month shall be considered delinquent and subject to disconnection.
Per city code, "friendly reminder notices" are prepared on the twelfth of each
month, or the following work day, on unpaid account balances over twenty
dollars ($20.00) reminding utility customers of the delinquent balance and the
scheduled shutoff date. The "friendly reminder notice" is a two-part form and
the original will be mailed to the customer by first class mail and the second
part will be retained in the city finance office. The "friendly reminder
notice" allows ten (10) days for payment. The ten (10) days may be altered due
to the fact the city does not disconnect services on Fridays, weekends, a day
preceding a holiday, or a holiday; disconnection of services will then be
scheduled for the next work day following. Payment(s) arrangements are accepted
on disconnect notices if paid in full prior to the next utility billing date. A
"final utility notice" of disconnection shall be completed and signed by the
city administrator, the finance officer, or mayor for all accounts to be
disconnected. The "final utility notice" shall be hand-delivered to the owner
or resident the day before the scheduled shutoff or if no person is present to
receive the "final utility notice," the "notice" shall be posted on the main
entrance door of such property. A late payment fee of ten dollars ($10.00)
shall be assessed to those accounts that have received a hand-delivered “final
utility notice”. Payment on the account is due prior to one p.m. on the
scheduled shutoff day. If payment is not received prior to one p.m. on the
scheduled shutoff day, water department personnel will disconnect services
immediately. Water department personnel cannot make arrangements of any type
with the customer at the property. Any such arrangement may only be made with
the city finance office in writing.
   B.   Once the services have been disconnected for nonpayment,
reestablishment of services with the city requires the following:
   1.   The account must be paid in full (zero balance);
   2.   The utility customer must pay a turn-on fee of twenty-five dollars
($25.00), if restored during normal water department working hours of seven
a.m. to three p.m., Monday through Friday;
   3.   The customer will be required to pay a seventy-five-dollar ($75.00) fee
per turn-on, if services are restored after normal water department working
hours of seven a.m. to three p.m., Monday through Friday.
   C.   Appeals on disputed charges shall be addressed to the Custer City
finance officer, by written notice, between the hours of eight a.m. and five
p.m., Monday through Friday. The finance officer is authorized to correct any
errors in the account. The customer shall be given an opportunity to appeal the
decision of the finance officer if the appeal is denied at this level. The next
step to appeal disputed charges shall be the city administrator or mayor; if
there is still no resolution, then it will be brought before the Custer City
common council at its next regularly scheduled meeting and service shall be
continued until the appeal is heard.
   D.   Payment plan arrangements for past due accounts will be:
   Residential—current bill amount in full each month plus a monthly percentage
of the delinquent amount large enough to settle the account within the maximum
time limit of one year;
   Commercial—current bill amount in full each month plus a monthly minimum of
ten (10) percent of the delinquent amount. Failure to comply with the payment
plan arrangement will result in immediate shutoff without notice. (Ord. 715,

13.04.340   Water customers outside the city limits.
   All customers of water supplied by the Custer City waterworks outside the
corporate limits shall be governed by all rules, regulations and ordinances in
effect within the city concerning the same, and shall be charged the rate of
one and one-half times the rate for in-town customers in the same customer
class category as determined by the city council. (Ord. 620 (part), 2005: Ord.
603 (part), 2004)
13.04.350   Privately owned wells.
   Whereas the city is dependent upon a number of shallow wells for its
municipal water supply, and whereas the water supply for the city is extremely
limited, particularly in years of drought, and whereas any other privately
owned wells within the city would acquire water from the same water source, and
any private withdrawal from any such private well would withdraw water needed
for the municipal water system, and further, that it is necessary to protect
the municipal water supply and distribution system from contamination resulting
from cross-connections with privately owned wells, and all with the purpose of
insuring equitable distribution of clean water and its related costs to include
water for fire protection to the residences and businesses of the city:
   A.   No new privately owned wells will be permitted within the city, except
as follows:
   1.   Wells used exclusively for heat transfer systems (heat pumps);
   2.   Wells for domestic water supply or purposes when municipal water
service is not reasonably available.
   B.   No property or facility will be permitted to be served simultaneously
by a privately owned well and the municipal water supply for domestic service.
Privately owned wells are permitted for outside irrigation systems and heat
transfer systems provided they are physically separated from the domestic
service with no pipes, valves or fittings connecting the two systems together.
All properties and facilities that are served domestic water from a privately
owned well following the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter will
be permitted to continue in service, but all physical connection to the
municipal water system must be severed.
   C.   All properties and facilities currently receiving domestic, irrigation
or heat pump water from privately owned wells, and all future wells, whether
for outside irrigation or heat transfer systems, shall have no pipe, valve or
fitting connecting any of these systems with the municipal water system.
Privately owned wells and the municipal water system must have no physical
connection.
   D.   When an existing privately owned well is discontinued from service by
the owner for a period of ninety (90) days, the well will be permanently
discontinued and will not be permitted to operate again. Discontinuance does
not mean merely turning off a valve or faucet. It is intended to mean that the
owner of the well had demonstrated or otherwise indicated no further use of the
well and does not intend to resume its use. (Ord. 603 (part), 2004)
13.04.360   Review of each customer's water service charge.
   The city shall review the total annual cost of operation and maintenance as
well as each customer's water contribution percentage not less often than every
two years and will revise the water system charge as necessary to assure equity
of the service charge system established in this chapter and to assure that
sufficient funds are obtained to adequately operate and maintain the water
treatment works. (Ord. 603 (part), 2004)

average daily volume of wastewater shall exclude infiltration and inflow. The
public works director, or its city engineer, shall determine for each customer
or customer class the average daily poundage of five-day twenty (20) degree
centigrade biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) discharged to the wastewater system
which shall then be divided by the average daily poundage of all five-day BOD
discharged to the wastewater system to determine such customer's BOD
contribution percentage.
   B.   The public works director, or its city engineer, shall determine for
each customer or customer class the average daily total suspended solids (TSS)
poundage discharged to the wastewater system which shall then be divided by the
average daily poundage of all TSS discharged to the wastewater system, to
determine such customer's TSS contribution percentage. The volume contribution
percentage, BOD contribution percentage and TSS contribution percentage for
each customer or customer class shall be multiplied by the annual operation and
maintenance costs for wastewater treatment of the total volume flow, total
five-day twenty (20) degree centigrade BOD and total TSS, respectively. (Ord.

   The public works director, or its city engineer, will assess a surcharge
rate for all nonresidential customers discharging wastes with BOD and TSS
strengths greater than the average residential customer. Such customers will be
assessed a surcharge sufficient to cover the cost of treating their above-
normal strength wastes. Normal strength wastes are considered to be two hundred
fifty (250) ppm BOD and two hundred fifty (250) ppm TSS. The surcharge rate
structure for such above-normal strength waste dischargers is attached in
Section
13.20.050. (Ord. 603 (part), 2004)
13.20.050   Surcharge rate schedule for above-normal strength wastes.
   The public works director, or its city engineer, has determined that the
average total suspended solids (TSS) and five-day biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD) daily loadings for the average residential customer are two hundred fifty
(250) ppm BOD and two hundred fifty (250) ppm TSS. The public works director,
or its city engineer, has assessed a surcharge rate for all nonresidential
customers discharging wastes with BOD and TSS strengths greater than the
average residential customer. The surcharge will be sufficient to cover the
costs of treating such customers' above-normal strength wastes. Such customers
will pay an additional service charge of twenty-five cents ($0.25) per one
thousand (1,000) gallons for each twenty-five (25) ppm over two hundred fifty
(250) ppm of BOD and twenty-five cents ($0.25) per one thousand (1,000) gallons
for each twenty-five (25) ppm over two hundred fifty (250) ppm TSS. (Ord. 603
(part), 2004)
13.20.060   Determining each customer's wastewater service charge.
   Each nonresidential customer's wastewater treatment cost contributions as
determined in Sections 13.20.030 and 13.20.040 shall be added together to
determine such customer's annual wastewater service charge. Residential
customers may be considered to be one class of customer and an equitable
service charge may be determined for each customer based on an estimate of the
total water consumption of this class of customer. (Ord. 603 (part), 2004)
13.20.070   Wastewater facilities replacement fund.
   A reserve fund called the wastewater facilities replacement fund is
established within the wastewater utility fund for the purpose of providing
sufficient funds to be expended for obtaining and installing equipment,
accessories and appurtenances during the useful life (twenty (20) years) of the
wastewater treatment facilities necessary to maintain the capacity and
performance for which such facilities are designed and constructed (see Section

sixty dollars ($58,360.00) per year obtained from the wastewater utility fund
at the end of each fiscal year. (Ord. 603 (part), 2004)
13.20.090   Payment of the customer's wastewater service charge and penalties.
   Each customer shall read his water meter between the first and eleventh day
of each month and shall pay his monthly wastewater service charge in
conjunction with his total monthly utility billing. The city shall assess a
five-dollar ($5.00) penalty if the payment is not received by the city on or
before the eleventh day of each month. Each customer shall be notified by mail
of the delinquent account along with the attachment of penalty. After
notification and if the delinquent account is not paid within ten (10) days,
the city shall disconnect water service to the customer and/or stop wastewater
service to the property. (Ord. 603 (part), 2004)
13.20.100   Review of each customer's wastewater service charge.
   The city shall review the total annual cost of operation and maintenance as
well as each customer's wastewater contribution percentage not less often than
every two years and will revise the water system charge as necessary to assure
equity of the service charge system established in this chapter and to assure
that sufficient funds are obtained to adequately operate and maintain the
wastewater treatment works. (Ord. 603 (part), 2004)
13.20.110   Notification.
   The wastewater treatment services budget shall be published annually in the
city's legal newspaper to serve as notice to each customer of the costs
associated with wastewater collection and treatment in determination of
customer charges. (Ord. 603 (part), 2004)
13.20.120   Wastes prohibited from being discharged to the wastewater treatment
system.
   A.   The discharge of any waters containing toxic or poisonous solids,
liquids or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly, or by interaction with
other wastes, to contaminate the sludge of any municipal systems, or to injure

residence, mobilehome, or any other type of residence, if such residence is
served by an independent connection to the municipal water and wastewater
system of the city.
   B.   Commercial, multiple-family residence, and mobilehome parks are
considered to be one class of customer. For the purpose of this section, a
multiple-family residence includes duplexes, four-plexes, apartment buildings,
and any structure or series of structures that contain multiple residential
units that collectively discharge their domestic waste into a single,
independent connection to the municipal wastewater system of the city. For the
purposes of this section, a mobilehome park is two or more mobilehomes that
collectively discharge their domestic waste into a single, independent
connection to the municipal sewer system. For the purpose of this section, all
other customers not specifically designated in subsections A and B of this

the corporate boundaries of the city and whose water supply did not originate
from the city's municipal water system shall be charged a fee for the use of
the municipal wastewater system. This fee shall be based on the proportion of
the flow that the customer generates in relation to the total flow of the
system. The fee shall be this percentage applied to the current year's total
operation and maintenance budget for the city wastewater treatment and
collection system.

   The Legislature of the State of South Dakota has in (statutes) SDCL 9-36 and
7-18-14 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council of
Custer City, South Dakota, does ordain as follows:
   The city of Custer City elects to comply with the requirements of the
National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as amended). The National
Flood Insurance Program, established in the aforesaid act, provides that areas
of the town having a special flood hazard be identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency and that floodplain management measures be applied
in such flood hazard areas. The National Flood Insurance Program was broadened
and modified with the passage of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 and
other legislative measures. It was further modified by the National Flood
Insurance Reform Act of 1994. The National Flood Insurance Program is
administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a component of the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security. (Ord. 710 (part), 2012)
15.16.012   Findings of fact.
   A.   The flood hazard areas of Highway 385 Tributary, French Creek and
Laughing Water Creek are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss
of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety
and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by
the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous
to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood proofed or
otherwise protected from flood damage. (Ord. 710 (part), 2012: Ord. 247 § 1.2,
1987)
15.16.013   Statement of purpose.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life and health;
   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   G.   Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area. (Ord. 710 (part), 2012: Ord. 247 § 1.3, 1987)
15.16.014   Methods of reducing flood losses.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   D.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   E.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 710 (part), 2012: Ord. 247 § 1.4, 1987)
15.16.020   Definitions.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   “Area of future-conditions flood hazard” means the land area that would be
inundated by the 1-percent-annual- chance (100-year) flood based on future-
conditions hydrology.
   “Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO
zone on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one (1) percent or
greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one (1) to three (3)
feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding
is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   “Area of special flood-related erosion hazard” is the land within a
community which is most likely to be subject to severe flood-related erosion
losses. The area may be designated as Zone E on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map
(FHBM). After the detailed evaluation of the special flood-related erosion
hazard area; in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone E may be further
refined.
   “Area of special flood hazard” is the land in the flood plain within a
community subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of flooding in any
given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the FHBM. After detailed
ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the flood
insurance rate map, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE,
A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, or V1-30, VE, or V. For
purposes of these regulations, the term "special flood hazard area" is
synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard".
   “Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
   “Base flood elevation (BFE)” is the water surface elevation of the one (1)
percent annual chance flood. The height in relation to mean sea level expected

park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the
lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a
minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either

normally dry land areas from:
   (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
   (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (3)   Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding as
defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this definition and are akin to a river of
liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when
earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the
current.
   (b)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other
body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents
of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an
unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe
storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this definition.
   “Flood elevation determination” means a determination by the administrator
of the water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the flood level
that has a one percent or greater chance of occurrence in any given year.

level for purposes of flood plain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of
the watershed.
   “Functionally dependent use” means a use which cannot perform its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The
term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for
the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship
repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related
manufacturing facilities.
   “Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

   (a)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
   (b)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district;

Interior or
   (2)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved
programs.
   “Letter of Map Amendment” is an official revision by letter to an effective
NFIP map. A LOMA amends the currently effective FEMA map and establishes that a
specific property is not located in a special flood hazard area.
   “Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill” is an official revision by letter to
an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F states FEMA's determination concerning whether
a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
   “Conditional Letter of Map Revision” is FEMA's formal review and comment as
to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum NFIP floodplain

levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of
Ch. 15.16.
   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
   “Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous
parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or
sale.
   “Map” means the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) for a community issued by the agency.
   “Mean sea level” means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance
Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to
which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are
referenced.
   “New construction” means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates,
structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is
later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
floodplain management purposes, new construction means structures for which the
start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   “New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site

truck; and
   (d)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   “Regulatory floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a
designated height.
   “Special flood hazard area”: see "area of special flood hazard".
   “Special hazard area” means an area having special flood, mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow), or flood-related erosion hazards, and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as
Zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, AH, VO,
V1-30, VE, V, M, or E.
   “Start of construction” (for other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)),
includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   “Structure” means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed
building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above
ground, as well as a manufactured home. “Structure”, for insurance purposes,
means:
   (1)   A building with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured
roof, that is affixed to a permanent site;
   (2)   A manufactured home ("a manufactured home," also known as a mobile
home, is a structure: built on a permanent chassis, transported to its site in
one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation); or
   (3)   A travel trailer without wheels built on a chassis and affixed to a
permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community's floodplain
management and building ordinances or laws.
   For the latter purpose, "structure" does not mean a recreational vehicle or
a park trailer or other similar vehicle, except as described in paragraph (3)
of this definition, or a gas or liquid storage tank.
   “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   “Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
   (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or
   (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure."
   “Variance” means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a flood
plain management regulation.
   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with the community's flood plain management regulations. A
structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR 60.3(b)(5),
(c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
   “Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of
floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the flood plains of coastal or
riverine areas. (Ord. 710 (part), 2012: Ord. 247 § 2.0, 1987)
15.16.030   General provisions.
15.16.031   Lands to which this chapter applies.
   The chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of Custer City. (Ord. 710 (part), 2012: Ord. 247 § 3.1, 1987)
15.16.032   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.

   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use
changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
applicable regulations. (Ord. 710 (part), 2012: Ord. 247 § 3.3, 1987)
15.16.035   Abrogation and greater restrictions.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 710
(part), 2012: Ord. 247 § 3.4, 1987)
15.16.036   Interpretation.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall
be:
   1.   considered as minimum requirements;
   2.   liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   3.   deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes. (Ord. 710 (part), 2012: Ord. 247 § 3.5, 1987)
15.16.037   Warning and disclaimer or liability.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes.
   This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood
hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the community
or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder. (Ord. 710 (part), 2012: Ord. 247 § 3.6, 1987)

be affected. (Ord. 710 (part), 2012)
15.16.040   Administration.
15.16.041   Designation of the floodplain administrator.
   The city planner is hereby appointed the floodplain administrator to
administer and implement the provisions of this chapter and other appropriate
sections of 44 CFR (National Flood Insurance Program Regulations) pertaining to
floodplain management. (Ord. 879, 2023; Ord. 710 (part), 2012)
15.16.042   Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator.
   Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include,
but not be limited to, the following:
   1.   Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining to
the provisions of this chapter.
   2.   Review permit applications to determine whether a proposed building
site, including the placement of manufactured homes, will be reasonably safe
from flooding.
   3.   Review, approve or deny all applications for development permits
required by adoption of this chapter.

permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental
agencies (including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is required.
   5.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions)
the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.
   6.   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state
coordinating agency which is South Dakota Game Fish and Parks, prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   7.   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated
portion of any watercourse is maintained.
   8.   When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with
this chapter, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available from a
federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this
chapter.
   9.   When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain
administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and
AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.
   10.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain
development in Zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the community's FIRM which increases the
water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot, provided that
the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA
(Conditional Letter of Map Revision). (Ord. 710 (part), 2012)
15.16.043   Permit procedures.
   Application for a development permit shall be presented to the floodplain
administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include, but not be limited
to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions, and
elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and proposed structures,
including the placement of manufactured homes, and the location of the
foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard.
   Additionally, the following information is required:
   1.   Elevation (in relation to mean sea level), of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures;
   2.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential

will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
   5.   Maintain a record of all such information.
   Approval or denial of a development permit by the floodplain administrator
shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the following
relevant factors:
   1.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
   2.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
   3.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
   4.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
   5.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
   6.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems;
   7.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site;
   8.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
   9.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or
erosion damage, for the proposed use;
   10.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for
that area. (Ord. 710 (part), 2012: Ord. 510, 1999; Ord. 508 (part), 1999; Ord.
247 § 4.1, 1987)
15.16.044   Variance procedures.
   The appeal board for this chapter shall be the common council of the City of
Custer City. Said appeal board shall hear and render judgment on requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter.
   1.   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may
appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
   2.   The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and the State Office of Emergency Management upon issuing a
variance.
   3.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one- half acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Section
15.16.043 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
   4.   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter.
   5.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   6.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   7.   Prerequisites for granting variances:
   a)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   b)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
   1)   showing a good and sufficient cause;
   2)   a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
   3)   a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   c)   Any application wherein a variance is granted, the applicant shall be
given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the
lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   8.   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that:
   a)   the criteria outlined in Article 4, Section D(1)-(9) are met, and
   b)   the structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety. (Ord. 710 (part), 2012: Ord. 247 § 4.4-2, 1987)
15.16.045   Map revisions.
   A CLOMR is required only for those projects that will:
   1.   BFE/no floodway (demonstrate <1.0 ft increase)
   a.   A project on a stream or river that has been studied through detailed
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses and for which base flood elevations (BFEs)
have been specified, but a floodway has not been designated. If the developer/
property owner/community proposes to allow development that would result in
more than a 1.0 foot increase in the BFE, a CLOMR must first be obtained.
   b.   44 CFR 60.3 (c)(10): Result in an increase in the base flood water-
surface elevation (WSEL) of greater than 1.00 foot for streams with BFEs
specified but no regulatory floodway designated.
   2.   BFE/floodway (no-rise)
   a.   The second situation requiring a CLOMR is for a project on a stream or
river for which detailed analyses have been conducted and BFEs and a floodway
have been designated. If the community proposes to allow development totally or
partially within the floodway that would result in any (greater than 0.0 foot)
increase in the BFE, a CLOMR must be obtained.
   b.   44 CFR 60.3 (d)(3): Result in any base flood WSEL increase from
proposed construction within a regulatory floodway.
   LOMRs are required under 44 CFR 65.3. (Ord. 710 (part), 2012)
15.16.050   Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
15.16.051   General standards.
   In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required

them or contamination from them during flooding. (Ord. 710 (part), 2012: Ord.
498 (part), 1998; Ord. 491 (part), 1998: Ord. 247 § 5.1, 1987)
15.16.052   Specific standards.
   In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has
been provided the following provisions are required:
   1.   Residential construction - new construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement),
elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation. A registered professional

improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one foot
above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific

proofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.
   3.   Enclosures - new construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which
are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
   a)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be
provided.

to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
   b)   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i)
outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured
home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a
result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest
floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation
and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
   c)   In A1-30, AH, and AE Zones, require that manufactured homes to be
placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park to be
elevated so that the lowest floor is at or above the base flood elevation; OR
the chassis is supported by reinforced piers no less than 36 inches in height
above grade and securely anchored.
   5.   Recreational vehicles - Require that recreational vehicles placed on
sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either:
   a)   be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,
   b)   be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
   c)   meet the permit requirements of Article IV, Section C, and the
elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" of this section.
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or
jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. (Ord. 710
(part), 2012: Ord. 491 (part), 1998; Ord. 247 § 5.2, 1987)
15.16.053   Standards for subdivision proposals.
   1.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with the provisions of this chapter.
   2.   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development
permit requirements of this chapter.
   3.   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is
lesser.
   4.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazards.
   5.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage. (Ord. 710 (part), 2012)
15.16.054   Floodways.
   Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in
15.16.030, are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of flood waters
which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply:
   1.   Designate a regulatory floodway which will not increase the base flood
level more than one (1) foot.
   2.   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   3.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V in this chapter.
   4.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the

management regulations that meet or exceed the minimum standards of Section 60.
"These regulations must include effective enforcement provisions." In
accordance with Section 60.1(b) of CFR 44, Chapter 1, of the NFIP regulations,
"These regulations must be legally-enforceable, applied uniformly throughout
the community to all privately and publicly owned land within flood-prone (i.e.
mudflow) or flood-related erosion areas, and the community must provide that
the regulations take precedence over less restrictive conflicting local laws,
ordinances or codes."
   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter
by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a Class 2 misdemeanor for each violation. In addition, any person
violating this chapter shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Custer City from taking such
other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord.
710 (part), 2012)
15.16.056   Certification.
   It is hereby found and declared by Custer City that severe flooding has
occurred in the past within its jurisdiction and will certainly occur within

prior to commencement of construction of improvements or before the sale of any
lots therein, by a written instrument declaring the same to be vacated, duly
executed, acknowledged or approved and recorded in the same office with the
plat to be vacated. The execution and recording of such writing shall operate
to destroy the force and effect of the recording of the plat so vacated and to
divest all public rights in the streets, alleys, commons and public grounds
laid out or described in the plat. In cases where any lots have been sold, the
plat may be vacated, as provided in this chapter, by all the owners of lots in
the plat joining in the execution of the writing aforesaid.
   B.   Any part of a plat may be vacated under the provisions and conditions
of subsection A of this section, provided such vacating does not abridge or
destroy any of the rights and privileges of other proprietors in the plat.
Nothing contained in this subsection shall authorize the closing or obstructing
of any public highways laid out according to law.
   C.   When any part of a plat shall be vacated as aforesaid, the proprietors
of the lots so vacated may enclose the streets, alleys and public grounds
adjoining the lots in equal proportions.
   D.   The register of deeds, in whose office the plats are recorded, shall
write in plain, legible letters across the part of the plat so vacated the word
“vacated” and also make a reference on the plat to the volume and page in which
the instrument of vacation is recorded.
   E.   No vacation of a plat will be granted after construction of
improvements has commenced. Ord. 568 (part), 2002: Ord. 433 (part), 1995)

lots or parcels for the purpose of transfer of ownership or building
development, whether future or immediate. There shall be established two
categories of rural subdivision as follows:
   Class A Rural Subdivision. A parcel, divided into lots that are five acres
or more in size, and is not served by central sewer and/or central water, that
is for residential purposes, shall be deemed a Class A rural subdivision.
   Class B Rural Subdivision. A parcel, divided into lots that are two acres or
more in size, and is less than five acres, and not served by central sewer and/
or central water, that is for residential purposes, shall be deemed a Class B
rural subdivision.
   A parcel divided into lots of two acres or less, or a parcel served by
central sewer and central water, shall not be deemed a rural subdivision and
shall be reviewed under the standards as set forth in sections 16.20 and 16.24
of this title. (Ord. 554 (part), 2002)
16.18.020   Purpose.
   To provide areas of low density residential development where urban services
(i.e. central water and sewer) are not available and the extension of these
services are unlikely. Adequate provision for the supply of water and disposal
of sewage shall be documented prior to approval of rural subdivision. Where
rural subdivisions are allowed, minimum improvements required are the same as
those required by the city’s minimum subdivision standards, except for those
exceptions/requirements established in this chapter. (Ord. 554 (part), 2002)

that will adequately represent the property and can be readable. The planning
administrator shall determine from the layout plan whether the rural
subdivision requirements shall apply.
   B.   If the layout plan meets the criteria of a rural subdivision, a
subdivision plat shall be submitted in accordance with Section
16.08.010 of this code.
   C.   Whenever a lot or lots are platted as a rural subdivision and are
subsequently replatted and do not meet the criteria for a rural subdivision,
all procedures and public improvements, as required by this title, shall be met
including the construction of required public facilities. (Ord. 554 (part),
2002)

16.19.040   Procedure.
16.19.010   Purpose.
   The purpose of this chapter is to allow parcels to be replatted into five or
fewer lots without being subject to the procedural provisions of the full
subdivision regulations of this title.
   A.   The minor plat procedure is to combine all of the requirements of the
preliminary plat and final plat into one plat review period.
   B.   This exemption from the procedural requirements shall in no manner
constitute an exemption from any of the design standards or requirements
outlined in the subdivision regulations.
   C.   Applicability of the minor plat procedure to a specific case shall be
determined by the criteria set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 569 (part), 2002)
16.19.020   Criteria.
   A.   No minor plat shall involve at any stage of the procedure the creation
of more than five lots or parcels.
   B.   No property involved or created by a minor plat shall be involved in a
subsequent minor plat procedure for a period of one year from the date of
filing of the original minor plat procedure.
   C.   No minor plat shall be approved in any case in which the extension of
public water, sewer or streets or any other physical improvement (excluding the
installation of public sidewalks) is required by the subdivision regulations of
this title.
   D.   No minor plat shall be approved in any case in which a variance to the
subdivision ordinance has been applied for in accordance with
Chapter 16.28 of this code.
   E.   No minor plat shall be approved unless it complies with all existing
city land use regulations, the adopted comprehensive plan and its policies, and
the adopted zoning ordinance.
   F.   No minor plat shall be approved unless it complies with all applicable
local, state, and federal policies and laws. (Ord. 569 (part), 2002)
16.19.030   Application requirements.
   A.   The applicant for a minor plat must submit five copies and an 8.5 by 11
inch copy of the proposed minor plat to the planning administrator.
   B.   An accurate survey of the existing parcel(s) in the proposed minor plat
shall be prepared by a state- registered land surveyor and submitted by the
applicant to the planning administrator.
   C.   A topographic map with contour intervals of not more than five feet
shall be required, unless the public works director deems such a topographic
map unnecessary in the overall consideration of the request and intent of this
title.
   D.   The applicant is required to submit all information that is normally
required with a plat application according to this title. (Ord. 569 (part),
2002)
16.19.040   Procedure.
   A.   The city planning commission shall review the minor plat to see if it
conforms with the minimum standards and requirements outlined in Chapters 16.08
through 16.24. After due consideration by the city planning commission, the
commission shall transmit copies of the minor plat to the city council,
together with its recommendations within sixty (60) days after receipt thereof
by the city. The recommendations shall include approval, disapproval or
suggestions for modification and the reasons therefor, and a discussion of the
effect of the minor plat on the comprehensive plan. The recommendations shall
be of an advisory nature only. If the city planning commission does not act
within sixty (60) days, the minor plat shall be deemed to have received a
favorable recommendation in all respects and shall receive due consideration by
the city council at its next regularly schedule meeting unless the applicant
agrees to an extension.
   B.   After due consideration of the minor plat, the city council shall
approve, disapprove or modify the recommendations of the city planning
commission, and may impose those requirements or grant those variances in
conformance with this title deemed necessary and appropriate for final approval
by the city council. The final plat shall be approved or disapproved within
ninety (90) days after receipt thereof by the city, unless the applicant agrees
to an extension; otherwise the plat shall be deemed approved and a certificate
to this effect shall be issued by the city council upon demand. (Ord. 569

16.20.010   General.
   A.   Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used
safely for building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire,
flood, erosion or other menace. If, following adequate investigation, conducted
by all public agencies concerned, it is determined that land to be subdivided
cannot be used without endangering the health, safety, welfare or prosperity of
the community or would necessitate an excessive expenditure of public financial
resources for sewage and water facilities, other public facilities and streets,
then the subdivision plat shall not be approved unless the subdivider
formulates adequate methods for meeting such problems.
   B.   All required improvements shall be constructed or installed to conform
to the provisions of this title and city specifications. (Ord. 433 (part),
1995)
16.20.020   Streets.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets
shall conform to the comprehensive plan and shall be considered in their
relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to
public convenience and safety and in their appropriate relation to the proposed
uses of the land to be served by such streets.
   A.   Street Extensions. The street layout of the proposed subdivision shall
provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of streets and alleys
already existing in areas being subdivided. Where, at the determination of the
city council, it is desirable to provide street access to adjoining properties,
proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundaries of such
properties. Where the city council deems it necessary, such dead-end streets
shall be provided with a temporary turnaround having a radius of at least fifty
(50) feet. The street system for the proposed subdivision shall provide for
extending existing streets at the same or greater width, but in no case shall
street extensions of less width than the minimum width required in these
regulations for a street in its category.
   B.   Dedication of Right-of-Way for New Streets. The dedication of right-of-
way for new streets measured from lot line to lot line shall be as shown on the
comprehensive plan, or, if not shown thereon, shall meet the following
standards:
 
Street Type     Minimum Dedicated Right-of-Way Width (feet)
Parkway         150
Arterial        66
Collector       66
Minor           50
Marginal access 50
Alleys          30
 
   All streets classified as arterial streets by the comprehensive plan shall
have all points of access streets approved by the city council. Marginal access
streets may be required by the city council for subdivision fronting on
arterial streets.
   C.   Dedication of Right-of-Way for Existing Streets. Subdivisions platted
along existing streets shall dedicate additional right-of-way if necessary to
meet the minimum street width requirements set forth on the preceding list. The
entire minimum right-of-way width shall be dedicated where the subdivision is
on both sides of an existing street. When the subdivision is located on only
one side of an existing street, one-half of the required right-of-way width,
measured from the centerline of existing roadway, shall be dedicated.
Dedication of one half of the right-of- way for proposed streets along the
boundaries of land proposed for subdivision shall be prohibited.
   D.   Intersections. Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at an
angle of ninety (90) degrees and no intersection shall be at an angle of less
than eighty (80) degrees. Street curb intersections shall be rounded by radii
of at least twenty (20) feet. When the smallest angle of street intersection is
less than eighty (80) degrees, the city council may require curb radii of
greater length. Wherever necessary to permit the construction of a curb having
a desirable radius without reducing the sidewalk at a street corner to less
than normal width, the property line at such street corner shall be rounded or
otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such curb construction. No lot or
other parcel of land which abuts on and has access to either a collector or a
minor street shall have a service drive, curb cut or other means of access to
an arterial street within seventy-five (75) feet of the right-of-way of any
street which intersects such arterial meet on the side on which such lot or
parcel is located.
   E.   Horizontal and Vertical Street Curves. A tangent at least one hundred
(100) feet long shall be introduced between reverse curb on arterial and
collector streets. Where there is a deflection angle of more than ten (10)
degrees in the alignment of a street, a curve with a radius adequate to insure
safe sight distance shall be made. The minimum radii of curves shall be:
 
Street Type Minimum Curve Radius (feet)
Arterial    300
Collector   300
Minor       100
 
   Every change in grade shall be connected by a vertical curve constructed so
as to afford a minimum sight distance of two hundred (200) feet, said sight
distance being measured from a driver’s eyes, which are assumed to be four and
one-half feet above the pavement surface, to an object four inches high on the
pavement. Profiles of all streets showing natural or finished grades, drawn to
an approved scale, are required.
   F.   Street Grades and Elevations. Street grades shall conform to the
following:
 
Street Type Maximum Percent Grade
Arterial    7
Collector   7
Minor       7
 
   All streets shall be designed so as to provide for the discharge of surface
water from the pavement and from the right-of-way by grading and drainage. For
adequate drainage, the minimum street grade shall be not less than one-half of
one percent. The city council shall not approve streets which will be subject
to inundation or flooding. All streets must be located at elevations which will
make them flood-free in order that portions of the subdivision will not be
isolated by floods. Where flood conditions exist, the city council shall
require profiles or elevations of streets in order to determine the
advisability of permitting the proposed subdivision activity. Fill may be used
in areas subject to flooding in order to provide flood-free streets if such
fill does not increase flood heights. Drainage openings shall be designed so as
not to restrict the flow of water and thereby increase flood heights.
   G.   Marginal Access Streets.
   1.   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial
street, the city council may require access streets, reverse frontage with
screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property
line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatment as may be
necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford
separation of through and local traffic.
   2.   Where the proposed subdivision abuts upon or contains an existing or
proposed arterial street or highway on which traffic volumes and vehicular
speeds warrant special safety considerations, the city council may require that
marginal access streets be provided in order that no lots front on such
existing or proposed arterial street or highway.
   3.   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or
limited access highway right-of-way, the city council may require a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes
in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in
appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard
for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.
   H.   Street Jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one
hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall be prohibited.
   I.   Cul-de-Sacs. Minor terminal or dead-end streets or courts which are
designed so as to have one end permanently closed shall have a turnaround
having a radius at the outside of the pavement of at least fifty (50) feet, and
a radius at the outside of the right-of-way of at least sixty (60) feet.
   J.   Street Name. Proposed streets which are in alignment with other already
existing and named streets shall bear the names of such existing streets. The
name of a proposed street which is not in alignment with an existing street
shall not duplicate the name of any existing street, irrespective of the use of
the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court, lane, road, pike,
highway, parkway or similar suffix.
   K.   Private Streets and Reserve Strips. There shall be no private streets
platted within a subdivision. There shall be no reserve strips in a subdivision
except where their control is definitely vested in the city or county under
conditions approved by the city council as authorized in these regulations.
(Ord. 433 (part), 1995)
16.20.030   Alleys.
   Alleys shall be provided to give access to the rear of all lots. The minimum
width of an alley shall be thirty (30) feet. Alley intersections and sharp
changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary, corners shall be
cut off sufficiently to permit safe vehicular movement. Dead-end alleys shall
be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, shall be provided with adequate
facilities at the dead-end as determined by the city council. Alleys shall be
provided in residential areas except in cases where the subdivider produces
evidence of no need for alleys which is satisfactory to the city council. (Ord.
433 (part), 1995)
16.20.040   Blocks.
   A.   The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due
regard to the provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special
needs of the type of use contemplated; zoning requirements as to lot sizes and
dimensions; needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of
street traffic; and limitations and opportunities of topography.
   B.   Block lengths shall not exceed one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet or
be less than three hundred (300) feet, except as the city council considers
necessary to secure efficient use of land or desired features of street layout.
   C.   Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of minimum
depth; provided, that where this would require lots to front on an arterial
street or highway or where topographical conditions or the size of the property
prevent two tiers of lots, the city council may approve a single tier of lots
of minimum depth. (Ord. 433 (part), 1995)
16.20.050   Lots.
   A.   The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation, and the minimum
building setback lines shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision
and for the type of development and use contemplated.
   B.   Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of the zoning
regulations. Residential lots shall not be less than fifty (50) feet wide nor
less than seven thousand five hundred (7,500) feet in area.
   C.   Corner lots for residential use shall have sufficient width to provide
thirty (30) feet to permit appropriate building setback from both streets.
   D.   The subdividing of the land shall be such as to provide, by means of a
public street, each lot with frontage on or satisfactory access via a new
street to an existing public street.
   E.   Double frontage, and reverse frontage lots, shall be avoided except
where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic
arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A
planting screen easement of at least ten (10) feet and across which there shall
be no right of access shall be provided along the line of lots abutting such a
traffic artery and other disadvantageous use.
   F.   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to
street lines. (Ord. 433 (part), 1995)
16.20.060   Flood hazards.
   A.   Land subject to flooding and land deemed to be topographically
unsuitable for residential development shall not be platted for residential use
or for any other use which may increase the danger to health, life or property,
or aggravate erosion or flood hazards. Such land within the subdivision shall
be set aside on the plat for such uses as will not be endangered by periodic or
occasional inundation contrary to the public welfare. To insure that lots will
be located only where they will provide flood-free house sites, the city
council may require the subdivider to provide elevation and flood profiles
sufficient to demonstrate that the house sites will be completely free from the
danger of flooding. If a stream flows through or adjacent to the proposed
subdivision, the plat plan shall provide for an easement or right-of-way along
the stream for a floodway. For the smaller streams, the plan shall also provide
for channel improvement to enable them to carry all reasonable floods within
banks.
   B.   The floor elevations of houses shall be high enough to be well above
the extraordinary flood. The floodway easement shall be wide enough to provide
for future enlargement of the stream channel as adjacent areas become more
highly developed and run-off rates are increased. (Ord. 433 (part), 1995)
16.20.070   Off-street loading and parking facilities.
   In commercial and industrial subdivisions, in the portions of residential
subdivisions reserved for commercial or industrial uses, and the lots or
parcels platted for commercial or industrial uses, lots or parcels platted for
commercial or industrial sites shall be large enough to provide for off-street
loading and unloading facilities and off- street parking facilities. (Refer to
Section 1210 of the Custer City comprehensive plan. (Ord. 433 (part), 1995)
16.20.080   Easements.
   A.   Easements across lots or on rear or side lot lines shall be provided
for utilities where necessary and shall be at least twenty (20) feet wide.
   B.   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage may,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage
right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourse, and
such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the
purpose. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith.
(Ord. 433 (part), 1995)
16.20.090   Community assets.
   In all subdivisions, due regard shall be shown for natural features such as
large trees, unusual rock formations, and watercourses; for sites which have
historical significance; and for similar assets which, if preserved, will add
attractiveness and value to the subdivision and to the area. The city council
may prepare a list of all such features within its area of planning
jurisdiction which it deems worthy of preservation. (Ord. 433 (part), 1995)
16.20.100   Conformance with other regulations.
   No final plat of land within the area of force and effect of existing zoning
regulations will be approved unless it conforms with such regulations. Whenever
there is a variance between the minimum standards set forth in these
regulations and those contained in the building code, or other official
regulations, the most stringent standard shall apply. (Ord. 433 (part), 1995)
16.20.110   Public sites and open spaces.
   A.   Where a proposed park, recreation, school or other public use shown in
a comprehensive plan is located in whole or in part in a subdivision, the city
council may require the dedication or reservation of such area within the
subdivision in those cases in which the city council deems it to be reasonable.
   B.   Where deemed essential by the city council, upon consideration of the
particular type of development proposed in the subdivision not anticipated in
the comprehensive plan, the city council may require the dedication or
reservation of such other areas or sites of a character, extent and location
suitable to the needs created by such development for parks, schools,
recreation and other public purposes. (Ord. 433 (part), 1995)
16.20.120   Large tracts or parcels.
   When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots,
such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of future streets
and logical resubdivision. (Ord. 433 (part), 1995)

16.24.030   Utility and drainage facilities.
16.24.040   Street name signs.
16.24.050   Requirements for approval of final plat.
16.24.010   Monuments.
   A.   All subdivision boundary corners and block corners (including points of
curvature) shall be marked with permanent survey monuments. A permanent survey
monument shall be a quarter-inch brass plate three inches in diameter,
permanently attached to a shaft with a minimum length of two inches and a
minimum diameter of one-half inch set flush in a concrete block twelve (12)
inches deep into the ground and twelve (12) inches in diameter. The point shall
be stamped in the plate with identifying information and the surveyor’s
registration number. Except in cases where it is deemed clearly unreasonable or
infeasible by the city council, these monuments shall be described in relation
to the located section corners of the Coordinate System of the state. All lot
corners shall be monumented with iron pins of a minimum of one-half inch in
diameter and twenty-four (24) inches in length or with iron pipe of a minimum
of three-quarters inch in diameter and twenty-four (24) inches in length.
   B.   In the event that points fall on solid bed rock, or on concrete or
stone roadways, curbs, gutters or walks, a durable metal disk or cap shall be
securely anchored in the rock or concrete and stamped with the survey point and
the registration number of the land surveyor responsible for the establishment
of the monument or marker.
   C.   In the event that the monuments or markers cannot practically be set
because of steep terrain, water, marsh or existing structures, or if they
should be lost as a result of proposed street, road or other construction, one
or more reference monuments shall be set. Affixed to the monument, in addition
to the surveyor’s registration number, shall be the letters “RM” or “WC.” Such
reference monuments shall be set as close as practical to the true corner and
shall meet the same physical standards that would be required for the true
corner were it set. If only one reference monument is used, it must be set on
the actual boundary line or a prolongation thereof. Otherwise, at least two
reference monuments shall be set.
   D.   All monuments shall be in place prior to the approval of the final
plat. However, to facilitate grading and installation of utilities, the
subdivider may, if the city council consents, file a bond with the city, to
insure placement of monuments within a period not to exceed six months after
approval of the final plat. If the subdivider elects to file a bond for the
placement of monuments, sufficient temporary staking shall be done to provide
for grading and construction. Should conditions prohibit the placing of
monuments on the line, off-set markings will be permitted; provided, however,
that exact off-set courses and distances are shown on the subdivision plat.
(Ord. 433 (part), 1995)
16.24.020   Streets.
   All plans and specifications for street grading and surfacing, including
curb and gutter and sidewalk, shall be presented to the city planning
commission for approval.
   A.   Grading Specifications. All streets, roads and alleys shall be graded
to their full widths by the subdivider so that street pavements and sidewalks
can be constructed on the same level plane. Deviation from this standard due to
special topographical conditions will be allowed only with the approval of the
city council. Before grading is started, the entire right-of-way area shall be
first cleared of all tree stumps, roots, brush and other objectionable
materials and of all trees not intended for preservation. The subgrade shall be
properly shaped, rolled and uniformly compacted to conform with the accepted
cross-section and grades. In cuts, all tree stumps, boulders, organic material,
soft clay, spongy material and other objectionable materials shall be removed
to a depth of at least two feet below the graded surface. Rock, when
encountered, shall be removed to the grade line. Junctions of cuts and fills
will be undercut to a depth of one foot. In fills, all tree stumps, boulders,
organic material, soft clay, spongy material and other objectionable material
shall be removed to a depth of at least two feet below the natural ground
surface. This objectionable matter, as well as similar matter from cuts, shall
be removed from the right-of-way area and disposed of in such a manner that it
will not become incorporated in fills or hinder proper operation of the
drainage system.
   B.   Minimum Pavement Widths. Pavement widths shall be measured back of curb
to back of curb. Minimum pavement widths to be provided are:
 
Street Type               Back of Curb to Back of Curb Widths
Parkways                  12 feet for each lane (traffic or parking)
Arterials                 38 feet back to back
Collector                 38 feet back to back
Minor                     32 feet back to back
Marginal Access           32 feet back to back
Industrial and commercial 30 feet back to back
 
   C.   Street Pavement. Street pavement shall be provided for all streets and,
according to current South Dakota State Department of Highways, standard
specifications for either portland cement concrete pavement or bituminous
concrete pavement. Such pavement shall be designed to be appropriate for the
location of the street and for the type of development and use contemplated.
The minimum requirements for surfacing of streets shall be four inches of
aggregate base and two inches of bituminous concrete pavement. If full depth
bituminous concrete paving is desired by the subdivider, each additional one
inch of bituminous concrete pavement may replace two inches of aggregate base.
   D.   Curb and Gutter. Curb and gutter shall be provided in all subdivisions.
Curbs shall not be less than six inches in height and shall be constructed of
portland cement concrete. Backfill shall be higher than the curb and shall
slope toward the curb in order to insure that surface water drains into the
storm drainage system.
   E.   Sidewalks. For the safety of pedestrians in residential and commercial
subdivisions, sidewalks constructed of portland cement concrete shall be
constructed on each lot on both sides of the street to meet the following
specifications:
   1.   Commercial developments: twelve (12) feet wide and four inches thick.
   2.   Multifamily or group housing developments: five feet wide and four
inches thick.
   3.   Single-family or duplex housing developments: four feet wide and four
inches thick. (Ord. 433 (part), 1995)
16.24.030   Utility and drainage facilities.
   A.   General. Sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water distribution, electrical,
gas, telephone and communications, cable and all other utility lines shall be
installed in rear lot easements or alleys wherever practical. Where it is
impractical to install such utility lines in rear lot easements, they shall be
installed within the unpaved portions of the street right-of-way except for
sanitary and storm sewer lines which may be installed in the paved portion of
the street right-of-way if it is impossible to install them in the unpaved
portion. All utility lines will be buried underground according to accepted
installation codes.
   2.   When it is impossible to install sanitary and storm sewer lines in the
unpaved portion of the street right-of- way, all such utility lines, including
service connections, shall be completely installed and inspected and approved
by the planning administrator, following the grading of the street and prior to
the application of any pavement base.
   3.   Where sanitary and storm sewer lines are to be installed in the unpaved
portion of the street right-of-way, the installation of service connections may
be delayed; provided, that at such time as these service connections are
installed, they may be installed without breaking or weakening the existing
pavement. Where rock is known to exist beneath the pavement area at such depth
as to interfere with the installation of service connections, the complete
installation of service connections shall be required prior to the application
of any pavement base.
   B.   Water Supply Improvements. Where the public water supply is reasonably
accessible or available to the proposed subdivision, as determined by the city
council, a complete water distribution system which shall adequately serve all
lots, which shall include appropriately spaced fire hydrants, and which shall
be properly connected with the public water supply system, shall be installed.
Where a public water supply system is not reasonably accessible to the
subdivision, alternate water supply facilities approved by the city council and
the South Dakota Board of Water and Natural Resources, SDCL 34-A-2-3 et seq.,
shall be installed.
   C.   Sanitary Sewer Improvements. Where the public sanitary sewer system is
reasonably accessible or available to the proposed subdivision, as determined
by the city council, a complete sanitary sewer system which shall adequately
serve all lots and which shall be properly connected to the public sanitary
sewer system shall be installed. Where a public sanitary sewer system is not
reasonably accessible to the subdivision, alternate community sanitary sewer
facilities, which shall be approved by the city council and the South Dakota
Board of Water and Natural Resources, SDCL 34-A-2-3 et seq., shall be
installed. In the event a community sanitary sewer is determined to be
necessary by the city council and the South Dakota Board of Water and Natural
Resources, SDCL 34-A-2-3 et seq., the same shall be installed and provision for
its continued maintenance shall be established. In any case, sanitary sewer
facilities shall be installed as required by standards and specifications as
approved by the city council and the South Dakota Board of Water and Natural
Resources, SDCL 34-A-2-3 et seq.
   D.   Storm Drainage. An adequate drainage system, including necessary open
ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets and bridges for
the proper drainage of all surface winter shall be installed. Cross drains
shall be provided to accommodate all natural winter flow and they shall be of
sufficient length to permit full width roadways and the required slopes. (Ord.
433 (part), 1995)
16.24.040   Street name signs.
   The city council shall require the installation of durable street name signs
at all intersections. (Ord. 433 (part), 1995)
16.24.050   Requirements for approval of final plat.
   No final plat of any subdivision shall be approved unless:
   A.   The improvements listed shove have been made and installed in a
satisfactory manner and approved by the city council prior to such final plat
approval;
   B.   The subdivider agrees with the city that the city may construct those
improvements listed in Sections 16.24.030 and 16.24.040 of this chapter and
assess the cost thereof against the property benefitted;
   C.   The subdivider shall enter into a contract with the city to insure
completion of the improvements listed in Sections 16.24.030 and 16.24.040 by
the subdivider within one year. The performance of said contract shall be
secured by the subdivider filing with the city a performance surety bond in an
amount equal to one and one-quarter times the cost of making such improvements
and for a period specified by the city, as estimated by the city, conditioned
upon the payment of all construction costs incurred in making such improvements
by the subdivider and all expense incurred by the city for engineering and
legal fees and other expense in connection with the making of such improvements
in order to insure the construction of the improvements in a satisfactory
manner. (Ord. 433 (part), 1995)

16.28.010   General.
   The city council may grant subdivision variances from the design and
improvement standards of this title upon receiving a recommendation from the
planning commission that strict compliance would result in undue hardship to
the subdivider/applicant, the granting of such variance will not adversely
affect the public, and shall meet the conditions as identified in Section
12.28.040. Any variance granted shall not have the effect of nullifying the
intent or purpose of the subdivision ordinance, zoning ordinance, major street
plan or other elements of the city comprehensive plan and shall be solely
granted on a case by case basis. The city council may not by variance permit
subdivision for building purposes in areas situated within the floodway of a
flood of one hundred year frequency as defined by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, without compliance with all applicable provisions of
Chapter 15.16 of this code. (Ord. 570 (part), 2002)
16.28.020   Procedure.
   A.   The applicant shall include with the submission of the preliminary plat
an application and written statement describing the requested variance and the
facts of hardship upon which the request is based. The planning commission and
city council shall consider each requested variance at a public meeting.
   B.   In granting variances, the city council may impose such conditions as
will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of this title
including the preparation and filing of a recordable document describing the
variance and conditions in full.
   C.   When any variance is granted, the approval of the proposed subdivision
shall contain a statement describing the variance and the facts and conditions
upon which the issuance of the variance is based. (Ord. 570 (part), 2002)
16.28.030   Fees.
   The fee required for filing an application for variance to the subdivision
regulations is as stated in the most recently adopted fee schedule. (Ord. 761,
2015: Ord. 570 (part), 2002)
16.28.040   Conditions.
   The city council shall not approve variances unless it first makes findings
based upon the evidence in each specific case that:
   A.   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
health, safety or general welfare, or injurious to other adjoining properties;
   B.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographic
conditions of the specific property involved, an undue hardship to the owner
would result if the strict letter of this title were enforced;
   C.   The variance will not cause a substantial increase in public costs; and
   D.   The variance will not in any manner place the subdivision in
nonconformance with any adopted zoning regulations or the comprehensive plan.

17.48.010   Purpose.
   The purpose of a variance is to allow a deviation from the strict
application of the zoning ordinances in relation to physical conditions whereby
a literal enforcement of the provisions of the zoning ordinance would result in
an unnecessary hardship for a property owner. This section shall provide a
process and procedure for review of application for a variance. The Board of
Adjustment shall approve or deny a variance to the zoning ordinance based on
consideration of the review criteria set forth in Section 
17.48.040 of this code, Planning Administrator recommendation, Planning
Commission recommendation, and all public input. (Ord. 804, 2018)
17.48.020   Variance application and fees.
   A.   Applications: any person, firm, or corporation may apply for a
variance. If such person, firm, or corporation is acting as an authorized
agent, written authorization consenting to the application shall be provided by
the property owner. An application shall be provided by the city and returned
to the Planning Administrator. The completed application along with all
supporting documentation shall be submitted to the Planning Administrator at
least twenty (20) days prior to the next regularly scheduled Planning
Commission meeting and shall illustrate:
   1.   That special conditions and circumstances exist, which are peculiar to
the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district;
   2.   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of the zoning ordinance
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same zoning district under the terms of the zoning ordinance;
   3.   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant;
   4.   That the granting of the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by the zoning ordinance to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; and
   5.   That the grounds for the application is not based on nonconforming uses
of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.

pay Custer City the appropriate fee(s) as set forth by the fee schedule adopted
annually by resolution. (Ord. 804, 2018)

   E.   The Board of Adjustment shall issue its decision after consideration of
review criteria set forth in Section
17.48.040 of this code, Planning Administrator recommendation, Planning
Commission recommendation, and all public input. A variance shall be considered
approved if the application receives an affirmative vote by two-thirds majority
of present voting members of the Board of Adjustment. As a condition of
approval, the Board of Adjustment may impose, consistent with the general
purpose of the zoning ordinance, appropriate conditions and safeguards to any
variance granted. (Ord. 843, 2020: Ord. 804, 2018)
17.48.040   Considerations for approval or denial.
   Generally, the granting of any variance shall be in harmony with the general
purposes and intent of the zoning ordinance and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood, detrimental to the public welfare, or be in conflict with the
comprehensive plan for development. The following are considered by the
Planning Commission and Board of Adjustment for the determination of the
approval or denial of a variance:
   A.   If the physical surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the
specific property involved would result in a particular hardship upon the
owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the
ordinance were to be carried out;
   B.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege that is denied by the zoning ordinance to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district;
   C.   That the conditions upon which the application for a variance is based
would not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoning
classification or other property substantially similar in use;
   D.   That variances shall not be granted to allow conditional uses, nor uses
otherwise excluded from the particular district in which requested;
   E.   That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other people or property in the area in which the
property is located, detrimental effects include but are not limited to
impairment of an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property,
negative effect to the flow of vehicle and pedestrian traffic in the public
streets, increase the danger of fire;
   F.   That because of circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility
that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of
the zoning regulations and that the authorization of a variance is therefore
necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property. (Ord. 804, 2018)
17.48.050   Variance to be considered valid.
   A variance which has been approved by the Board of Adjustment shall be
considered valid for only the property, item, subject, topic or issue in which
the variance was approved upon. (Ord. 804, 2018)
17.48.060   Appeals.
   Appeals of a decision of the Board of Adjustment may be taken to the Custer
County Circuit Court by any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved
by any decision of the Board of Adjustment, or any taxpayer, or any officer,
department, board or bureau of the city, aggrieved by any decision of the Board
of Adjustment, in the manner and form provided by the statutes of the State of
South Dakota, in such cases made and provided. (Ord. 804, 2018)
17.48.070   Invalidation of an approved variance.
   Any order of the Board of Adjustment granting a variance may be declared
invalid by the Board of Adjustment unless substantially completed within two
(2) years from the date of such order. The Planning Administrator shall notify
the property owner of record upon invalidation of a variance. (Ord. 804, 2018)
17.48.080   Reapplication after a denial.
   No applicant requesting a variance whose application includes the same or
substantially the same requirements for the same or substantially the same
property as that which has been denied by the Board of Adjustment or the
Circuit Court shall reapply again before the expiration date of one (1) year
from the date of the final action concerning the application. The reapplication
for a variance shall be processed in the same manner as a new application for a
variance. (Ord. 804, 2018)

   Within each zoning district, there are certain uses that are permitted as a
conditional use. Conditional uses provide a level of flexibility in zoning
regulations. They allow local authorities to consider and approve uses that are
not permitted "by right" in a given zoning district but can be deemed
acceptable under certain conditions. These listed conditional uses under each
district are illustrative of those which the Planning Commission may approve
permanently or approve for a specific time interval. Additionally, other
conditional uses may be allowed, which are not listed, provided they are not
contrary to the overall intent of the Chapter 17 of the Custer Municipal Code
and South Dakota Codified Law.

   The following shall be the procedures used after an application for a
conditional use and the required fees have been submitted to the city:

addressing all the information required in Section
17.52.020, shall be rejected, and returned to the applicant with the reasons

regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting that is more than twenty (20)
days from when the completed application was submitted. At the meeting, any
interested person shall be given a full, fair, and complete opportunity to be
heard.
      1.   After the application is added to the Planning Commission agenda,
notice of the application shall be given by sign, mail, and newspaper.
         a.   Sign: A sign will be furnished by the City Planner and posted by

17.52.040   Considerations for approval or denial.
   Generally, the granting of any conditional use shall be in harmony with the

(Ord. 910 (part), 2024: Ord. 805, 2018)
17.52.050   Appeals of a decision of the planning commission.
   The Planning Commission's action taken on a conditional use permit
