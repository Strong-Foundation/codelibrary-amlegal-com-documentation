GENERAL
§ 30.001 FORMS OF GOVERNMENT.
   (A)   Each first or second class municipality must be governed by a mayor
and common council, a mayor and a common council with a city manager, a board
of commissioners, or a board of commissioners with a city manager. Each third
class municipality must be governed by a board of trustees.
   (B)   The present form of government of existing municipalities must
continue until changed as provided by SDCL Title 9.
(SDCL § 9-11-11)
§ 30.002 CLASSES OF MUNICIPALITIES; CHANGE OF CLASSIFICATION.
   (A)   There are three classes of municipal corporations:
      (1)   First class, with a population of 5,000 or over;
      (2)   Second class, with a population between 500 and 4,999; and
      (3)   Third class, with a population of fewer than 500.
(SDCL § 9-2-1)
   (B)   For the purpose of classification, the population of each municipality
is determined by the last preceding federal census. Whenever the municipal
boundaries included in the last preceding census substantially differ from the
current boundaries of the municipality, the governing body by resolution may
direct the finance officer to determine the population by filing a certificate
showing the number of persons who voted at the last preceding annual municipal
election. That number multiplied by three constitutes the population for the
purpose of classification until the next federal census is completed.
(SDCL § 9-2-2)
§ 30.003 VACANCIES.
   (A)   General. If a vacancy exists on a municipal governing body, the
remaining members shall appoint a replacement to serve until the next annual
municipal election, or the vacancy may be filled by special election for the
remainder of the unexpired term as provided in division (D) of this section.
   (B)   Aldermanic form. In the aldermanic form of municipal government, the
appointment must be a person from the same ward of the first or second class
municipality.
   (C)   Election to fill remainder of term. If electing a person to fill the
remainder of the unexpired term at an annual municipal election, the vacancy
shall have occurred prior to the publication required by SDCL § 9-13-6.
(SDCL § 9-13-14.1)
   (D)   Special elections to fill vacancy on governing board, office of mayor;
procedures.
      (1)   The governing body of any municipality may, by ordinance, require
that any vacancy on the governing body or in the office of the mayor is to be
filled by a special election called for that purpose to be conducted as
provided in SDCL § 9-13-14 and this division (D).
      (2)   No special election may be held less than 90 days before the annual
municipal election. The finance officer of the municipality shall publish a
notice in the official newspaper of the municipality stating that a vacancy
exists, that the vacancy will be filled by the special election, the date of
the election, and the time and place where nominating petitions may be filed
for office.
      (3)   The notice shall be published once each week for two consecutive
weeks beginning at least 60 days before the special election. Nominating
petitions for the vacancy shall be prepared and filed as provided in SDCL § 9-
13-7, may not be circulated more than 60 days before the date of the special
election, and shall be filed at least 30 days before the date of the special
election. The number of signers required for a nominating petition shall be
calculated as provided in SDCL § 9-13-9. If a nominating petition is filed
before the second Tuesday in January, the prior year’s calculation of
registered voters shall be used. A notice of the special election shall be
published as provided in SDCL §§ 9-13-13 and 9-13-14.
(SDCL § 9-13-14.2)
   (E)   Elected official to hold office until vacancy filled. If for any
reason a municipality fails to elect any person to succeed an elected official
whose term has expired or an elected official fails to file a nominating
petition or qualify, the office is deemed vacant. The elected official whose
term has expired shall continue to act in an official capacity until the
vacancy is filled by election or appointment pursuant to divisions (C) or (D)
of this section.
(SDCL § 9-13-14.3)
Cross-reference:
   Temporary vacancy of mayor in aldermanic form, see §
30.036
§ 30.004 CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
   (A)   No municipal official may participate in discussing or vote on any
issue in which the official has a conflict of interest. Each official shall
decide if any potential conflict of interest requires such official to be
disqualified from participating in discussion or voting. However, no such
official may participate in discussing or vote on an issue if the following
circumstances apply:
      (1)   The official has a direct pecuniary interest in the matter before
the governing body; or
      (2)   At least two-thirds of the governing body votes that an official
has an identifiable conflict of interest that should prohibit such official
from voting on a specific matter.
   (B)   If an official with a direct pecuniary interest participates in
discussion or votes on a matter before the governing body, the legal sole
remedy is to invalidate that official’s vote.
(SDCL § 6-1-17)

§ 34.33 CONTRACTS, METHODS OF AWARDING.
   Unless otherwise authorized by law, each contract for supplies, services,
and construction shall be awarded by one of the following methods:
(A)   Competitive sealed bids as provided in SDCL § 5-18A-5;
   (B)   Competitive sealed proposals as provided in SDCL §§ 5-18A-6 and 5-18A-
7;
   (C)   Small purchases as provided in SDCL § 5-18A-11;
   (D)   Sole source procurement as provided in SDCL § 5-18A-8; or
   (E)   Emergency procurement as provided in SDCL § 5-18A-9.
(SDCL § 5-18A-3)
§ 34.34 SEALED BIDS.
   (A)   Required. Contracts shall be awarded by the use of competitive sealed
bids except as otherwise provided in SDCL Chapters 5-18A, 5-18B, 5-18C, and 5-
18D.
(SDCL § 5-18A-4)
   (B)   Procedures. The following procedures apply to the use of competitive
sealed bids.
      (1)   Public notice of the invitation for bids shall be given pursuant to
SDCL § 5-18A-14.
      (2)   The invitation for bids shall include a purchase description, and
all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement. The
invitation for bids for supplies shall include the length of time, not to
exceed 45 days, between the bid opening and the award of the bid.
      (3)   A bid may be submitted either manually or electronically in a
manner authorized by the purchasing agency.
      (4)   Each bid shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more
witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids. The
amount of each bid, and such other relevant information as may be specified,
together with the name of each bidder shall be recorded. Except as otherwise
provided by law, the record and each bid shall be open to public inspection.
      (5)   Each bid shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or
correction, except as authorized in this section. Each bid shall be evaluated
based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, which may
include criteria to determine acceptability such as inspection, testing,
quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose. Those
criteria that will affect the bid price and be considered in evaluation for
award shall be objectively measurable, such as discounts, transportation costs,
and total or life cycle costs. The invitation for bids shall set forth the
evaluation criteria to be used. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that
are not set forth in the invitation for bids.
      (6)   Any bid may be withdrawn by letter or by electronic communications
or in person before the time specified in the advertisement for bid. The
purchasing agency may allow modification of bids by mail, facsimile, or
electronic notice received at the place designated in the invitation to bid not
later than the time set for the opening of bids. A modification may not reveal
the bid price but shall provide the addition or subtraction or the modification
so that the final prices or terms will not be known to the purchasing agency
until the sealed bid is opened. A modification may not be withdrawn after the
time set for the opening of bids. Each modification shall be confirmed in
writing by the successful bidder before award of the contract. No bid made may
be changed or altered by telephone. After bid opening, no withdrawal of a bid
or change in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest
of the purchasing agency or fair competition is permitted. The purchasing
agency may waive technical irregularities in the bid or proposal of the low
bidder or offeror which irregularities do not alter the price, quality, or
quantity of the services, or items of tangible personal property bid or
offered. Any decision to permit the correction or withdrawal of a bid, or to
cancel an award or a contract based on a bid mistake, shall be supported by a
written determination made by the purchasing agency, and included in the bid
file.
      (7)   The contract for services or public improvement shall be awarded
within 30 days and the contract for supplies shall be awarded within 45 days of
the bid opening of the bid opening by written notice to the lowest responsible
and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth
in the invitation for bids. The purchasing agency may reject any and all bids
and readvertise for bids if none of the bids are satisfactory, or if the
purchasing agency believes an agreement has been entered into by the bidders to
prevent competition. If the low bidder is not responsible or the bid is not
made in accordance with the requirements of SDCL Chapters 5-18A, 5-18B, 5-18C,
and 5-18D or the low bid is withdrawn as authorized by this section, the bid of
the next lowest responsible and responsive bidder may be accepted.
      (8)   If it is considered impractical to initially prepare a purchase
description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be
issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an
invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been qualified
under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation.
      (9)   If, after advertising for bids, no firm bids are received, the
purchasing agency may negotiate a contract for the purchase of the supplies,
services, or public improvement projects at the most advantageous price, if the
specifications of the original bid are met.
      (10)   If two or more competitive sealed bids submitted are identical in
price and product quality, the bids are the low bid, and no resident bidder
preference is applicable, the purchasing agency may:
         (a)   Award the bid by lottery to one of the identical low bidders; or
         (b)   Reject all the bids and resolicit bids for the required
supplies, services, or public improvement.
(SDCL § 5-18A-5)
§ 34.35 SEALED PROPOSALS.
   (A)   Competitive sealed proposals; when permitted. A contract may be
entered into by competitive sealed proposals if the purchasing agency
determines in writing that the use of competitive sealed bids is either not
practicable or not advantageous.
(SDCL § 5-18A-6)
   (B)   Procedures. The procedures for issuing a contract through competitive
sealed proposals are as follows:
      (1)   The proposals shall be solicited through a request for proposals.
The request for proposals shall state the relative importance of price and
other factors, if any;
      (2)   Public notice of the request for proposals shall be given pursuant
to SDCL § 5-18A-14;
      (3)   A proposal may be submitted either manually or electronically in a
manner authorized by the purchasing agency;
      (4)   Each proposal shall be opened so as to avoid disclosure of contents
to competing offerors during the process of negotiation. A register of
proposals shall be prepared documenting the name and address of each offeror
and identifying each offeror awarded a contract. The register shall be open for
public inspection after contract award;
      (5)   As provided in the request for proposals, a discussion may be
conducted with any responsible offeror who submitted a proposal determined to
be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of
clarification to assure full understanding of, and responsiveness to, the
solicitation requirements. Each offeror shall be accorded fair and equal
treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of a
proposal. A revision may be permitted after a submission and prior to an award
for the purpose of obtaining the best and final offer. In conducting any
discussion, there may be no disclosure of any information derived from any
proposal submitted by a competing offeror;
      (6)   An award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal
conforms to the solicitation and is determined in writing to be the most
advantageous to the purchasing agency taking into consideration price and the
evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No other factors or
criteria may be used in the evaluation. The contract file shall contain the
basis on which the award is made. Written notice of the award of a contract to
the successful offeror shall be promptly given to each offeror. The purchasing
agency may reject any and all proposals and readvertise for proposals if none
of the proposals are satisfactory, or if the purchasing agency believes any
agreement has been entered into by the offerors to prevent competition; and
      (7)   This section does not apply to state professional service contracts
issued pursuant to SDCL §§ 5-18A-37 and 5-18D-17 to 5-18D-24, inclusive.
(SDCL § 5-18A-7)
§ 34.36 UNIQUE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES; SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT; NEGOTIATIONS.
   (A)   Unique supplies and services. A contract may be awarded for supplies
or services without competition if the purchasing agency determines in writing
that the supplies or services are of such a unique nature that the contractor
selected is clearly and justifiably the only practicable source to provide the
supplies or services.
   (B)   Sole source. The determination that the contractor selected is
justifiably the sole source shall be based on either the uniqueness of the
supplies or services or the sole availability at the location required.
   (C)   Negotiations. In such cases, the purchasing agency shall conduct
negotiations, including price, delivery, and quantity to obtain the most
advantageous price and shall include the written verification of the sole
source in the contract file. This section does not apply to construction
services or construction equipment.
(SDCL § 5-18A-8)
   (D)   Records of sole source procurement contracts. The purchasing agency
shall maintain a record listing each contract made under sole source
procurement and emergency procurement for a minimum of five years. The record
shall contain:
      (1)   Each contractor’s name;
      (2)   The amount and type of each contract; and
      (3)   A listing of the supplies, services, and public improvements
procured under each contract.
(SDCL § 5-18A-10)
§ 34.37 EMERGENCY PROCUREMENT.
   (A)   Allowed. A purchasing agency may make or authorize others to make an
emergency procurement without advertising the procurement if rentals are not
practicable and there exists a threat to public health, welfare, or safety or
for other urgent and compelling reasons. Failure to abide by the bid provisions
of SDCL Chapters 5-18A, 5-18B, 5-18C, and 5-18D in a timely manner is not an
emergency. An emergency procurement shall be made with such competition as is
practicable under the circumstances. A written determination of the basis for
the emergency and for the selection of the particular contractor shall be
included in the contract file.
(SDCL § 5-18A-9)
   (B)   Records of sole emergency procurement contracts. The purchasing agency
shall maintain a record listing each contract made under sole source
procurement and emergency procurement for a minimum of five years. The record
shall contain:
      (1)   Each contractor’s name;
      (2)   The amount and type of each contract; and
      (3)   A listing of the supplies, services, and public improvements
procured under each contract.

§ 34.38 PURCHASES OF SUPPLIES AND SERVICES UNDER $50,000.
   Unless otherwise specified by statute, purchases of supplies and services
under $50,000 shall be made as follows.
   (A)   Purchases under $50,000 may be made in accordance with procedures
established by the purchasing agency.
   (B)   No purchases may be artificially divided to constitute a small
purchase under this section.
(SDCL § 5-18A-11)
§ 34.39 CANCELLATION OF INVITATION FOR BIDS OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND
REJECTION OF BIDS OR PROPOSALS.
   An invitation for bids, a request for proposals, or other solicitation may
be canceled, or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected in whole or in
part as may be specified in the solicitation, if the purchasing agency
determines it is in the best interests of the agency. The reasons for the
cancellation or rejection shall be made part of the contract file.
(SDCL § 5-18A-12)
§ 34.40 PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTS INVOLVING $100,000; SUPPLIES AND SERVICES
CONTRACTS INVOLVING $50,000 OR MORE; ADVERTISEMENT FOR BIDS OR PROPOSALS.
   If the purchasing agency intends to enter into a contract for any public
improvement that involves the expenditure of $100,000 or more, or a contract
for the purchase of supplies or services, other than professional services,
that involves the expenditure of $50,000 or more, the purchasing agency shall
advertise for bids or proposals. The advertisement shall appear as a legal
notice in the appointed legal newspaper. The advertisement shall be printed at
least twice, with the first publication at least ten days before opening of
bids or the deadline for the submission of proposals. The first publication
shall be in each official newspaper of the purchasing agency, and the second
publication may be in any legal newspaper of the state chosen by the purchasing
agency. If the purchasing agency has no official newspaper, the first
publication shall be made in a legal newspaper with general circulation in the
jurisdiction of the purchasing agency to be selected by the purchasing agency.
The advertisement shall state the time and place where the bids will be opened
or the deadline for the submission of proposals. In each notice, the purchasing
agency shall reserve the right to reject any or all bids or proposals.

§ 34.41 TIME FOR ENTERING INTO CONTRACT.
   After receiving notice of a contract award, the successful bidder or offeror
shall enter into a contract with the purchasing agency within the time
specified in the invitation for bids or request for proposals. If any bidder or
offeror fails to enter into a contract within the time specified, the contract
may be awarded to the next lowest responsive and responsible bidder or offeror
for the same kind of work and material, unless all bids or proposals are
rejected. The defaulting bidder or offeror shall be responsible for the
difference in price.
(SDCL § 5-18A-15)
§ 34.42 RECOVERY FROM DEFAULTING BIDDER OR OFFEROR.
   If any successful bidder or offeror fails to fulfill the conditions of an
