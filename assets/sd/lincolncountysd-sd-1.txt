§ 152.023 SUBDIVISION PLAN EXEMPTIONS; MINOR PLAT.
   (A)   (1)   The purpose of this section is to provide for the timely review
of minor plats and replats (including plats for transfer of ownership) that do
not discernibly impact surrounding properties, environmental resources, or
public facilities.
      (2)   No concept plan, preliminary plan, or final plans are required.
Minor plats and replats are administratively approved by the Planning Director
and must comply with all requirements of a plat in §
152.051.
   (B)   Minor plats requirements:
      (1)   A minor plat is a plat containing not more than three lots fronting
on an existing road and meets all of the following requirements:
         (a)   Does not require the dedication of a right-of-way or
construction of new roads;
         (b)   Does not require the creation of easements;
         (c)   Does not create a lot or tract eligible for any public or
private improvements other than sidewalks;
         (d)   Does not landlock or otherwise impair convenient ingress or
egress to or from the rear side of the subject tract or any adjacent property;
         (e)   Does not change the grades from the grading plan which was
submitted and approved with the original plat or, if the grades are going to be
changed, then a grading plan shall be submitted and approved for the minor plat
or replat;
         (f)   Does not significantly change any plans that have been prepared
for the placement of any other utilities in the subdivision;
         (g)   Does not adversely affect the remainder of the parcel or
adjoining property; and
         (h)   Does not conflict with any provision or portion of the
comprehensive plan, official map, zoning ordinance, or these regulations.
      (2)   A replat includes all the requirements of a minor plat and shall
also include the minor vacation of existing platted lines to achieve either a
reconfiguration of the existing recorded plat or change the number of recorded
lots in the subdivision only where the perimeter of the tract being replatted
is not altered by the replat. Also, a replat shall certify that the platting
vacates the existing plat.

PLANS
§ 152.035 CONCEPT PLAN SUBMISSION.
   (A)   A concept plan is a process designed to help a developer save time and
expense in preparing a preliminary plan and a plat. The advantage of a concept
plan is that county staff will provide important information upfront that may
significantly affect the development. It is recommended that at least some
preliminary drainage engineering be completed during the concept plan stage.
All concept plans for review shall be submitted to the Planning Director.
   (B)   Prior to the submission of the preliminary subdivision plan and, if
needed, rezoning to the Planning Commission, the developer shall submit a
concept plan to the Planning Director. County staff comments on the concept
plan shall be sent to the developer within 15 working days. The requirement for
a concept plan may be waived by the Planning Director. A developer may choose
to submit a concept plan for comments that has all elements of a preliminary
subdivision plan.

deficiencies, the Planning Director may list conditions to the approval of the
subdivision application to the Planning Commission.
   (B)   The Board of County Commissioners, in taking action on a preliminary
plan, shall consider the recommendations of the Planning Commission and shall
hold a public hearing at a regularly scheduled meeting. It shall then approve,
disapprove, or approve with conditions based upon the criteria within §
152.036(B). Approval of the preliminary plan shall indicate the Board of County
Commissioners’ approval of the general location of the lots, blocks, and
streets including the interrelationship to proposed zoning districts or land
uses; all of which shall be so noted on the preliminary subdivision plan’s
certificate of approval. The approved plan shall be kept on file in the office
of the Planning Director. Any conditions included by the Board of County
Commissioners shall be resolved on a revised preliminary plan which would be
submitted to the Planning Director for administrative approval before any
development engineering plans and plats are submitted.

            5.   Other elevation as determined by the county.
         (c)   Driveway culverts shall be designed for the five-year storm
occurrence. Any driveway culverts that exceed the minimum size of 18 inches
shall be constructed by the developer along with the road improvements. Roadway
culverts, drainageways, and road ditches should generally be designed for the
25-year storm occurrence;
      (5)   The boundaries of all drainage easements and detention ponds. A
maintenance agreement for the upkeep of all drainage facilities, including on-
site detention, drainageways, detention ponds, and drainage channels, and
natural or established watercourses shall be filed with the plat;
      (6)   Individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general
surface drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as to
avoid a concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent lots.
Concentrated flows from the subdivision shall only occur at locations where
concentrated flows previously existed;
      (7)   It shall be the responsibility of each lot owner to install and
maintain a culvert under the driveway, unless installed by the developer, when
lot development commences; and
      (8)   (a)   Discharge or concentrated flows onto adjacent properties
shall be located generally at existing drainage conveyance locations and will
be reviewed and approved with final development plans.
         (b)   The applicant shall provide written permission from adjacent
landowner, drainage easement, or energy dissipation methods as reviewed and
approved by the county.

EROSION CONTROL PLAN
§ 152.110 SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Measures used to control erosion on a development site shall, at a
minimum, meet the standards and specifications of the county’s Conservation
District. Stripping of vegetation, regrading, and cut and fill operations
should be kept to a minimum, as should the amount of land and the duration of
exposure. Whenever feasible, development plans should be made in conformance
with topography in order to create the least erosion potential. Similarly, as
much as possible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected, and
supplemented. The Planning Director, with assistance of the Conservation
District, shall require any further measures as necessary to prevent erosion on
building sites and developments from depositing wastes or sediments on roads or
other property. Every effort shall be made to retain the natural vegetation on
all ditches and drainageways. Ditches and drainageways will not be disturbed
without the approval of the Planning Director and County Floodplain
Administrator.
   (B)   Erosion control plans shall show:
      (1)   All proposed land disturbance including areas of excavation,
grading, filling, removal, or destruction of topsoil and spreading of earth
material; and
      (2)   Provisions for erosion control during construction. Such provisions
shall include the sequence of the operations listed above with an estimated
time of exposure. The proposed temporary measures to control erosion will be
designed to withstand the two-year rain and be shown on the plan.
(Ord. 1104-63, passed 4-26-2011)
§ 152.111 EXISTING FEATURES.
   Existing natural features which would add value to the development or to the
county as a whole, such as trees, water courses, historical, and/or scenic
sites, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the design of
the subdivision.
(Ord. 1104-63, passed 4-26-2011)
ASSURANCES FOR COMPLETION OF MINIMUM IMPROVEMENTS
§ 152.125 ASSURANCES FOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   No plat of any subdivision shall be approved, unless the improvement
(s) required by this subchapter have been installed prior to such approval, or
unless the developer shall have posted a surety bond or irrevocable letter of
credit or acceptable cash deposit assuring completion of all required
improvements.
   (B)   No building permits shall be issued until assurances have been filed
or all required road improvements have been completed.
(Ord. 1104-63, passed 4-26-2011)
§ 152.126 MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS.
   (A)   Where the subdivision contains sewers, sewage treatment plants, water
supply systems, park areas, storm drainage systems, road systems, or other
facilities or services which are necessary to or desirable for the area, and
which are of common use or benefit and which are not accepted for maintenance
by an existing public agency, provisions shall be made by trust agreement for
the proper and continuous maintenance and supervision of such facilities.
   (B)   A final and signed copy of the agreement shall be attached to each and
every plat having a facility or service covered by such an agreement.
(Ord. 1104-63, passed 4-26-2011)
§ 152.127 EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Easements shall be provided and dedicated where necessary for wires,
cables, conduits, fixtures, and equipment for distribution of electric power,
wastewater collectors, storm drains, overland storm water flow routes,
sidewalks, pedestrian ways, bikeways, private roadways, and water mains at such
locations and widths as determined by the county.
   (B)   In any dedication of an easement, the county may prohibit or restrict
building, fences, driveways, and other improvements; may enter for
construction, reconstruction, replacement, repair, operation, and maintenance
purposes; and will be held harmless for the cost of replacement or damage to
any improvement or vegetation within the easement and may make any other
appropriate or necessary requirements.
      (1)   All easements for utilities shall be shown on the plat.
      (2)   Lots and easements shall be arranged in such a manner as to
eliminate unnecessary jogs or offsets and to facilitate the use of easements
for power distribution, telephone service, drainage, water, and sewer services.
      (3)   (a)   The property owner whose property is subject to such
easements shall be responsible for its maintenance.
         (b)   The property owners shall keep the easement clear of any
structure, debris, trees, shrubs, or landscaping whatsoever except that lawn
grass, which shall be regularly mowed, and annual vegetation may be grown
thereon.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.001 TITLE.
   These regulations shall be known as the “2021 Floodplain Management
Ordinance for Lincoln County.”
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.002 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   (A)   The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is a voluntary program
administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a component of
the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and county’s officials have elected
to join the program, participate, and enforce the Flood Damage Prevention
Ordinance and the requirements and regulations of the NFIP. The National Flood
Insurance Program, established in this chapter, provides that areas of the
county having a special flood hazard be identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and that floodplain management measures be applied in such
flood hazard areas. Furthermore, the county may elect to administer this
chapter to areas not identified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) by FEMA
on the community’s effective flood insurance rate map (FIRM), if the community
has documentation to support that there is an inherent risk of flooding in such
areas.
   (B)   The legislature of the state has, in SDCL § 11-2-13, delegated the
authority to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses to local
governmental units. Therefore, as a basis for adopting such regulations, the
Board of County Commissioners does hereby make the following legislative
findings of fact:
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic
inundation which results in the loss of life and property, the creation of
health and safety hazards, the disruption of commerce and governmental
services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and
relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains, which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
flood proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage, and by uses deemed
unsuitable for floodplain areas or that do not account for the increased flood
risk.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.003 OBJECTIVES AND METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   (A)   Objectives. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the community and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed
to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize damage to public infrastructure, including, but not
limited to, utilities, streets, and bridges that are susceptible to flooding;
      (3)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions caused by flooding;
      (4)   Minimize public expenditures on flood control projects;
      (5)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and are generally undertaken at the expense of the public;
       (6)   Protect and safeguard the welfare and safety of first responders
should an emergency response be needed;
      (7)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
      (8)   Promote that potential buyers are notified if properties are in a
flood area.
   (B)   Methods of reducing flood losses. To accomplish the purposes outlined
in division (A) above, this chapter applies the following methods:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit land uses that are dangerous to health,
safety, or property in times of flooding, or cause excessive increases in flood
heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that land uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Regulate the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
      (4)   Regulate filling, grading, dredging, and other developments that
may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.004 SCOPE.
   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all proposed development in a
flood hazard area identified by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or
areas of identified and documented flood risk supported using best available
data within the unincorporated area of the county.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.005 APPLICABILITY.
   This chapter provides minimum requirements for development located in flood
hazard areas, including, but not limited to, the subdivision of land,
installation, and repair of utilities, placement and replacement of
manufactured homes, new construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
or additions to new construction, and substantial improvements of existing
buildings and structures, including restoration after damage and the placement
of fill, debris, equipment, or materials.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.006 ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOOD HAZARD AREAS.
   (A)   Areas of special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in a scientific and engineering report
entitled “Flood Insurance Study for Lincoln County, South Dakota,” (FIS)
together with the accompanying flood insurance rate map (FIRM), dated October
5, 2017, and any revision thereto are hereby automatically adopted by reference
and delared to be a part of this chapter. The community has elected to adopt
best available data to regulate floodplain development in addition to utilizing
the effective FIS and FIRM. Where the best available data contradicts the FIS
or FIRM, the more restrictive data shall be utilized.
   (B)   A floodplain development permit shall be required to ensure
conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.007 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and another
ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.008 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall
be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.009 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (A)   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and may occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and
bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that land
outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas
will be free from flooding or flood damage.
   (B)   This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the county, any
officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency for any
flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made hereunder.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.010 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, provision, or portion of this chapter is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court, the remainder of the chapter shall not
be affected.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.011 COMPLIANCE.
   No structures or developments, including buildings, recreation vehicles,
manufactured homes, or land, shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its
use changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other
applicable regulations. Nothing herein shall prevent the county from taking
such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violations.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 153.012 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of these regulations certain terms are hereby defined as
follows. Any word that is not defined herein shall be defined as in any
recognized standard English dictionary. Additional definitions are also found
in the Code of Federal Regulations for the National Flood Insurance Program in
Title 44, § 59.1.
   100-YEAR FLOOD. A flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
during any given year (1% annual chance flood). 100-YEAR FLOOD, 1% ANNUAL
CHANCE FLOOD, and BASE FLOOD are synonymous. The term does not imply that the
flood will happen once every 100 years. Mandatory flood insurance requirements
may apply.
   100-YEAR FLOODPLAIN. The area susceptible to being inundated by the base
flood (1% annual chance flood).
   500-YEAR FLOOD. A flood having a 0.2% chance of being equaled or exceeded
during any given year (0.2% annual chance flood). The term does not imply that
the flood will happen once every 500 years. Mandatory flood insurance
requirements generally do not apply.
   500-YEAR FLOODPLAIN. The area susceptible to being inundated by a 0.2%
annual chance flood.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure on the same parcel of property as the
principal structure and with the same ownership. It is a structure of low value
used solely for the parking of vehicles and storage of tools, materials, or
equipment incidental to the use of the principal structure. No human habitation
is allowed within an accessory structure.
   ADDITION. Any improvement that expands the enclosed footprint or increases
the square footage of an existing structure including lateral additions to the
sides, front, or rear of a structure, vertical additions on top of a structure,
and enclosures or crawlspaces made underneath a structure.
   APPROXIMATE STUDIES. Flood hazard mapping using approximate study methods
that show the approximate outline of the base floodplain. An APPROXIMATE STUDY
does not produce a base flood elevation.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO, AH, or VO zone on the flood
insurance rate map (FIRM) characterized by ponding (AH zone) or sheet flow (AO
zone) and having an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined
channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where
velocity flow may be evident.
   AUTHORIZED AGENT. A person who has been legally empowered to act on behalf
of another person or an entity. Only a licensed attorney may act as agent for
an incorporated municipality.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year (1% annual chance flood). BASE FLOOD is also referred to as the 100-
YEAR FLOOD.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The surface elevation of the 1% annual chance
flood event, relative to a standard datum. The county’s flood insurance rate
map (FIRM) uses the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD 88).
   BASEMENT. Any area of a building having its floor sub-grade (below ground
level) on all sides. A walkout basement that does not require a step up to the
grade is not considered a BASEMENT.
   BENCHMARK. A monument on the ground which shows the elevation of that
monument above sea level within a standard datum or design plan.
   BEST AVAILABLE DATA. Existing flood hazard information adopted by a
community and reflected on the effective FIRM and FIS report; or draft of
preliminary flood hazard information supplied by FEMA or from another source.
Other sources may include, but are not limited to, state, other federal
agencies, or local studies, the more restrictive of which would be reasonably
used by the community.
   BUFFER ZONE. See FLOOD HAZARD AREA BUFFER ZONE.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   CHANNELIZATION. The artificial creation, enlargement, realignment, or
alteration of a stream channel’s slope, shape, or alignment. Streambank
restoration may be deemed as CHANNELIZATION.
   CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS (CFR). The codification of the general and
permanent rules published in the federal register by the executive departments
and agencies of the federal government.
   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). FEMA’s comment on a proposed
project that would, upon construction, affect the hydrologic and/or hydraulic
characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the
existing regulatory floodway, the effective BFEs, and/or the SFHA. The letter
does not revise an effective map; it indicates whether the project, if built as
proposed, would be recognized by FEMA. A CLOMR is followed by a LOMR upon
completion of the project.
   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION BASED ON FILL (CLOMR-F). FEMA’s comment
on a proposed structure or property. The letter from FEMA does not revise an
effective map; it indicates whether the project, if built as proposed, would be
removed from the floodplain.
   CRAWLSPACE. An under-floor space that has its interior floor area (finished
or not) no more than four feet from the bottom floor joist of the next higher
floor elevation, designed with proper flood openings to equalize hydrostatic
pressures of floodwater, and is not used for habitation. (Refer to FEMA
Technical Bulletin No. 1: Crawlspaces.)
   DATUM. A common vertical elevation reference usually in relation to sea
level such as the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD 29), North American
Vertical Datum (NAVD 88), or other datum.
   DEED RESTRICTION. A clause in a deed that limits the future use of the
property in some respect. DEED RESTRICTIONS may impose a variety of limitations
and conditions. For example, they may limit the density of buildings, dictate
the types of structures that can be erected, or prevent buildings or parts of
buildings from being used for specific purposes, or from being used at all.
   DETACHED GARAGE. A building that is used solely for storage of materials or
vehicle parking for up to four housing occupants. If a DETACHED GARAGE is

cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on average, equals or
exceeds 25% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before “start of
construction” of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred
“substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code violations identified by the
building official and that are the minimum necessary conditions to assure safe
living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
strict enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance of 44 C.F.R. 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)

as that documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the North American
Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, (or other datum, when specified) of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies, such as the 1% annual chance flood event,
in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
   WATERCOURSE. The channel and banks of identifiable water in a creek, brook,
stream, river, ditch, or other similar feature.
   ZONE A. A high risk special flood hazard area shown on the county’s flood
insurance rate map developed using approximate study methods and therefore no
base flood elevations are provided.
   ZONE AE. A high-risk special flood hazard area shown on the county’s flood
insurance rate map developed using detailed study methods and includes base
flood elevations.
   ZONE X. An area of minimal flood hazard depicted on the county’s flood
insurance rate map as all areas outside of the A Zones. ZONE X may still have
flooding that does not meet the criteria to be mapped as a special flood hazard
area, especially ponding and local drainage problems. ZONE X replaces Zone C of
the previous FIRM.

(Ord. 2016-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.066 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all areas of flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been
provided as set forth in this chapter, the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement),
elevated to at least two feet above the base flood elevation. A registered
professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall certify to the
Floodplain Administrator that the elevation standard has been satisfied.
Properties that have received a letter of map amendment or letter of map
revision based upon fill must have the lowest structure opening elevated to two
feet above the base flood elevation and conform to the provisions of this
section and FEMA/FIA-TB-10.01.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure
shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to at least

level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial,
industrial, or other non-residential structure, including, but not limited to,
detached garages, agricultural buildings, and storage buildings, may be allowed
to be wet floodproofed, provided that:
         (a)   The structure is strictly a non-residential structure used only
for building access, parking, or storage;
         (b)   The structure is an accessory structure of low value;
         (c)   The structure is designed to allow for the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters through the use of flood openings;
         (d)   The structure is constructed of flood resistant materials;
         (f)   The structure is properly anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement;

floodproofed to at least two feet or more above the BFE;
         (g)   The structure is compliant with the floodway encroachment
provisions of the NFIP and this chapter; and
         (h)   The structure is designed and built to adhere to FEMA Technical
Bulletins No. 1, 2, and 7.
      (2)   (a)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop
and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the
construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are
in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this division
(B).
         (b)   A record of such certification which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are flood
proofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   (a)   If the use or occupancy of the building changes in the future
to be considered residential, then the floodproofing of the structure cannot be
used when determining compliance of the structure to the residential
construction requirements of this chapter.
         (b)   As such, the building will not be grandfathered into compliance
and will be required to be brought into compliance with the residential
construction requirements of this chapter.
      (4)   Properties that have received a letter of map amendment or letter
of map revision based upon fill must have the lowest structure opening elevated
to two feet above the base flood elevation and conform to the provisions of
this section and FEMA/FIA-TB-10.
   (C)   Enclosures.
      (1)   New construction or substantial improvements, excluding crawl
spaces, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a
basement, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters.
      (2)   Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect, or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided, or be designed by a professional engineer to be of equal
capacity;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade;
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters; and
         (d)   The bottom of the floor joists of the structure’s lowest floor
shall be at least two feet above the BFE.
      (3)   The development and construction of the structure must conform with
the provisions in FEMA/Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) Technical
Bulletins No. 1 and 2.
      (4)   For any non-residential construction that has an enclosure, a non-
conversion agreement must be completed as part of the permitting process. The
non-conversion agreement:
         (a)   Acknowledges the risk associated with this building practice;
         (b)   Acknowledges that the area was permitted as an enclosure and
shall only be used as a non-residential accessory of low value for the purpose
of building access, parking, or storage; and
         (c)   Allows for community, state, and/or federal officials to conduct
periodic inspections to ensure compliance.
   (D)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   All new and replacement manufactured homes to be placed or
substantially improved in a flood hazard area shall be elevated such that the
lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to at least two feet above
the base flood elevation.
      (2)   All new and replacement manufactured homes, including substantial
improvement of existing manufactured homes, shall be placed on a permanent,
reinforced foundation (including pile or column foundations) that is adequately
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects
of wind and flood loads acting simultaneously on all building components.
   (E)   Recreational vehicles.
      (1)   For temporary placement, recreational vehicles in flood hazard
areas shall be fully licensed and ready for highway use, and shall be placed on
a site for less than 180 consecutive days. A recreational vehicle is ready for
highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site
only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions.
      (2)   For permanent placement, recreational vehicles that are not ready
for highway use or that are to be placed on a site for more than 180
consecutive days shall meet the requirements of §
153.067 for manufactured homes.
   (F)   Crawlspace. New construction and substantial improvements built on a
crawlspace or sub-grade (below grade) crawlspace may be permitted if the
development is designed and meets or exceeds the standards found in FEMA’s
Technical Bulletins No. 1, 2, and 11, which include, but are not limited to,
the following provisions.
      (1)   The structure must be affixed to a permanent foundation, designed
and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of
the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the
effects of buoyancy. Because of hydrodynamic loads, crawlspace construction is
not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than five feet per second,
unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional, such as a
registered architect or professional engineer.
       (2)   The crawlspace is an enclosed area below the BFE and, as such,
must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. The bottom of each flood opening can
be no more than one foot above the LAG.
      (3)   The crawlspace enclosure must have proper openings that allow
equalization of hydrostatic pressure by allowing automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters. To achieve this, a minimum of one square inch of flood opening is
required per one square foot of the enclosed area subject to flooding. A
registered professional engineer must certify the elevation, design, and
location of flood openings.
      (4)   Portions of the building below the BFE must be constructed with
materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation
walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building, but also insulation,
piers, or other materials that extend below two foot above the BFE. Floor
joists and ductwork must be placed two feet above the BFE.
      (5)   Any building utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated
two feet above the BFE, or be designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or
accumulate within the system components during flood conditions.
      (6)   The interior grade of a crawlspace below the BFE must not be more
than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade.
      (7)   The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the lowest
interior grade of the crawlspace floor to the bottom of the floor joist of the
next higher floor cannot exceed four feet at any point.
      (8)   There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters
from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should be drained
within a reasonable time after a base flood event.
      (9)   Buildings with below-grade crawlspaces will have higher flood
insurance premiums than buildings that have the preferred crawlspace
construction, with the interior elevation at or above the LAG.

be provided prior to construction activity;
   (J)   Utilities and facilities shall comply with design criteria set forth
in this chapter and other appropriate codes, ordinances, and laws and shall be
located and constructed to minimize flood damage; and
   (K)   Buildings sites, walkways, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, and
roadways of subdivision development proposals shall be designed and
constructed, to the maximum extent practicable, so they are located on land
with a natural grade with elevations not less than one foot above the base
flood elevation and with dry land access.
(Ord. 2016-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.068 BUFFER ZONE STANDARDS.
   For areas located within 100 feet (or five feet of increase in elevation,
whichever occurs first) of a flood hazard area, the following minimum
requirements shall apply to construction of residential and commercial
structures:
   (A)   The minimum setback distance from the edge of a flood hazard area to
the nearest wall of a basement shall be 50 feet;
   (B)   The lowest floor level elevation (including basement) shall be no more
than two feet below the closest adjacent base flood elevation;
   (C)   The lowest opening shall be no less than two feet above the base flood
elevation; and
   (D)   Additional requirements in conformance with the provisions of FEMA/FIA
Technical Bulletin No. l0-01 may be required to ensure that a structure is
reasonably safe from flooding.
(Ord. 2016-34, passed 6-22-2021)
FLOODWAY DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
§ 153.080 DEVELOPMENT IN FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard are extremely
hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and erosion potential. Therefore, the following
provisions shall apply:
   (A)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway, unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase greater than 0.00 feet;
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with
all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
153.065 through
153.068;
   (C)   Buildings shall not be used for human habitation;
   (D)   Pipeline crossings through a river or stream shall be buried in the
river or stream bed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent
rupture due to channel degradation, meandering, or the action of flood flows;
   (E)   Storage of material, equipment, or debris is prohibited; and
   (F)   A floodway encroachment that increases the level of the base flood may
be authorized under the provisions of 44 C.F.R. Chapter 1, § 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Regulations, if the applicant has received a
conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.081 SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS AND DAMAGES.
   For applications located in a flood hazard area involving building permits
to improve buildings and structures, including alterations, movement,
enlargement, replacement, repair, change of occupancy, additions,
rehabilitations, renovations, and any other improvement of, or work on, such
buildings and structures, the Floodplain Administrator, in coordination with
applicable community officials and staff, shall:
   (A)   Estimate the market value by using the county-appraised value, or the
applicant may obtain an appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified
independent appraiser. The value shall be of the building or structure only,
not of the building and land, as it exists before the start of construction of
the proposed work. In the case of repair, the market value of the building or
structure shall be the market value before the damage occurred and before any
repairs are made;
   (B)   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a
damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of
improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building or
structure;
   (C)   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage. The determination may
require evaluation of previous permits issued for improvements and repairs;
   (D)   Utilize FEMA’s substantial improvement/substantial desk reference when
making any determination on an substantial improvement and/or substantial
damage;
   (E)   The substantial improvement regulations apply to all work that is
proposed as the improvement, even if multiple permits are issued. Therefore,
the determination of the cost of the improvement should consider all costs of
all phases of the work before issuance of the first permit; and
   (F)   Notify the applicant that, if it is determined that the work
constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage, that
compliance with this chapter is required.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
VARIANCE PROVISIONS
§ 153.095 VARIANCE PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The Board of County Commissioners shall hear and render judgment on
requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter only after a
floodplain development permit has been denied.
   (B)   The Board of County Commissioners shall hear and render judgement on
an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement,
decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   (C)   The Floodplain Administrator shall request an opinion letter from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency and the State Office of Emergency
Management prior to hearing any variance or appeal.
   (D)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and the State Office of Emergency Management upon issuing a
variance.
   (E)   Upon consideration of the factors noted and the intent of this
chapter, the Board of County Commissioners may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and
objectives of this chapter.
   (F)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice of the variance and the conditions thereof, that the structure will be
permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood
elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.096 OPERATIONAL PREREQUISITES FOR GRANTING VARIANCES.
   The following shall be considered prerequisites for the granting of
variances:
   (A)   A technical justification showing good and sufficient cause that the
unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site
renders the elevation standards inappropriate;
   (B)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on, or victimization of, the
public, conflict with existing local laws or ordinances, consider the need of
ingress and egress during times of floods, and does not jeopardize first
responders’ health and welfare;
   (C)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
   (D)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.097 APPEALS.
   Appeals may be taken to circuit court by any person or persons, jointly or
severally, aggrieved by any decision of the Board in the manner and form
provided by state statutes, in such cases made and provided.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.098 VARIANCE FOR HISTORIC STRUCTURES.
   A variance is authorized to be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of a
historic structure upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure, and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure. The term SUBSTANTIAL
IMPROVEMENT does not include any alteration of a structure or facility listed
on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic
Places.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.099 INSURANCE IMPLICATION.
   It must be emphasized that variances are granted with respect to floodplain
management requirements and do not affect flood insurance rates. The Federal
Insurance Administration, by statute, must charge insurance rates commensurate
with the risk to which a building is exposed. Insurance rates for buildings
constructed under variances are generally higher than rates for a comparable
structure that is fully compliant. In some instances, the additional costs of
insuring these buildings, if they are not elevated or floodproofed in
accordance with the NFIP requirements, would approach or even exceed the costs
of meeting NFIP elevation or dry floodproofing requirements, and the structure
would still be exposed to flood damages.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.100 RESTRICTIONS.
   The Board of Adjustment shall not issue a variance for any proposed
development in a floodway that would have the effect of waiving requirements
set forth in §§
153.080 and
153.081.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.101 CONSIDERATIONS.
   In reviewing applications for variances, the Board of Adjustment shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all other portions of
this chapter, and the following:
   (A)   The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands
resulting in further injury or damage;
   (B)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
   (C)   The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents, to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future owners;
   (D)   The importance of the services to the community which will be provided
by the proposed development;
   (E)   The availability of alternate locations for the proposed development
that are not subject to flooding or erosion;
   (F)   The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and
anticipated development;
   (G)   The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
   (H)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
   (I)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rise, and debris and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
   (J)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets, and bridges.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.102 NOTIFICATION.
   (A)   In accordance with the NFIP regulations, communities must notify the
applicant, in writing, that the issuance of a variance will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance.
   (B)   In accordance with the NFIP regulations, communities must notify the
applicant, in writing, that such construction below the BFE increases risks to
life and property.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021)
§ 153.103 FEES.

ENFORCEMENT
§ 153.115 STOP WORK ORDER.
   (A)   Authority. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator finds any work or
activity regulated by this chapter being performed in a manner contrary to the
provisions of this chapter, the Floodplain Administrator is authorized to issue
a stop work order.
   (B)   Unlawful acts. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or
corporation to erect, construct, alter, extend, repair, move, remove, demolish,
or occupy any building, structure, facility, or equipment regulated by this
chapter, or cause same to be done in conflict with or in violation of any of
the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Issuance. The stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given
to the owner of the property involved, or to the owner’s agent, or to the
person doing the work. Upon receipt of a stop work order, the cited work shall
immediately cease. The stop work order shall state the reason for the order and
the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume.
   (D)   Unlawful continuance. Any person who shall continue any work after
having been served with a stop work order, except such work as that person is
directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition, shall be subject
to penalties as prescribed by law.
   (E)   Prosecution of violation. If the notice of violation is not complied
with promptly, the appropriate authorities of the county, in addition to other
remedies, may institute injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action or
proceeding to restrain, correct, or abate such violation, or to require the
removal or termination of the unlawful occupancy of the real estate, structure,
or facility in violation of the provisions of this chapter or of the order or
direction made pursuant thereto.
(Ord. 2106-34, passed 6-22-2021) Penalty, see §

§ 153.116 VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   In accordance with § 59.2(b) of C.F.R. 44, Chapter 1 of the National
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulation, to qualify for the sale of
federally-subsidized flood insurance, a community must adopt floodplain
management regulations that meet or exceed the minimum standards of § 60:
“These regulations must include effective enforcement provisions.”
   (B)   In accordance with § 60.1(b) of C.F.R. 44, Chapter 1 of the NFIP
regulations, “these regulations must be legally-enforceable, applied uniformly
throughout the community to all privately and publicly owned land within flood-
prone (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion areas, and the community must
provide that the regulations take precedence over less restrictive conflicting
local laws, ordinances or codes.”
   (C)   Therefore, no structure or land shall hereafter be constructed,
located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms
of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions
of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor and shall be punished pursuant to
SDCL § 7-18A-2. Each and every day of the continued violation may constitute a
separate offense. In addition to any fine and imprisonment for each violation,
violators shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the county from taking such other lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.001 ADOPTION.
   (A)   The 2009 Revised Zoning Ordinance for the county is hereby adopted.
   (B)   The “1995 Revised Zoning Ordinance of Lincoln County (LC-0-95-01)” is
hereby repealed, and all ordinances, resolutions, rules, and regulations in
conflict with the “2009 Revised Zoning Ordinance for Lincoln County” are hereby
repealed.
   (C)   Copies of the 2009 Revised Zoning Ordinance for the county shall be
filed with the County Auditor and Register of Deeds.
   (D)   The public may inspect the entire 2009 Revised Zoning Ordinance for
the county at the office of the County Auditor during regular business hours.
(Ord. 0904-05, passed 4-7-2009)
§ 154.002 TITLE.
   These regulations may be referred to as the “2009 Revised Zoning Ordinance
for Lincoln County.”
(Ord. 0904-05, passed 5-20-2009)
§ 154.003 PURPOSE.
   These regulations have been based upon the county’s Comprehensive
Development Plan, adopted on December 6, 2005 by the Board of County
Commissioners, and are in conformance with SDCL Chapter 11-2. These regulations
are designed to carry out the goals and objectives of the plan, but especially
to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic, and
other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate
light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue
concentration or scattering of population; and to encourage a distribution of
population or mode of land utilization that will facilitate the economical and
adequate provision of transportation, water, drainage, sewerage, schools,
parks, or other public requirements. These regulations have been made with
reasonable consideration to the character and intensity of the various land
uses and the need for public facilities and services that would develop from
those uses. These regulations are necessary for the best physical development
of the county. The regulations are intended to preserve and protect existing
property uses and values against adverse or unharmonious adjacent uses by
zoning all unincorporated land except those areas where joint zoning
jurisdiction has been granted to a municipality.
(Ord. 0904-05, passed 5-20-2009)
§ 154.004 GENERAL REGULATIONS.
   The following general regulations shall apply to all zoning districts:
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided, no building shall be erected, converted,
enlarged, reconstructed, or structurally altered, nor shall any structure or
land be used:
      (1)   Except for a purpose permitted in the district in which the
structure or land is located;
      (2)   Except in conformance with the height and minimum lot requirements,
and the parking and sign regulations, and any other applicable requirements of
the district in which the structure or land is located; and
      (3)   Except in conformance with any federal, state, or county codes as
may be applicable. Where these regulations and any other rules and regulations
conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall
prevail.
   (B)   The density and yard requirements of these regulations are minimum
regulations for each and every building existing at the effective date of these
regulations and for any building hereafter erected or structurally altered. No
land required for yards or other open spaces about an existing building or any
building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be considered a yard
or lot area for more than one building; and
   (C)   Every building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be
located on a lot as herein defined and in no case shall there be more than one
main building on a lot except as otherwise provided in these regulations.
Cooperatives, condominiums, and all other forms of property ownership do not
affect the provisions of these regulations and all requirements shall be
observed as though the property were under single ownership.
(Ord. 0904-05, passed 5-20-2009)
§ 154.005 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions, greater floods can and will occur, and flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the flood zone or uses permitted within such areas
will be free from flooding or flood damages. These regulations shall not create
liability on the part of the county or on any officer or employee thereof for
any flood damages that result from reliance on these regulations or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 0904-05, passed 5-20-2009)
§ 154.006 INTERPRETATION, ABROGATION, AND SEVERABILITY.
   In interpreting and applying the provisions of these regulations, they shall
be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public safety,
health, convenience, comfort, morals, prosperity, and general welfare. It is
not the intent to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where these regulations and other
regulations, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. All other
regulations inconsistent with these regulations are hereby repealed to the
extent of this inconsistency only. If any section, clause, provision, or
portion of these regulations is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court
of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of these regulations shall not be
affected thereby.
(Ord. 0904-05, passed 5-20-2009)
§ 154.007 SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   These regulations shall in no manner affect pending actions, either civil or
criminal, founded on or growing out of any regulations hereby repealed. These
regulations shall in no manner affect rights or causes of action, either civil
or criminal, not in suit that may have already accrued or grown out of any
regulations repealed.
(Ord. 0904-05, passed 5-20-2009)
§ 154.008 PURPOSE OF CATCH HEADS.

regulations are inserted simply for convenience to serve the purpose of an
index. The introductory statements found at the beginning of each article are

PD PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
§ 154.195 INTENT.
   (A)   It is the intent of this district to provide flexibility from
conventional zoning regulations with increased public review for PD Planned
Development District projects in order to:
      (1)   Encourage well planned, efficient development;
      (2)   Allow a planned and coordinated mix of land uses which are
compatible and are harmonious, but previously discouraged by conventional
zoning procedures;
      (3)   Encourage the redevelopment of contiguous large lot parcels into an
integrated and orderly subdivision pattern, with particular attention to
developing an efficient and coordinated network of internal streets;
      (4)   Promote the clustering of residential structures and other uses
without increasing overall density of the development area in order to preserve
unique and natural features such as woodlands, wetlands, natural drainage
systems, and scenic areas;
      (5)   Protect sensitive areas and areas with restrictive soil conditions
within development areas through clustering of uses on land more suited for
building;
      (6)   Reserve adequate public right-of-way within development areas for
the eventual extension of arterial and collector streets, including proper
width and spacing of such streets; and
      (7)   Improve communication and cooperation among the county, townships,
land developers, and interested residents in the development of agricultural
land and redevelopment of existing areas.

APO AQUIFER PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICT
§ 154.215 INTENT.
   The District is intended to preserve the quality and quantity of the area’s
water resources so as to ensure a safe and adequate supply of drinking water
for present and future generations. Restrictions shall apply to land use
activities which have the potential to contaminate water resources, including
aquifers in use and those having the potential for future use as a public water
supply. The purpose of the district is to prohibit certain uses which pose the
greatest threat to ground water contamination and to impose reasonable and
adequate safeguards on other uses which exhibit a potential to contaminate the
ground water. The Aquifer Protection Overlay District is an overlay whose
boundaries are superimposed on all districts established by this chapter. It is
not intended that this district interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
rules or regulations of this chapter, except that if the Aquifer Protection
Overlay District imposes a greater restriction than the underlying zoning
district regulations, the greater restriction shall apply.
(Ord. 0904-05, passed 5-20-2009)
§ 154.216 ESTABLISHMENT/DELINEATION/REGULATION OF AN AQUIFER PROTECTION OVERLAY
DISTRICT.
   The boundaries of the Aquifer Protection Overlay District are shown upon the
map which has been made a part hereof by reference. The map shall be signed by
the Chairperson of the Board of County Commissioners and filed with the
county’s Register of Deeds. The map shall have the same force and effect as if
it were all fully set forth herein. The shallow/surficial aquifer boundary was
mapped using data from the state’s Geological Survey and the United States
Geological Survey. The map only serves as a general guide to the locations and
depths of the mapped aquifer units. Boundaries shown are general in nature and
may be modified in the future as site/area specific information is obtained.
Additional information shall be used whenever available to more precisely
determine aquifer locations and depths. Actual site-specific aquifer boundaries
and depths may differ from those shown on the map. The mapped boundaries are
drawn at the discretion of geologists and hydrologists based on best available
information. Site-specific hydrogeologic information may be necessary to verify
the location of a proposed use in relation to an underlying shallow aquifer.
Any applicant that is identified as being within the aquifer protection overlay
zone, as denoted on the map, can provide drilling logs from soil borings on
and/or near the site of the proposed use to conclusively prove that it is not
located above a shallow/surficial aquifer area. The standards utilized by the
state’s Department of Environment and Natural Resources for soil borings will
be followed.

   (F)   No advertising or display signs shall be permitted other than a
nameplate attached to the dwelling. The nameplate shall not be illuminated and
shall not be more than two square feet in area. No off-premises signs shall be
used.
   (G)   The occupation shall not require internal alterations or involve
construction features not customary in a dwelling. External alterations
intended to create a separate entrance or other feature exclusively for the
occupation is prohibited.
   (H)   There shall be only limited and incidental sale of products conducted
on the premises.
   (I)   The occupation shall not generate more than four visits per day from

      (5)   The applicant shall meet with the township supervisors of the
affected township to discuss repair and maintenance responsibilities on
township roads to be used as haul routes. A summary of the meeting(s) shall be
presented with the application.
   (D)   Fee. If a conditional use is granted, the operator shall pay to the
county an annual fee of $10 per acre of land which is being disturbed by the
extraction activities and has not been reclaimed. The fee shall be used to
defray the direct and indirect costs associated with general administration and
enforcement of this section. The fee shall be payable by January 20 of each
year and deposited in the general fund of the county. The disturbed land area
existing on January 1 of each year shall be used in calculating the fee.
   (E)   Notification requirements. In addition to the notification
requirements of §§
154.375 through
154.386, the Planning Director shall notify, by U.S. mail, all property owners
of record within one mile of the proposed conditional use area or the owners of
the 30 properties nearest to the affected property, whichever affects the least
number of owners, of the time, date, place, and purpose of the public hearing.
The notice shall be mailed not less than 15 days prior to the public hearing.
   (F)   Developmental and operational criteria. The following criteria shall
be considered in developing conditions for applications involving rock, sand,
and gravel extractions. More stringent requirements may be imposed by the
county or the applicant may present arguments to relax the requirements based
on specific characteristics of the site.
      (1)   Buffer area. A minimum distance of 1,000 feet should be maintained
between an existing residence and a rock, sand, or gravel operation, except in
those instances when the operator secures a waiver from the affected landowner.
      (2)   Visual considerations.
         (a)   Earth berms and vegetation should be employed to minimize visual
impacts and reduce the effects of noise.
         (b)   The need for and placement of berms should be determined by the
orientation and position of the excavation site with respect to residences and
roadways. Berms should be located in such a way as to restrict the public’s
view of the property. Consideration should be given to placing the berms as
close to the public point of view as practical. Generally, berms should be six
feet in height and seeded immediately after construction to avoid soil erosion.
Berms should be maintained and kept reasonably free of weeds.
         (c)   The operator should work with the county’s Conservation District
and Planning Director to develop a planting program. The planting program
should be reduced to writing and kept on file in the Planning Office.
         (d)   At a minimum, berms should be constructed prior to blasting or
the extraction of rock, sand, or gravel.
      (3)   Air quality.
         (a)   Air quality monitoring should be conducted at the operator’s
expense when conditions warrant.
         (b)   Ambient air quality: total suspended particulate matter, 150
micrograms per cubic meter of air as a 24-hour average not to be exceeded more
than once per year, and 60 micrograms per cubic meter of air as an arithmetic
mean; PM10 (ten micrometers or less in size) consistent with the regulations of
the state.
         (c)   Employ techniques that minimize the release of particulate
matter created by material stockpiles, vehicular movement, and process
operations.
         (d)   Dust control agents should be applied to township gravel roads
designated as haul routes and all driving surfaces within the extraction area.
      (4)   Hydrology, dewatering, and drainage.
         (a)   Existing wells should be monitored at the operator’s expense to
document changes in hydrologic conditions around extraction sites.
         (b)   Dewatering of the extraction site should not result in
downstream flooding.
         (c)   Berms should not interrupt the natural drainage of the area,
unless such diversion is part of an approved drainage control system.
      (5)   Haul roads.
         (a)   In order to minimize the negative impact of truck traffic on
area residents, extraction operations should be located on or near existing
hard surfaced roads. Consideration should be given to the number of residents
located along gravel surfaced roads intended for use as haul roads.
         (b)   Identify repair and maintenance responsibilities through a haul
road agreement.
         (c)   Consider the potential impact on county highways to be used as
haul routes.
      (6)   Operator surety.
         (a)   A surety bond should be filed with the County Auditor to protect
the county in the event the operator abandons a site without completing the
conditions imposed by the conditional use, including fulfillment of the
agreement with the township concerning repair of designated haul roads.
         (b)   In lieu of the required surety, the operator may deposit cash
with the county in the amount equal to the required surety.
      (7)   Reclamation.
         (a)   The type and extent of reclamation should be based on the type
of material extracted on the intended post-mining land use, but in all cases
the reclamation procedures should result in the rehabilitation of affected land
through contouring and soil stabilization, revegetation, and other appropriate
means so as to create the least amount of unsightliness and most appropriate
future use of the reclaimed area. Bodies of water may be incorporated into an
acceptable reclamation plan.
         (b)   Provide maps, including cross sections, showing the existing
natural topography and anticipated topographic conditions upon completion of
reclamation.
         (c)   Grading should achieve a contour that is most beneficial to the
proposed future land use. All berms should be removed where sand and gravel
operations were conducted. In most cases involving quarry operations, the berms
should remain in place unless their removal would serve a more useful purpose.
         (d)   Topsoil should remain on site and be used during reclamation.
         (e)   A seeding and revegetation plan should be developed for the
affected area in consultation with the county’s Conservation District.
         (f)   All required reclamation activities should be completed and a
compliance inspection performed by the Planning Director prior to the release
of the surety.
      (8)   Additional considerations.
         (a)   The maximum height of a bench in a quarry should be 30 feet.
         (b)   The property should be secured during non-working hours by means
of gates and fencing. The property should continue to be secured until all
required reclamation activities have been completed.

   (D)   Waste management plan.
      (1)   Any facility for which a conditional use permit (CUP) is required
shall have a waste management plan (WMP). Waste application provisions can be
found under division (E) below. The WMP shall be prepared with the assistance
of an engineer, licensed in the state, or other qualified professional (at the
applicant’s expense); be in writing; be approved as an adjunct to the CUP; and
be updated or amended periodically to conform to facility operating conditions
or requirements. In addition, an engineer that is licensed in the state shall
approve and sign off on all building and waste storage facility plans
associated with the concentrated animal feeding operation.
      (2)   Class A and B concentrated animal feeding operations, as defined by
these regulations, shall be required to have the WMP reviewed and approved by
the state’s Department of Environment and Natural Resources. Waste management
plans for Class A, B, C, and D concentrated animal feeding operations may be
reviewed periodically by the Planning Commission, if deemed necessary. The
following minimum requirements (unless varied from or waived by the CUP) shall
apply.
         (a)   Pest and odor control shall be maintained using conscientious
methods, both as to the facility and the waste disposal site.
         (b)   Unless otherwise required by state or federal law, all waste
shall be collected in self-contained, enclosed pits, and transport equipment
conveying wastes to the disposal site shall be fully enclosed and structurally
sound to prevent leakage or spillage.
         (c)   The legal description of all tillable agricultural lands where
waste disposal is to be conducted. All waste produced from swine units must be
knifed or injected. Waste produced by any other animal site may be either
surface/irrigation applied or incorporated/injected.
         (d)   Written agreements with all owners of waste disposal sites
(other than those of the facility owner) for the use of such land for waste
disposal, with provision no such land shall be withdrawn from use without
written notice to the Planning Commission. Contracts shall be for a minimum
three-year time period.
         (e)   Waste disposal at all sites shall meet the following separation
distance requirements:

   (E)   Transportation of manure into the county. Any landowner within the A-
l Agricultural District receiving and utilizing manure generated from a
concentrated animal feeding operation not permitted by the county shall provide
the county with a complete waste management plan, and shall comply with all
provisions of §
154.250. Furthermore, the animal manure shall be applied to the land in a
manner consistent with §
154.250.
   (F)   Minimum separation distances.
      (1)   The facility shall be sited not closer than those distances
indicated in division (F)(2) below. These setbacks are minimum standards that
may be increased by the Planning Commission during the conditional use permit
issuance process due to concerns or circumstances unique to a specific
concentrated animal feeding operation permit application. Setbacks shall be
measured from the outermost point of the feedlot to the structure/use as
identified in division (F)(2) below.
      (2)   If an applicant wishes to place a concentrated animal feeding
operation closer than the separation distances set forth in these regulations,
the applicant can request an exception for the separation distance from the
Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may allow an exception from the
separation distance only when the applicant obtains waivers from all the owners
of property within the separation distance. Any authorized person, business, or
governmental entity that is within the separation distance may waive the
separation distance through a written instrument to be filed with the county’s
Register of Deeds. This waiver would run with the land.

§ 154.251 TEMPORARY USES.
   (A)   Intent.
      (1)   The requirements of this section are intended to provide for the
regulation and permitting of uses and associated improvements on private
property which have only a temporary duration and are not so recurring in
nature as to constitute a permanent use.
      (2)   These requirements are not intended to regulate temporary uses on
public property, including public rights-of-way.
   (B)   Permit required. No person shall operate a temporary use without first
obtaining a permit therefor from the Planning Commission as prescribed in this
section. If an appeal is filed pursuant to division (G) below, the Planning
Director shall present the Planning Commission’s decision to the Board of
County Commissioners for review.
   (C)   Applications.
      (1)   Submission deadline. All applications for a temporary use permit
shall be made at least 90 days prior to the proposed commencement date of the
use.
      (2)   Temporary use plan. All temporary uses shall be subject to approval
of a temporary use plan. The plan shall describe the nature and location of all
temporary improvements and activities, the location of any permanent buildings
intended to be used, the time period for which the temporary use permit is
requested, and such other information in sufficient detail as the Planning
Department determines is reasonably necessary to adequately review the
application and to ensure the use will be conducted in a manner consistent with
the requirements of this section.
   (D)   Standards for review. The following standards shall be used in
determining the suitability and compatibility of a temporary use:
      (1)   The temporary use will have no unreasonable adverse effect on
nearby properties or jeopardize public health, safety, and general welfare, and
is compatible with the purpose and intent of this chapter and the specific
zoning district in which it is located;
      (2)   The temporary use will not create hazardous traffic conditions or
result in traffic in excess of the capacity of the roads serving the use;
      (3)   The site is adequate to accommodate the proposed use, including the
provision for on- and off-site parking;
      (4)   Adequate sanitation facilities will be available on the site;
      (5)   The time period and hours of operation for the temporary use are
clearly specified;
      (6)   Provision is made for the removal, clean-up, and restoration of the
site;
      (7)   The temporary use will not adversely impact the natural
environment;
      (8)   The site is suitable for the proposed temporary use, considering
flood hazard, drainage, soils, and other conditions which may constitute a
danger to life, health, or property; and
      (9)   All temporary improvements and any permanent structures proposed to
be used will comply with all applicable provisions of the county’s Building

§ 154.252 TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS, ANTENNA SUPPORT STRUCTURES, AND WIRELESS
COMMUNICATION FACILITIES.
   (A)   Intent and purpose.
      (1)   The unique and diverse landscapes of the county are among its most
valuable assets. Destroying these assets risks undermining the very
characteristics responsible for our economic vitality and future potential.
Protecting these assets will require that location and design of tower
facilities be sensitive to, and in scale and harmony with, the aesthetics of
the county. This section will provide standards for the proper placement and
design of tower facilities in order to ensure their compatibility with
surrounding aesthetics and development.
      (2)   The purpose of this section is to provide predictable and balanced
standards for the siting and screening of tower facilities on both public and
private property within the jurisdiction of the county. These standards will
protect the health, safety, and general welfare of persons in the area(s)
surrounding such tower facilities from possible adverse aesthetics related to
the placement, construction, or modification of such tower facilities.
         (a)   Leasing of public buildings, publicly owned structures, and/or
public rights-of-way for the purposes of locating wireless telecommunication
services facilities and/or equipment is encouraged.
         (b)   In cases where a facility is proposed on county property,
specific locations and compensation to the county shall be negotiated in lease
agreements between the county and the provider on a case-by-case basis, and
would be subject to all of the review criteria contained in this section.
         (c)   Such agreements would not provide exclusive arrangements that
could tie up access to the negotiated site(s) or limit competition, and must
allow for the possibility of “co-locating” (sharing of facilities) with other
providers.
      (3)   Regulations regarding development of telecommunications towers,
antenna support structures, and wireless communications facilities are intended
to encourage development of a competitive wireless communications market place
while protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the public and maintaining
the aesthetic integrity of the county. The regulations cover placement,
construction, and modification of telecommunications towers, antenna support
structures, and wireless communications facilities. The intent of this section
includes the following:
         (a)   To regulate the location of telecommunication towers, antenna
support structures, and wireless communication facilities;
         (b)   To protect residential areas and land uses from potential
adverse impact of telecommunications towers, antenna support structures, and
wireless communication facilities;
         (c)   To minimize adverse visual impact of tower sites through design,
siting, landscaping, and innovate camouflaging techniques;
         (d)   To promote shared use and co-location of sites;
         (e)   To ensure telecommunications towers, antenna support structures,
and wireless communication facilities are compatible with surrounding land
uses;
         (f)   To facilitate the provision of services to residents and
businesses in an orderly fashion;
         (g)   To promote the location of telecommunications towers, antenna
support structures, and wireless communication facilities in non-residential
areas; and
         (h)   To avoid potential damage to property caused by
telecommunications towers, antenna support structures, and wireless
communication facilities by ensuring that such structures are soundly and
carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained, and removed when no
longer used or when determined to be structurally unsound. Specifically, the
Telecommunication Act of 1996, being Pub. L. No. 104-104, affirms the local
government’s right to control the siting, construction, and modification of
cellular and other wireless telecommunication facilities. The permitting
process of this section will not discriminate among providers of functionally
equivalent services and will not prohibit the provisions of personal wireless
services.
   (B)   Applicability. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or
corporation to erect, construct in place, or place any tower facility without
first receiving a permit(s) from the county’s Planning and Zoning Office, nor
may any person, firm, or corporation alter, modify, transform, add to, or
change in any way an existing tower facility without first receiving a permit
(s) from the county’s Planning and Zoning Office.
   (C)   Co-location requirements for new tower facilities.
      (1)   New tower facilities shall be designed and constructed to permit
the future co-location of other commercial wireless telecommunications
services, according to the following criteria:
 
Height of Structure           Additional Users Facility Must Accommodate
Less than 100 feet            No co-location required
Between 100 feet and 130 feet One additional user accommodated
Between 130 feet and 160 feet Two additional users accommodated
161 feet and greater          Three additional users accommodated
 
      (2)   In satisfying co-location requirements, the owner of the tower must
provide adequate access to the tower site and space within the owned or leased
area to accommodate co-location user’s equipment. Nothing in these regulations
shall prevent the owner of the tower from requiring remuneration from a co-
location user, provided that such remuneration is rate reasonable. The owner of
the tower may also establish reasonable technical requirements for co-location
to protect the owner’s investment and guarantee effective telecommunication
service. The owner of the tower shall have the authority to review all plans
for co-location uses and require reasonable modifications for such plans to
ensure safe and efficient operations of the communication services and protect
the owner’s investment.
   (D)   General standards.
      (1)   Setback. There shall be a minimum setback of 600 feet from the
tower base to any existing residence or proposed residential development area
based on the land use plan except the farmstead residence on the proposed site.
Building structures must meet county setback requirements. Towers shall be no
more than 200 feet in height. Towers exceeding 200 feet may be considered, if
FCC and FAA approval is received.
      (2)   Fencing. The tower facility shall be protected by a security fence
from six feet to eight feet in height around the perimeter of the site.
      (3)   Signage. The owner’s name, telephone number, and site ID number
shall be posted on the gate of a perimeter fence. No other advertising or
identification sign of any kind is permitted on the tower facility, except
applicable warning and equipment information as required by the manufacturer or
by federal, state, or local authorities.
      (4)   Lighting. The light source for any necessary security lighting
shall feature down-directional, sharp cut-off luminaries that ensure there is
no spillage of illumination off the parcel or easement boundary. Towers shall
be of a monopole design unless it is determined that an alternative design
would be appropriate for the particular site or circumstance. All sites and
equipment shall be maintained in good condition, order, and repair so they
shall not endanger the life or property of any person.
   (E)   Application requirements.
      (1)   The county’s Planning and Zoning Office may contract with an
independent technical expert to review technical materials submitted by the
applicant and/or to determine if additional information is necessary. The tower
facility applicant shall pay the cost of such review and/or independent
analysis.
      (2)   Name and address of the tower facility owner, record landowner of
parcel, and any duly appointed agents of the parties.
      (3)   A visual study depicting where within a one-mile radius any portion
of the proposed tower facility will be visible.

proposed broadcast coverage obtained by the tower facility, including a
narrative describing a search radius of not less than one mile for the
requested site, clearly explaining why the site was selected, identifying, and
locating landing and takeoff areas of aircraft within the search radius,
locating all existing tower facilities, and identifying all other structures
that may be potential co-location sites.
      (7)   Description of the tower facility design (for example, monopole).
      (8)   An affidavit attesting to the fact that the applicant made
diligent, but unsuccessful, efforts to obtain permission for installation at a
co-location facility.
      (9)   Written, technical evidence from an engineer(s) that the proposed
tower or communication facility cannot be co-located to other tower sites.
      (10)   Written, technical evidence that an engineer registered in the
state has provided the design for this specific tower facility and site
ensuring the proper standards for design.
   (F)   Other requirements.
      (1)   The county may require additional information from the applicant
and impose additional standards, regulations, or requirements as deemed
necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. If the Planning
Commission considers the information provided inadequate or if the applicant
fails to supply required information, the Planning Commission may deny the
application on this basis.

         (f)   The applicant shall submit proof, in the form of a signed
affidavit, demonstrating a good faith effort to lease or purchase space on an
adjacent existing tower facility. The affidavit shall state why space is not
available, such as:
            1.   The planned tower facility would exceed the structural
capacity of the tower facility and the structural capacity cannot reasonably be
increased;
            2.   The planned tower facility would cause interference with the
usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower facility; and/or
            3.   An existing tower facility cannot accommodate the planned
antenna at a height necessary to function reasonably.
   (G)   Exemptions. Towers exempt from the permitting process include the
following:
      (1)   Residential use no more than ten feet above average existing tree
canopy or roof line; and
      (2)   Normal maintenance to existing tower facilities.
   (H)   Annual notification - failure to comply deemed abandonment.
      (1)   The owner of the facility shall file an annual notification in
writing to the Planning and Zoning Office as to the current operation of the
tower facility.
      (2)   This annual report due on or before January 15 of each year shall
include, but not be limited to, the following information:
         (a)   Tower usage: type of usage, tower in service or out of service;
         (b)   Documentation of antenna: number of co-locates;

         (d)   Annual maintenance performed; and
         (e)   Any changes from the original conditional use permit.
      (3)   Failure to comply with this section will deem the tower facility
abandoned.
   (I)   Abandonment.
      (1)   Tower facilities that are not in use for 180 consecutive days shall
be considered abandoned and shall be removed by the owner within 180 days. The
applicant must furnish a copy of the relevant portion of an executed lease,
which identifies the applicant’s obligation to remove abandoned or unused
towers, concrete footings, anchors, supporting equipment, and antennae prior to
the issuance of a conditional use permit to erect a tower.
      (2)   Removal includes the complete tower facility, including related
infrastructures, footings, and other underground improvements to a depth of 36
inches below existing grade, and restoration to pre-existing vegetative cover.
Failure to do so shall be just cause for the county to seek legal avenues that
will remove the tower facility and restore the site.
      (3)   The county shall require financial assurances, including bonds in
an amount sufficient to cover costs of removal of towers, buildings, concrete
footings, anchors, supporting equipment, and antennae. Said financial
assurances shall be submitted with the conditional use permit application. An
engineer’s cost estimate is to assist the county in determining the amount of
financial assurance necessary to cover removal costs of said towers, buildings,
concrete footings, anchors, supporting equipment, and antennae.
      (4)   In the event any towers, buildings, concrete footings, anchors,

written notice by the county after abandonment, the county shall have the right
to remove the towers, buildings, concrete footings, anchors, supporting
equipment, and antennae and assess the property.
   (J)   Existing tower facilities. Existing tower facilities may continue in
use and perform routine maintenance for the purpose now used and may not alter,
convert, modify, transform, vary, add to, or change in any way the form without
complying with this section. Existing tower facilities shall be considered for
the co-location of other antenna(s). The owner of an existing tower facility
shall file an annual notification in writing to the Planning and Zoning Office
as to the continuing operation of every tower facility constructed (see
division (H) above). Failure to do so shall be determined to mean that the
tower facility is no longer in use and considered abandoned.
   (K)   Maintenance.
      (1)   All tower facilities shall be maintained in a safe and clean
manner. The tower facility owner shall be responsible for maintaining a
graffiti, debris, and litter-free site. The landscape plan shall be maintained
for the life of the tower facility. Trimming the tops of trees on the site
shall be allowed only to maintain the average height of the canopy used to
establish tower facility height. All tower facilities shall be subject to
periodic inspection to ensure continuing compliance with all conditions of the
application submitted and approval requirements.
      (2)   Telecommunications towers, antenna support structures, and wireless
communications facilities shall be maintained in compliance with Electronic
Industries Association/Telecommunications Industries Associations Standards
(latest revision), all applicable laws, and so as not to interfere with the use

   The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall not vary the regulations unless it
shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific
case that all of the following conditions are present:
   (A)   The particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved would result in a particular
hardship upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the
strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out;
   (B)   The conditions upon which the application for a variance is based
would not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoning
classification or other property substantially similar in use;
   (C)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the area in which the
property is located;

of light and air to adjacent property, increase the congestion in the public
streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or diminish
or impair property values within the area;
   (E)   Because of circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that
the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the
zoning regulations and that the authorization of a variance is therefore
necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
   (F)   The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that
will afford reasonable relief and will represent the least modification
desirable of the zoning regulations;

height limits as established by these regulations; and
   (H)   The Board of Adjustment, under its authority to grant variances may

   The 2006 Joint Zoning Regulations for the county and the City of Sioux Falls
are hereby adopted. The 2006 Joint Zoning Regulations and associated Official
Zoning Map are on file with the County Auditor and the Sioux Falls City Clerk.
(Ord. 0601-31, passed 1-23-2006)
§ 155.002 TITLE.
These regulations shall be referred to as the Joint Zoning Regulations for
Lincoln County and the City of Sioux Falls.
(Ord. 1709-39, passed 9-26-2017)
§ 155.003 PURPOSE.
   These regulations have been based upon the following land use regulatory
tools: 1) the Sioux Falls 2040 Comprehensive Development Plan adopted by the
Board of County Commissioners on April 25, 2017, and the City Council on
October 11, 2016, and as amended by the City Council (April 18, 2017); and 2)
the Lincoln County Comprehensive Plan as adopted by the Board of County
Commissioners on September 27, 2004. All of the aforementioned land use
regulatory tools are in conformance with Chapters 11-2, 11-4, and 11-6 of the
South Dakota Compiled Laws. These regulations shall establish a common working
relationship between Lincoln County and the City of Sioux Falls to carry out
the goals and objectives of the plan as adopted by the County and City, but
especially to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire,
panic, and other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide
adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue
concentration or scattering of population; and to encourage a distribution of
population or mode of land utilization that will facilitate the economical and
adequate provisions of transportation, roads, water supply, drainage,
sanitation, education, recreation, or other public requirements. The
regulations are intended to preserve and protect existing property uses and
values against adverse or unharmonious adjacent uses by zoning land outside the
corporate boundaries of the City of Sioux Falls.
(Ord. 1709-39, passed 9-26-2017)

without increasing overall density of the development area in order to preserve
unique and natural features such as woodlands, wetlands, natural drainage
systems, and scenic areas.
   (E)   Protect sensitive areas and areas with restrictive soil conditions
within development areas through clustering of uses on land more suited for
building.
   (F)   Reserve adequate public right-of-way within development areas for the
eventual extension of arterial and collector streets, including proper width
and spacing of such streets.
   (G)   Improve communication and cooperation among the county, townships,
land developers, and interested residents in the development of agricultural
land and redevelopment of existing areas.
   (H)   Development shall coincide with completion of proper municipal and
utility improvements.

requirements around the lot for the district in which the tract or lot is
located.
   (B)   Adjustments to front yard requirements. Where, on the effective date
of these regulations, 40% or more of a frontage was occupied by two or more
buildings, then the front yard is established in the following manner:
      (1)   Where the building furthermost from the street provides a front
yard not more than ten feet deeper than the building closest to the street,
then the front yard for the frontage is and remains an average of the then
existing front yards.
      (2)   Where division (1) is not the case and a lot is within 100 feet of
a building on each side, then the front yard is a line drawn from the closest
front corners of these two adjacent buildings.
      (3)   Where neither division (1) nor (2) is the case, and the lot is
within 100 feet of an existing building on one side only, then the front yard
is the same as that of the existing adjacent building.

§ 155.150 ROCK, SAND, AND GRAVEL EXTRACTION.
   (A)   Intent.
      (1)   This section addresses the application, review, and regulation of
extraction and onsite processing of rock, sand, and gravel. An applicant must
meet certain requirements as specified in division (C) when filing for a
conditional use permit in addition to the general requirements contained in
other sections of the zoning regulations.
      (2)   The developmental and operational criteria contained in division
(G) are intended to assist in the formulation of conditions to be imposed on
individual extraction operations. The criteria have been designed to eliminate
potential health risks and minimize the adverse impact on other land uses due
to extraction operations.
      (3)   The county and city will have the discretion of requiring more or
less stringent conditions based upon the location of a proposed operation. It
is also recognized that such operations will not be appropriate throughout all
areas of the joint zoning jurisdiction.
   (B)   Submission of application. The application for rock, sand, or gravel
extraction shall be filed with the office of planning and zoning on the
prescribed conditional use form at least 30 days in advance of a regularly
scheduled joint meeting of the Planning Commissions.
   (C)   Application. The conditional use application shall be accompanied by
the following:
      (1)   Maps showing the area within which the extraction operations will
be conducted, including areas to be disturbed, setbacks from property lines,
and the location of all structures, equipment, and access and haul roads.
      (2)   A description of the surface land use and vegetation, including all
pertinent physical characteristics.
      (3)   A hydrologic study which shall include all available information
from the State Geological Survey and other information pertinent to the
application. If the applicant believes a study is not warranted, documentation
shall accompany the application in support of this position.
      (4)   A reclamation plan which takes into consideration the criteria
listed in division (F)(10) of this section.
      (5)   The applicant shall meet with the township supervisors of the
affected township to discuss repair and maintenance responsibilities on
township roads to be used as haul routes. A summary of the meeting(s) shall be
presented with the application.
   (D)   Fee. If a conditional use permit is granted, the operator shall pay to
the county an annual fee of $10 per acre of land which is being disturbed by
the extraction activities and has not been reclaimed. The fee shall be used to
defray the direct and indirect costs associated with general administration and
enforcement of this section. The fee shall be payable by January 20 of each
year and deposited in the general fund of the county. The disturbed land area
existing on January 1 of each year shall be used in calculating the fee.
   (E)   Notification requirements. In addition to the notification
requirements of §§
155.200 through
155.212, the Planning Director shall notify by U.S. mail all property owners of
record within one mile of the proposed conditional use area or the owners of
the 30 properties nearest to the affected property, whichever affects the least
number of owners, of the time, date, place and purpose of the public hearing.
The notice shall be mailed not less than 15 days prior to the public hearing.
   (F)   Developmental and operational criteria. The following criteria shall
be considered in developing conditions for applications involving rock, sand,
and gravel extractions. More stringent requirements may be imposed by the
county and city or the applicant may present arguments to relax the
requirements based on specific characteristics of the site.
      (1)   Buffer area.
         (a)   A minimum distance of 1,000 feet should be maintained between an
existing residence and a rock, sand, or gravel operation, except in those
instances when the operator secures a waiver from the affected landowner.
      (2)   Hours of operation.
         (a)   Monday through Friday - 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Saturday - 8:00
a.m. to 12:00 noon. Operations should not be conducted on legal holidays.
Activities such as office or maintenance operations which produce no noise off-
site should not be restricted by the hours of operation.
         (b)   Blasting should be scheduled on weekdays at 12:00 noon. There
should be no blasting on legal holidays. Area residents should be notified of
the date and time of each blast.
      (3)   Visual considerations.
         (a)   Earth berms and vegetation should be employed to minimize visual
impacts and reduce the effects of noise.
         (b)   The need for and placement of berms should be determined by the
orientation and position of the excavation site with respect to residences and
roadways. Berms should be located in such a way as to restrict the public's
view of the property. Consideration should be given to placing the berms as
close to the public point of view as practical. Generally, berms should be six
feet in height and seeded immediately after construction to avoid soil erosion.
Berms should be maintained and kept reasonably free of weeds.
         (c)   The operator should work with the County Conservation District
and County Planning Director to develop a planting program. Consideration
should be given to planting one or more of the following: evergreen, Russian
olive, ash, caragana, crab apple, lilac, and buffalo berry. The plants should
be properly cared for to ensure the highest survival rate and all dead plants
replaced during the current planting season. As a minimum, the program should
include trees of varying maturity. The planting program should be reduced to
writing and kept on file in the County Planning Department.
         (d)   At a minimum, berms should be constructed prior to blasting or
the extraction of rock, sand, or gravel.
      (4)   Blasting.
         (a)   Ground vibration and over pressure (air blast) should be
monitored for each blast and not exceed guidelines established by the U.S.
Bureau of Mines.
      (5)   Noise.
         (a)   The noise level produced from rock, sand, and gravel operations
should not exceed an average of 55 decibels recorded over a ten-minute period
measured at the nearest existing residence to the extraction operation. Off-
site activities which contribute to background noise levels should be taken
into consideration when monitoring an operation. Blasting should not be
recorded as part of the noise level.
      (6)   Air quality.
         (a)   Air quality monitoring should be conducted at the operator's
expense when conditions warrant.
         (b)   Ambient air quality: total suspended particulate matter-150
micrograms per cubic meter of air as a 24-hour average not to be exceeded more
than once per year, and 60 micrograms per cubic meter of air as an arithmetic
mean;
            PM10 (ten micrometers or less in size) consistent with the
regulations of the State of South Dakota.
         (c)   Employ techniques that minimize the release of particulate
matter created by material stockpiles, vehicular movement, and process
operations.
         (d)   Dust control agents should be applied to township gravel roads
designated as haul routes and all driving surfaces within the extraction area.
      (7)   Hydrology, dewatering, and drainage.
         (a)   Existing wells should be monitored at the operator's expense to
document changes in hydrologic conditions around extraction sites.
         (b)   Dewatering of the extraction site should not result in
downstream flooding.
         (c)   Berms should not interrupt the natural drainage of the area,
unless such diversion is part of an approved drainage control system.
      (8)   Haul roads.
         (a)   In order to minimize the negative impact of truck traffic on
area residents, extraction operations should be located on or near existing
hard surfaced roads. Consideration should be given to the number of residents
located along gravel surfaced roads intended for use as haul roads.
         (b)   Identify repair and maintenance responsibilities through a haul
road agreement.
         (c)   Consider the potential impact on county highways to be used as
haul routes.
      (9)   Operator surety.
         (a)   A surety performance bond may be required in an amount to be
determined by the Planning Commissions to assure that sufficient funds will be
available to protect the county and city in the event the operator abandons a
site without completing the conditions imposed by the conditional use permit,
including reclamation, fulfillment of the agreement with the township
concerning repair of designated haul roads and, if necessary, decontamination
of affected ground and surface waters. In lieu of the required surety, the
operator may deposit cash with the county in the amount equal to the required
surety.
      (10)   Reclamation.
         (a)   The type and extent of reclamation should be based on the type
of material extracted on the intended post-mining land use, but in all cases
the reclamation procedures should result in the rehabilitation of affected land
through contouring and soil stabilization, revegetation, and other appropriate
means so as to create the least amount of unsightliness and most appropriate
future use of the reclaimed area. Bodies of water may be incorporated into an
acceptable reclamation plan.
         (b)   Provide maps, including cross sections, showing the existing
natural topography and anticipated topographic conditions upon completion of
reclamation.
         (c)   Grading should achieve a contour that is most beneficial to the
proposed future land use. All berms should be removed where sand and gravel
operations were conducted. In most cases involving quarry operations, the berms
should remain in place unless their removal would serve a more useful purpose.
         (d)   Topsoil should remain on site and be used during reclamation.
         (e)   A seeding and revegetation plan should be developed for the
affected area in consultation with the County Conservation District.
         (f)   All required reclamation activities should be completed and a
compliance inspection performed by the County Planning Director prior to the
release of the surety.
      (11)   Additional considerations.
         (a)   The maximum height of a bench in a quarry should be 30 feet.
         (b)   The property should be secured during non-working hours by means
of gates and fencing. The property should continue to be secured until all
required reclamation activities have been completed.

connection with the approval of any temporary use permit which are deemed
necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare and the social and
economic well-being of those who will use the temporary use, residents and
landowners immediately adjacent to the proposed use, and the community as a
whole. Any condition imposed must be clearly specified in writing on the
temporary use permit.
   (H)   Appeal of Planning Department or Planning Commission decision. Any
person aggrieved by an action of the County Planning Department in granting,
denying, revoking, or suspending a temporary use permit may appeal such action
to the Planning Commissions. Such appeal shall be in writing and filed with the
County Planning Department within five working days of the decision. The action
of the Planning Commissions may be appealed to the Board of County
Commissioners and City Council in the same manner.

manner that only one sign facing located within the above spacing distance is
visible from the road right-of-way at any one time.

the use does not conform to the provisions thereof.
§ 151.193 CHANGE IN NONCONFORMING USES.
   If no structural alterations or additions are made, a nonconforming use may

specific consideration:
   (A)   Effect on surrounding property values.
   (B)   The density of land use zoning for the subject and adjacent
properties.
   (C)   The degree of hardship upon the applicant which would be caused by

entire premises for said use prior to the adoption, revision, or amendment of
this chapter.
§ 155.195 RESTORATION AFTER DAMAGE.
   When the use of a building is nonconforming as defined by this chapter and
such a building is damaged by a fire, explosion, act of God, or the public
enemy to the extent of more than 60% of its fair market value, it shall not be
restored except in conformity with the provisions of the district in which the
building is located.
   Exception. Single-family dwellings may be restored if damaged less than
100%.
§ 155.196 DISCONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING USE.

year, any subsequent use shall thereafter be in conformity with the regulations
of the district in which it is located.

if such changes do not encroach into an existing front yard, side yard, or rear
yard which is less than the minimum required yards for the district in which
they are located.
   (C)   Enlargement, extension, conversion of buildings or structures may
otherwise be made if such changes comply with the minimum required yards, lot
area, height, landscaping, parking, and density for the district in which they

thirds of the City Council.
§ 155.206 EXPIRATION.
   A conditional use permit which has been approved shall expire by limitation
and become null and void if the building, work or use authorized by such
conditional use permit is not commenced within one year from the date of
approval. This provision shall not apply to a conditional use permit approved
for a residential use in the A-1 or RC zoning districts. Upon written request

§ 155.207 CONDITIONAL USE CRITERIA.
   The following considerations shall be employed when acting upon requests for
conditional uses:
   (A)   The impact of the proposed use on adjacent properties shall be a major
consideration. The proposed use should be generally compatible with adjacent
properties and other properties in the district.
   (B)   Measures shall be taken to ensure that the proposed use does not alter
the general character of the area or neighborhood.
   (C)   The effects of noise, odor, traffic, air and water pollution, and
other negative factors shall be eliminated or controlled through the use of
screening, setbacks, and orientation.
   (D)   The proposed use shall not adversely affect the public.
§ 155.208 PREEXISTING USES.
   An existing use eligible for a conditional use permit which was lawfully
established on the effective date of this title shall be deemed to have
received a conditional use permit as herein required and shall be provided with
such permit by the county upon request, and it shall not be a nonconforming
use; provided, however, for any enlargement, extension, or relocation of such
existing use, an application in conformance with this chapter shall be
required.
§ 155.209 REAPPLICATION.
   No applicant requesting a conditional use permit whose application includes
the same or substantially the same requirements for the same or substantially
the same property as that which has been denied by the Planning Commissions or
the Board of County Commissioners and City Council shall be again considered by
the Planning Commissions before the expiration date of six months from the date
of the final action on the application.
§ 155.210 REVOCATION.
   If the Planning Director finds that at any time that the terms, conditions,
or requirements of the conditional use permit have not been complied with, or
that any phase thereof has not been completed within the time required under
the permit or any amendment thereto, the Planning Director shall report this
fact to the permittee, landowner, and/or operator, and the County and City
Planning Commissions. The County and City Planning Commissions may, after
conducting a public hearing, of which the permittee, landowner, and/or operator
shall be notified, make a recommendation to the Board of County Commissioners
and the City Council for their consideration and action. The Board of County
Commissioners and the City Council may, after conducting a public hearing, of
which the permittee, landowner, and/or operator shall be notified, revoke the
conditional use permit for failure to comply with the terms, conditions, or
requirements of the permit.
§ 155.211 TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS AND ANTENNA SUPPORT STRUCTURES.
   Where a conditional use permit is required for approval of
telecommunications towers and antenna support structures, the following will be
considered:
   (A)   Design character.
      (1)   Telecommunications towers, antenna support structures, and
equipment buildings shall be compatible with the architectural style of the
surrounding built environment, considering exterior materials, roof form,
scale, mass, color, texture, and character. Equipment buildings may be located
underground where feasible. To prevent undue concentration of
telecommunications towers, consideration should be given to co-location as a
first alternative.
      (2)   Wireless communications facilities on new telecommunications tower
structures, antenna support structures, or co-located on existing
telecommunications towers shall minimize visual impact.
   (B)   Screening.
      (1)   A telecommunications tower site and tower base adjacent to
residential property, except when located in a farmstead, shall be provided
with a fence, wall, berm, or shrubbery of sufficient height and of a character
necessary to provide adequate visual screening. Where the adjacent property is
across public right-of-way from a telecommunications tower site, screening
shall be provided in all cases except when the right-of-way is an arterial
street.
      (2)   Existing vegetation and grades on the site shall be preserved as
much as possible. Natural growth around the property perimeter on large, wooded
lots may be considered a sufficient buffer to telecommunications towers. In
locations where the visual impact of the telecommunications tower would be
minimal, the screening requirement may be reduced or waived.
   (C)   Fencing. Adjacent to a residentially used or zoned property, natural
materials shall be used for fence screening. If chain-link fencing is needed
for safety and security, additional landscape screening shall be required
outside the chain-link fence to screen public view of the telecommunications
tower site.
§ 155.212 BROADCAST TOWER.
   Location of the tower shall be done with consideration for public safety in
the event that the tower would fall and to minimize adverse visual impact of
broadcast towers through careful design, siting, and screening. Care should be
taken to avoid interference with any similar broadcast use and in no event
shall such tower be located in any airport approach zone. The tower shall be
constructed in a manner that will make it inaccessible for unauthorized persons
to climb.
AMENDMENTS TO THE REGULATIONS
§ 155.220 APPLICATION TO COUNTY FOR ZONING AMENDMENT.
   (A)   Any person, firm or corporation desiring a change in regulations,

district classification to another zoning district classification, shall make

forwarded to them for public hearing as provided in these regulations. The
County Auditor shall cause to be published a notice of the time and place when
and where all persons interested shall be given a full, fair and complete
hearing. Said public hearing shall comply with the provisions of SDCL §§ 11-2,
11-4, and 11-6.
   (A)   Supplementary notice. Supplementary to the published notice, a sign(s)
to be provided by the Lincoln County Planning Department shall be posted on the
property at least seven days prior to the scheduled hearing.
   (B)   Hearing. Upon the day of such public hearing, the Board of County
Commissioners and the City Council shall review the decisions and
recommendations of their respective Planning Commissions on all applications
coming before them as provided in these regulations. The Board of County
Commissioners and the City Council must each vote in favor of the proposed
action before any changes or modifications are made in the regulations,
restrictions or zoning map.
   (C)   Protest. Twenty days after publication of the Board of County
Commissioners' and City Council's approval, the zoning district classification
change shall take effect unless the referendum be invoked, or unless a written
protest is filed with the County Auditor, signed by at least 40% of the owners
of equity in the lots or parcels located within 250 feet from any part of such
proposed district. A corporation shall be construed to be a sole owner; and
when parcels of land are in the name of more than one person, ownership
representation shall be in proportion to the number of signers who join in the
petition in relation to the number of owners. If a protest is filed, the
ordinance shall not become effective unless the ordinance is approved by a
resolution by two-thirds of the Board of County Commissioners and two-thirds of
the City Council.

shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific
case that all of the following conditions are present:
   (A)   The particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved would result in a particular
hardship upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the
strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out.
   (B)   The conditions upon which the application for a variance is based
would not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoning

welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the area in which the
property is located.

of light and air to adjacent property; increase the congestion in the public
streets; increase the danger of fire; endanger the public safety; or diminish
or impair property values within the area.
   (E)   That because of circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility
that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of
the zoning regulations and that the authorization of a variance is therefore
necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
   (F)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford reasonable relief and will represent the least modification
desirable of the zoning regulations.
   (G)   The Board shall hear and make determinations on variance to exceed the
height limits as established by these regulations.

lot is reduced by reason of a street opening or widening or other public
