(Ord. passed 3- -2006)
§ 50.42 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Materials handling and storage.
      (1)   The contractor shall be responsible for the safe handling and
storage of all materials furnished by them and shall replace, at their expense,
all such materials found defective in manufacture or damaged in transportation,
handling, or storage.
      (2)   Pipe, fittings, and accessories shall be loaded and unloaded by
lifting with hoists or skidding to avoid shock or damage. Under no circumstance
shall such materials be dropped. All material shall be stored in a neat and
orderly manner. Pipe shall be stored, to the greatest extent possible, in unit
packages or bundles, and shall be handled to prevent stress to bell joints and
prevent damage to bevel ends. In addition, materials shall be handled and
stored in accordance with manufacturer’s recommendations.
      (3)   If, in the opinion of the engineer, damage or defects in the
factory-applied external coatings on steel or ductile iron pipe and fittings
(including fire hydrants) can be repaired, then the contractor shall make said
repairs as follows.
         (a)   If approved by the engineer, the contractor may make repairs
when damage or defects occur in the factory-applied external epoxy or MegaBond
coatings supplied on steel or ductile iron pipe and fittings (including fire
hydrant risers and joint restraint devices). Coating repairs shall be made
using a high build, low temperature applicable, fast cure, liquid epoxy
coating. This epoxy coating material shall be DENSO Protal 7125 Repair
Cartridge in packaged two component tubes with dispensing gun.
         (b)   When high ambient temperatures (greater than 85 degrees
Fahrenheit) occur or when metal surface skin temperatures are high (greater
than 100 degrees Fahrenheit) such that use of the DENSO Protal 7125 Repair
Cartridge may be difficult due to the very short handling time of the material,
an alternate modified amine cured epoxy coating may be used. This alternate
coating shall be Tapecoat TC 7010 FS-Gray Fast Setting epoxy coating.
   (B)   Alignment and grade. Pipe shall be laid true to the line and grade
established on the drawings. Where the drawings indicate that the finished
ground surface elevations are to be modified from the existing elevations by
this or future construction, the contractor shall exercise care to ensure that
pipe, fittings, hydrants, valves and valve boxes are placed to the elevations
indicated on the plans.
   (C)   Underground obstructions. The contractor shall expose existing
underground obstructions shown on the plans or located in the field and shall
determine their elevations far enough in advance of pipe laying that the
proposed water main can be installed without the use of fittings at or near the
points of crossing. Wherever obstructions not shown on the plans are
encountered during the progress of the work and interfere with the proposed
horizontal or vertical alignment of the pipeline, the engineer will change the
plans and order a deviation in the line and/or grade, or may arrange for the
removal or relocation of the obstructions. The contractor shall not deviate
from plan line or grade without the engineer’s approval.
   (D)   Water main and sewer main/storm sewer separation.
      (1)   Vertical separation at crossings.
         (a)   Water mains may cross above sanitary and storm sewers with a
minimum vertical distance of 18 inches between the invert of the water main and
the top of the sewer. In these cases where the water main is above the sewer
and there is at least 18 inches of separation, then at the crossings one full
20 foot length of water pipe shall be centered on the crossing.
         (b)   A water main may cross above a sewer main with a vertical
separation of less than 18 inches, or below the sewer main if either the water
or sewer main is encased in PVC, ductile iron, or six inches of concrete for at
least ten feet each side of the crossing. If PVC or ductile iron is utilized as
encasement material, the ends shall be sealed with six inches of concrete.
         (c)   Water mains crossing under vitrified clay sewer pipes or
concrete sewer pipes shall be encased in six inches of concrete extending ten
feet either side of the crossing.
         (d)   The ten feet either side shall be measured from the outside wall
of the sewer to the end of the encasement and is not measured from the
centerline of the sewer main.
      (2)   Water main and sewer main/storm sewer horizontal separation.
         (a)   Water mains shall be constructed with ten feet of horizontal
separation from any existing sanitary or storm sewer or proposed sanitary or
storm sewer. The ten feet horizontal separation shall be the clear distance
(water pipe sidewall to sewer pipe sidewall) and not the centerline distance
between the utilities.
         (b)   The following installation requires engineer approval and is
appropriate for installations where the ten feet separation physically is not
possible.
            1.   A water main may be constructed closer than ten feet to a
sanitary or storm sewer if it is laid in a separate trench or it is laid in the
same trench and the water main is located on the opposite side on a bench of
undisturbed earth. In both cases, the elevation of the crown of the sewer has
to be at least 18 inches below the invert of the water main. The sewer main
shall be constructed of water main pipe (pressure class pipe) meeting the
requirements of §
50.41, and pressure tested for water tightness in accordance with AWWA
standards for leakage testing.
            2.   As an alternative to constructing the sewer with water main
pipe (pressure class pipe) and pressure testing the sewer, it would also be
acceptable to either encase the water or sewer main with six inches of concrete
or to encase either the water or sewer within a PVC or cast iron casing.
      (3)   Sanitary sewer manholes and storm sewers.
         (a)   Sanitary sewer manholes and storm sewer pipes and inlets are
considered to be sewers in regards to the above separation requirements.
         (b)   A water main can be constructed within the ten foot horizontal
separation from a storm sewer pipe or storm sewer inlet provided that the storm
sewer pipe is constructed with sealed joints. The pressure test shall be
maintained for a minimum of 30 minutes.
   (E)   Installation.
      (1)   (a)   Minimum cover depth from top of pipe to finished grade shall
be as follows.
 
Size of pipe (inches) Minimum cover (feet)
12 or less            6
14 to 18              5 1/2
20 or larger          5
 
         (b)   In the event adequate cover cannot be achieved, then, if
approved by the engineer, the water pipe may be insulated. Insulation may also
be required if adequate separation between a storm sewer or culvert and the
water pipe cannot be achieved.
      (2)   Cleaning shall be done as necessary so that the interior of all
water pipe and fittings is free from all dirt, cement, or other foreign
material before installation. Contact surfaces shall be wire brushed
immediately prior to jointing.
      (3)   Pipe cutting shall be done without damage to the pipe with saw or
abrasive wheel and shall be smooth, straight, and at right angles to the pipe
axis. Ends of pipe shall be dressed and beveled to remove roughness and sharp
corners.
      (4)   (a)   Laying and joining of PVC pipe shall be in accordance with
AWWA C900, AWWA C905, and AWWA C605, and with the pipe manufacturer’s
instructions.
         (b)   Pipe shall be laid with bell ends facing in the direction of
laying. Each pipe length shall be inspected for defects prior to being lowered
into the trench. All pipe and fittings shall be carefully lowered into the
trench piece by piece by means of pipe slings to prevent damage to the pipe
and/or coating. Full lengths of pipe shall be installed except where connecting
to appurtenances and fittings. The contractor shall leave an appurtenance or
fitting with a full length of pipe whenever possible.
         (c)   Water main pipe shall not be installed in frozen ground or in
water, and no water shall be allowed to run into or through the pipe.
         (d)   During the course of construction, a suitable stopper shall be
kept in the end of the pipe so as to prevent any dirt and/or water from
entering during the progress of the work at all times. Any dirt, loose
material, or cement mortar which may accumulate in the pipe shall be removed as
the work progresses.
         (e)   Push-on joints. The spigot end of field cut piping shall be cut
square and then beveled. Joint surfaces shall be cleaned and lubricated
immediately before completing the joint.
         (f)   Mechanical joints. Joints shall not be over-tightened. If an
effective seal is not obtained the joint shall be disassembled, cleaned
thoroughly, and reassembled. Where joint restraint devices are used with a
mechanical joint, the holes shall be carefully aligned to permit installation
of harness bolts. At mechanical joints, a beveled PVC spigot may not be used.
Rather, a non-beveled spigot shall be used for insertion into mechanical joint.
      (5)   Protection of the work. Once in place, the pipe shall have its open
end plugged to prevent soil, water, or other matter from entering the pipe.
      (6)   Pipe deflection. Deflection of the pipe or pipe joint shall not be
permitted except as approved by the engineer. Changes in horizontal and
vertical direction shall be achieved using standard fittings, fabricated
fittings, and/or high deflection pipe couplings specifically designed and
approved for use in joint deflection. The engineer may approve deflection of
the pipe or pipe joint if the engineer of record specifically designed for the
deflection and the deflection is approved by the pipe manufacturer.
      (7)   Fittings. Bends and tees shall be placed on a stable foundation,
which may require the use of concrete pads of equal size or larger than
specified for valves. Fittings shall be provided with thrust blocks, joint
restraining devices, and polyethylene encasement (where fittings which are not
epoxy coated) as specified herein.
      (8)   Couplings. Couplings shall be placed on a stable foundation and
shall be wrapped in polyethylene encasement as specified herein. Couplings
shall be approved by the pipe manufacturer for the use with the pipe and shall
be installed according to the coupling manufacturer’s recommendations.
      (9)   Thrust restraint.
         (a)   Thrust restraints in the form of concrete thrust blocks shall be
provided at tees, crosses, horizontal bends, plugs, caps, valves, fire
hydrants, and similar locations whether specifically indicated on the drawings
or not. Refer to subdivision (10) below regarding joint restraining device
installations for situations and fittings that require the use of joint
restraints in lieu of thrust blocks.
         (b)   Concrete thrust blocks shall have a thickness at the fitting
equal to at least half the diameter of the pipe being installed, but shall not
be less than six inches thick under any circumstances. They shall extend from
the fitting to the undisturbed wall of the excavation. The contractor shall
ensure that the concrete does not cover or render inoperable nuts or bolts on
the fittings. All metal fittings, valves, or appurtenances shall be wrapped in
polyethylene prior to pouring thrust blocks.
         (c)   Concrete thrust blocks shall be allowed to cure for 48 hours
prior to activating the water main. If the water main needs to be activated
prior to the concrete curing, then the water main shall be restrained using
joint restraining devices. Prior to backfilling, thrust blocks shall cure for a
minimum of four hours.
         (d)   Thrust blocks shall be installed as shown on the drawings and
shall meet or exceed the minimum volume or bearing area requirements as
specified on the drawings or specifications for the water pressures and soil
conditions.
         (e)   In muck, peat, or similar weak soils, thrust loads shall be
resisted by using joint restraining devices or by removal of the soil and
replacement with a material of sufficient stability to resist thrust loads as
determined by the engineer.
         (f)   Where prior approval of the engineer is obtained, the contractor
may substitute acceptable joint restraining devices for concrete thrust
blocking.
      (10)   Joint restraining device installations. Joint restraining devices
are required for the following installations.
         (a)   All valves 12 inches and larger, and pipe joints within their
corresponding L lengths shall be restrained;
         (b)   All high pressure valves (working pressures greater than 110
psi) and pipe joints within their corresponding L lengths shall be restrained;
         (c)   Valves ten inches and smaller placed on dead end mains with less
than 71 feet of pipe downstream of the valve shall be restrained using the
appropriate joint restraining devices for a dead end. Both the upstream and
downstream pipe joints within their corresponding L lengths shall be
restrained;
         (d)   All reducers/increasers and their corresponding L lengths shall
be restrained;
         (e)   All vertical bends and pipe joints within their corresponding L
lengths shall be restrained;
         (f)   All water main lowering and pipe joints shall be restrained.
Water main lowering restraint shall include restraining all joints within the
filling’s corresponding L length, plus restraining all pipe joints which lie
between the start of the lowering and the end of the lowering, regardless
whether or not the pipe joint is located within the fitting’s L length;
         (g)   All joint restraint devices shall be double poly wrapped and
taped per city specifications for polyethylene encasement. If cathodic
protection anodes are used, double poly wrap shall not be required. The
polyethylene encasement ends shall be taped around the entire pipe diameter;
         (h)   Joint restraining devices shall be installed per the
manufacturer’s recommendations and for the appropriate water pressures and soil
conditions as shown on the drawings or specifications.
      (11)   Tracer wire. Tracer wire shall be installed along with all water
pipes as described below.
         (a)   The tracer wire shall be extended along with the water main. The
wire shall be installed along the top of the pipe and shall be securely
anchored to the pipe every four feet horizontally with an adhesive tape. The
tracer wire shall be extended along all water main branches and hydrant leads
as well. At fire hydrant leads, two tracer wires (the upstream tracer wire and
the downstream tracer wire) shall be brought along the lead and brought to the
surface at the fire hydrant. The upstream and downstream tracer wire at fire
hydrants shall not be tied together, as this is intended to allow independent
tracing of the downstream and upstream main.
         (b)   Tracer wire shall not be installed with copper water service
lines.
         (c)   Tracer wire shall be installed with PVC water services. Tracer
wire installed with PVC service lines shall be installed in accordance with
water main requirements except that the tracer wire shall be brought to the
surface at a service line valve location. Do not connect the water service
tracer wire to the tracer wire on the main. Tracer wire installed along service
lines shall be independent of the tracer wire installed along the main. This
allows for only tracing the service line.
         (d)   At locations where the PVC water service is not being replaced
entirely, the contractor shall splice the new tracer wire to the existing
tracer wire at the point of re-connection. In instances where a PVC water
service is not being replaced entirely and an existing tracer wire is not
encountered, the contractor shall coil approximately five feet of wire at the
re-connection location(s) to facilitate a future splice.
         (e)   All tracer wire connections shall be accomplished through the
use of pig-tails. All splices and pig-tails shall be accomplished by stripping
the wires to be connected, twisting the wires together, securing the connection
by using an appropriately sized wire nut, and then preserving the splice or
pig-tail wire nut with silicone.
         (f)   The main line tracer wire shall run continuous along the main(s)
from fire hydrant auxiliary valves to fire hydrant auxiliary valve but shall
not be continuous at fire hydrant auxiliary valves. At fire hydrant auxiliary
valves, two tracer wires shall be installed. One wire is the main line wire
from downstream of the fire hydrant, and the second wire is the main line wire
going upstream of the fire hydrant. The tracer wire shall be extended at least
three feet above the auxiliary valve, the wires folded, connected with wire
nuts, wire nuts made waterproof with silicone and inserted into the auxiliary
valve box for storage. The wire shall be easily retrievable for connection to
and subsequent testing. The main line tracer wire shall not be interconnected
at the fire hydrant auxiliary valve or at the main. This is intended to allow
independent tracing of the downstream main from the upstream main and vice
versa. Service line tracer wire shall not be connected to the main line tracer
wire.
         (g)   The Public Works Department shall be able to successfully
electronically trace all newly installed tracer wire/water mains. Personnel
should be able to connect to tracing wires at every fire hydrant auxiliary
valve location and energize all water mains between that fire hydrant auxiliary
valve and the surrounding fire hydrants auxiliary valve. The contractor is
responsible for coordinating conductivity testing with public works personnel
prior to finish surfacing activities. If the tracer wire does not function as
intended, the contractor shall repair the system to the satisfaction of the
engineer.
         (h)   The Public Works Department shall inspect all underground
splices and pig tails prior to backfilling.
      (12)   Insulation. Insulation shall be placed where noted on the plans.
Insulation board shall be placed on a smooth and level cushion, minimum of two
inches, of fine concrete aggregate (sand) and shall be covered with a minimum
of two inches of the same material before placing bedding or backfill material
on the insulation. The build-up of insulation sheeting shall be done by
staggering the joints. An acceptable adhesive may be used to retain the
individual sheets in the final specified dimensions.
      (13)   Fire hydrants and auxiliary valves.
         (a)   Fire hydrants shall stand plumb and shall have their nozzles
parallel with or at right angles to the street, with the pumper nozzle facing
the street. At intersections, the pumper nozzle shall face the higher
classification street. Hydrants shall be set with the bottom of the breaker
flange two inches above the finished ground elevation as shown on the standard
details, resulting in the centerline of the lowest nozzle being at least 18
inches above finished grade. In no case shall hydrants be set closer than four
feet from curb or edge of pavement, measured from outside of hydrant barrel to
back of curb or edge of pavement.
         (b)   The contractor shall set each fire hydrant on an eight inch by
12 inch precast concrete pad with a four inch thickness and shall place a
minimum of one-third cubic yards of Type 2 Foundation Material around the lower
part of the hydrant to at least six inches above the drain port to provide a
drainage area for the hydrant barrel. The contractor shall ensure that the
drain port at the base of the hydrant is open to allow for the hydrant to drain
properly when closed. Cast in place concrete may be used in lieu of the pre-
cast pad if the hydrant lead is not charged for at least 48 hours and the
drainage ports are maintained.
         (c)   The hydrant barrel shall be poly wrapped to the ground surface
and the poly wrap shall not cover up the weep holes.
         (d)   An appropriately sized thrust block shall be installed between
the hydrant valve chamber and the undisturbed trench wall. The thrust block
shall meet the thrust block specifications herein.
         (e)   An auxiliary valve matching the size of the fire hydrant lead
and a valve box shall be installed on the fire hydrant lead. Auxiliary valves
shall be installed as detailed on the standard plate and shall be placed on a
precast concrete block, or shall be fitted with a joint restraining device as
approved by the engineer. Cast in place concrete may be used in lieu of the
pre-cast pad if the hydrant and hydrant lead are not charged for 48 hours, and
four hours cure time is allowed before backfilling. If the auxiliary valve
needs to be moved away from the fire hydrant to avoid a conflict, it may be
moved up to five feet away from the hydrant.
         (f)   Tracer wire conduit shall be attached to the fire hydrant
auxiliary valve prior to backfill. Refer to subdivision (11) above for tracer
wire installation requirements.
         (g)   Fire hydrant lead shall mean that portion of the hydrant branch
line from the main to the auxiliary valve.
      (14)   Valves.
         (a)   Valve interiors and adjacent piping shall be cleaned of foreign
material prior to making valve to pipe connection. Pipe/valve joints shall be
straight and without deflection. All valves shall be encased in polyethylene
per AWWA standard C105 and as specified herein, and shall be placed on a
precast concrete anchor block and centered on the valve. Valves shall be
backfilled with Type 1 bedding material to one foot above the valve. The
contractor shall check all operating mechanisms for proper functioning. Valves
which do not operate easily or are otherwise defective shall be replaced at the
contractor’s expense.
         (b)   Valves placed on dead-ends of mains with less than the required
L length of pipe extending beyond the valve shall be restrained using the
appropriate joint restraining devices.
         (c)   All valves which are not epoxy coated shall be poly wrapped.
      (15)   Valve boxes.
         (a)   Valve boxes shall be installed straight and plumb directly over
the valve stem and shall not be placed in direct contact with the valve. The
top of the valve box shall be placed flush to one-fourth inches below flush
with the surfacing in paved or graveled areas and one to two inches above
finished grade in grass surfaced areas. Where the drawings indicate that the
future grade at the valve location will be higher or lower than the existing
grade at the time of valve installation, the contractor shall provide the
correct combination of extension pieces so that the valve box can be adjusted
to the future finished grade without replacing the valve box.
         (b)   A valve box adaptor shall be installed on the valve bonnet prior
to installing the valve box.
         (c)   Tracer wire shall be secured to the valve box section prior to
backfill.
      (16)   Tapping tees for taps four inches and larger.
         (a)   Where new four inch or larger service lines or mains are to be
connected to a main, the contractor shall furnish all material necessary for
connection to the water main, as specified herein. The tapping tee shall be
assembled in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Tapping sleeves
shall be supported independently from the pipe prior to tapping and shall be
provided with thrust restraint as specified for other fittings. All tapping
tees which are not epoxy coated or non-corrosive material shall be poly
wrapped.
         (b)   The Public Works Department will coordinate all taps, and the
contractor shall schedule all taps between 7:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. Monday
through Friday, or as alternately scheduled by the Public Works Department.
         (c)   The contractor shall obtain and pay for all applicable permits
and tapping fees.
      (17)   Polyethylene fitting encasement. All fittings and accessories,
which are not epoxy coated or made of non-corrosive material, shall be encased
in eight millimeter thickness sheet polyethylene per AWWA standard C105. The
polyethylene sheet shall be installed per AWWA C105 and taped. The polyethylene
shall fully encase the fitting and appurtenances. Excess material shall be
neatly trimmed away and all seams shall be tapped. The transition between the
polyethylene sheet and PVC pipe or the DI poly tube shall be accomplished by
sealing the ends of the sheet and taping the material fully around the
circumference of the pipe. Cost of the encasement shall be incidental to the
bid price of the fitting.
   (F)   Disinfection.
      (1)   General. Disinfection shall comply with the requirements of AWWA
standards C651, C605, and C600. All new water mains and appurtenances shall be
disinfected before they are placed in service. All water mains taken out of
service for inspecting, repairing, or other activity that might lead to
contamination shall be disinfected before they are returned to service.
      (2)   Preventative methods.
         (a)   The tablet method specified below may be used only if the pipes
and appurtenances are kept clean and dry during construction. Therefore, the
contractor shall take precautions to protect the interiors of pipes, fittings,
and valves against contamination. Pipe delivered for construction shall be
strung so as to minimize the entrance of foreign material.
         (b)   If dirt enters the pipe, it shall be removed and the interior of
the pipe surface swabbed with a 1-5% hypochlorite disinfecting solution. If, in
the opinion of the engineer, the dirt remaining in the pipe will not be removed
by flushing, the contractor shall clean the interior of the pipe by mechanical
means, such as a hydraulically propelled foam pig. Following mechanical
cleaning the contractor shall flush the line achieving minimum flushing
velocities of at least 30 feet per second, and shall then disinfect the pipe
using either the continuous feed or the slug method. Flushing a completed main
will not be allowed as a method of cleaning sediment allowed to enter the pipe
during construction.
         (c)   All openings in the pipeline shall be closed with watertight
plugs when pipe laying is stopped at the close of the day’s work or for other
reasons, such as rest breaks or meal periods. If water accumulates in the
trench, the plugs shall remain in place until the trench is dry. If, for any
reason, the water main is flooded during construction, it shall be cleared of
the floodwater by draining and flushing with potable water until the main is
clean. The section exposed to floodwater shall then be filled with a
chlorinated potable water that, at the end of a 24 hour holding period, will
have a free chlorine residual of not less than 25 milligrams per liter. The
chlorinated water shall then be flushed from the main and after construction is
completed, the main shall be disinfected using the continuous feed or slug
method.
      (3)   Disinfectant.
         (a)   Unless specified otherwise in the detailed specifications or on
the drawings, or required by other provisions of this specification,
disinfection shall be accomplished by the tablet method. The contractor shall
obtain the engineer’s approval prior to using a method other than the tablet
method.
         (b)   This method requires that the pipes and appurtenances be kept
clean and dry. This method may not be used if the pipes and appurtenances are
not kept clean and dry. In the event this happens, the engineer must be
contacted.
         (c)   Tablets shall be five gram calcium hypochlorite tablets
conforming to AWWA standard B300 and shall contain between 65-70% available
chlorine. Tablets shall be fresh and shall be stored in a cool, dry, and dark
environment to prevent loss of strength, which occurs upon exposure to the
atmosphere.
         (d)   Do not use calcium hypochlorite intended for swimming pool
disinfection, as this material has been sequestered and is extremely difficult
to eliminate from the pipe after the desired contact time has been achieved.
      (4)   Dosage. Unless otherwise specified, the contractor shall place
hypochlorite tablets in each section of water pipe installed, including the
hydrant branch, according to the table below.
Number of five gram calcium hypochlorite tablets required
Length of pipe section (feet) Diameter of pipe (inches)
Number of five gram calcium hypochlorite tablets required

1 For pipes 18 inches and larger, refer to drawings or detailed
specifications for disinfection requirements.
 
      (5)   Placing tablets. Tablets shall be adhered to the inside top section
of each pipe length using a food-grade adhesive, such as Permatex Form-a-Gasket
No. 2 or Loctite Corporation Permatex Clear RTV Silicone Adhesive Sealant.
There shall be no adhesive on the tablet except on the broad side attached to
the surface of the pipe. If the tablets are attached before the pipe section is
placed in the trench, their position shall be marked on the pipe section to
indicate the pipe has been installed with the tablets at the top.
      (6)   Filling and contact. The water main shall be filled slowly so that
the water velocity is no greater than one foot per second. Precautions shall be
taken to assure that air pockets are eliminated. The water shall be allowed to
stand in the pipe for at least 24 hours. Valves shall be positioned so that the
strong chlorine solution in the treated main will not flow into water mains in
active service. The chlorinated water shall remain in the pipe for at least 24
hours. The contractor shall notify the engineer at the end of the 24 hour
retention period prior to flushing to allow the engineer to check the chlorine
residual in the pipe. If the chlorine residual is less than 25 milligrams per
liter, the contractor shall, at his or her expense, disinfect the water main
again by the continuous feed method or the slug method, as approved by the
engineer.
      (7)   Flushing.
         (a)   Within 48 hours of the end of the 24 hour retention period, the
contractor shall flush the heavily-chlorinated water from the main until the
chlorine concentration in the water leaving the main is no higher than that
prevailing in the system or is less than one ppm as determined by the engineer.
In addition to the above requirements, a minimum flushing velocity of three
feet per second and flushing duration of one minute per 100 feet of pipe being
flushed shall be achieved per the table below.
         (b)   Flushing shall be done in accordance with AWWA C651. Flushing
shall be accomplished through use of hydrants or temporary fittings installed
for the purpose. Flushing through corporations and/or water service lines is
prohibited. The contractor shall obtain the engineer’s approval prior to
installing special fittings for flushing.
         (c)   Flushing shall be conducted in such a way as to prevent
contamination of existing water mains and/or water service lines and to
minimize traffic and pedestrian hazards and nuisance conditions. When possible,
flushing shall be to the nearest storm sewer or drainage way. Flushing to the
sanitary sewer is prohibited.
         (d)   The contractor will be responsible for any damage to fish and/or
aquatic life caused by the chlorine residual. If chlorine reaches or is
detected in a stream, river, or other waterway the contractor will be in
violation for that discharge.
         (e)   A velocity in the main of at least three feet per second shall
be attained during flushing. The flushing shall proceed until the chlorine
concentration in the water leaving the main is no higher than that prevailing
in the system, or is less than one ppm as determined by the engineer. The table
below shows the rates of flow required to produce a velocity of three feet per
second in pipes of various sizes, and the minimum flushing duration per 100
feet of pipe length. In no case shall the flushing duration be less than that
indicated in the table below.

1 For pipes 18 inches and larger, refer to drawings or detailed specifications
for flushing requirements
2 Requires a minimum 40 psi pressure in the main and the hydrant flowing to
atmosphere
3 Assumes that the corresponding flow rate is being met
 
         (f)   Per AWWA C651, the contractor shall sample for coliform bacteria
contamination. After the water lines have been flushed, the contractor shall
sample the lines. Two consecutive samples of water from the end of the
disinfected/flushed line must be collected at least 24 hours apart. These
samples must be submitted to the state health laboratory, or other laboratory
acceptable to the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the
engineer. The samples must show the absence of coliform bacteria contamination
before any taps may be made to the main or the main is activated and placed
into service. Copies of all sample results shall be submitted to the engineer
within 48 hours of receipt thereof.
         (g)   Because of the high risk of contamination during sampling, the
contractor shall use certified lab personnel or a trained sampler to collect
all samples submitted for testing.
      (8)   Disposal of chlorinated water. When, in the opinion of the engineer
or contractor, the potential exists for chlorinated water to reach a stream,
river, or waterway, the contractor shall apply a neutralizing chemical to the
water to be wasted to neutralize thoroughly the chlorine residual remaining in
the water as listed in appendix B of AWWA standard C651. The contractor will be
responsible for any damage to fish and/or aquatic life caused by the chlorine
residual. If chlorine reaches or is detected in a stream, river, or other
waterway the contractor will be in violation for that discharge.
   (G)   Pressure and leakage test for mains and service lines four inches or
larger.
      (1)   General. Pressure and leakage tests shall be performed on all newly
installed water mains. The simultaneous pressure and leakage tests will be used
unless otherwise specified. The testing methods specified in this division are
specific for water pressure testing only. Air pressure testing is prohibited
due to the catastrophic nature of failure should failure occur.
      (2)   Test restrictions.
         (a)   The pressure shall be 150% of the working pressure at the point
of test, but not less than 125% of normal working pressure at the highest
elevation, whichever is greater. Test pressure shall not exceed pipe, valve, or
thrust restraint design pressures, and shall not vary by more than five psi
(plus or minus) for the duration of the test. The duration of the hydrostatic
test shall be a minimum of two hours.
         (b)   The contractor shall anticipate the need to conduct multiple
tests in areas of varying topography and shall conduct testing in such a manner
and sequence that the pressure requirements indicated above are achieved.
      (3)   Pressurization. Before applying the specified test pressure, each
valved section of pipe to be tested shall be slowly filled with potable water
and all air expelled from the pipe, valves, fittings, and hydrants. Where town
water is not available, the contractor shall furnish sufficient potable water
to fill and test the pipe. The specified test pressure, based on the elevation
of the lowest point of the section under test and corrected to the elevation of
the test gauge, shall then be applied by means of a suitable pump connected to
the pipe in a manner satisfactory to the engineer and shall be sustained for
the specified time. The test pump shall be equipped with two accurate pressure
gauges, between the pump shut-off valve and water main being tested, both to
show the line pressure reading during testing. When hydrants are in the test
section, the test shall be made against closed hydrant valves.
      (4)   Leakage shall be defined as the quantity of water that must be
supplied into the newly laid pipe or any valved section thereof to maintain
pressure within five psi of the specified test pressure after the pipe has been
filled with water and the air has been expelled. Leakage shall not be measured
by the drop in pressure for a test section over a period of time.
      (5)   Allowable leakage for PVC pipe. The PVC pipe shall be pressure and
leakage tested in accordance with AWWA C605. No pipe installation will be
accepted if the leakage is greater than that indicated in the table below.

      (6)   (a)   Acceptance shall be determined on the basis of allowable
leakage. If any test of installed pipe discloses leakage greater than that
specified in the table above, the contractor shall, at his or her own expense,
locate and make approved repairs as necessary until the leakage is within the
specified allowance. All visible leaks shall be repaired, regardless of the
amount of leakage.
         (b)   Any damaged or defective pipe, fittings, valves, hydrants, or
joints discovered following the pressure test shall be repaired or replaced
with approved material at the contractor’s expense, and the test shall be
repeated until it is within the specified allowance.
   (H)   Pressure and leakage test for service lines less than four inches.
Pressure and leakage tests shall be performed on all newly installed copper
water service lines if the service line has one or more couplings installed
between the corporation and the curb stop, and/or one or more couplings
installed between the curb stop and the property water distributing system. The
testing method shall be as specified in the National Standard Plumbing Code
with the exception that air pressure testing is prohibited.
   (I)   Water main closures and temporary service.
      (1)   Water main closures shall be scheduled to minimize the
inconvenience to the public. Consequently, water main closures shall be
scheduled between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, when possible.
Water main closures scheduled to begin prior to or continue beyond those times
listed above will require approval from the engineer. In any case, water main
closures will not be allowed until the engineer gives his or her approval.
      (2)   The contractor shall notify the Public Works Department of all
proposed closures at least 48 hours prior to closure of any water main, unless
a shorter time of notice is approved by the engineer. The Public Works
Department will issue closure notification to affected landowners.
      (3)   Operation of valves. Only public works personnel shall operate
valves on existing water mains. The contractor may operate valves on newly
installed water mains that are under his or her control, until such time as
they are accepted by the city for operation and maintenance.
      (4)   Temporary water service for private residences affected shall be
provided by the contractor when the water main closure will exceed eight hours.
The contractor shall provide temporary water service for businesses upon
request, regardless of the length of closure. When temporary service is to be
provided to businesses, the contractor shall obtain the name and phone number
of a responsible contact person at each affected business and submit the
information to the engineer at least 48 hours prior to closure.
   (J)   Abandonment and/or salvage of water main and appurtenances.
      (1)   Water mains. The contractor shall seal all open ends of water mains
to be abandoned with a concrete plug having a length equal to the diameter of
the pipe being plugged.
      (2)   Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants and auxiliary valves are to be removed
and salvaged, unless indicated otherwise on the drawings or detailed
specifications, and shall be delivered by the contractor to the Public Works
Department in good working condition. Any damage to the hydrant and/or
appurtenances as a result of removing, salvaging, and delivering, shall be
repaired by the contractor at no cost to the city.
      (3)   Valves. Unless indicated otherwise on the drawings or detailed
specifications, valves are to be removed, salvaged, and delivered by the
contractor to the Public Works Department in good working condition. Any damage
to the valve as a result of removing, salvaging, and delivering, shall be
repaired by the contractor at no cost to the town.
      (4)   Valve boxes. The contractor shall close the valve, remove and
salvage the top sections of those water main valve boxes marked on the plans to
be abandoned and shall deliver them to the Public Works Department. The
resulting holes shall be backfilled and compacted to meet the requirements of
these specifications and shall be resurfaced with the appropriate material:
i.e. seed, sod, asphalt, concrete, etc.
      (5)   Others. When the drawings indicate items are to be removed or
salvaged, the contractor shall deliver the items to the Public Works Department
in good working condition. Any damage to the items as a result of removing,

§ 92.01 PURPOSE.
   To improve, protect and preserve the appearance, character, value and safety
of the town’s urban area and nearby properties. In addition to improving and
preserving landscaping during development, there are reasons for both the use
of landscaping and buffers.
   (A)   Screening between incompatible adjacent land uses. Zoning was once
built on a strict separation of land uses. Today, that is no longer the case.
Greater freedom in the use of property and privacy for the landowner can be had
through buffering between land uses with vegetation, land forms or distance.
   (B)   Erosion control and water pollution. Trees and plants reduce erosion
by binding soil particles with their roots and holding the soil together
against the effects of wind and water. When development occurs and impervious
surfaces are created, for example, asphalt, concrete, the flow of water across
exposed soils can greatly increase, causing serious water pollution problems.
Vegetation can slow the runoff by acting as a sponge, gradually releasing snow
or rain. This results in an improvement of water quality and reduces the need
for engineered drainage solutions.
   (C)   Modification of the climate in the immediate vicinity. Landscaping as
well as other forms of land form such as berms can improve air quality and
moderate daily temperature by absorbing pollution, providing shade and offering
protection from the wind. In addition, trees, grass, leaves, shrubs, even twigs
and branches, can absorb and disperse sound energy, reducing overall noise
levels.
   (D)   Aesthetics. Often without the softening effect of trees and shrubs,
the modern day built environment appears harsh and uninviting.
(Ord. 10.10, passed 5-19-2009)
§ 92.02 HOW TO USE THIS CHAPTER.
   This chapter has five basic parts:
   (A)   Part I: applicability of landscaping/buffer standards and terms (§§
92.03 through
92.05): explains applicability of standards, sets forth exceptions and
alternate forms of compliance process and defines terms;
   (B)   Part II: buffers; composition and when required (§
92.06): the composition of each buffer is explained and information of
buffering between land uses and/or zones that share common property lines is
presented;
   (C)   Part III: landscaping requirements for nonresidential uses (§§
92.07 through
92.11): explains parking lot requirements (both interior and perimeter) and
general landscaping requirements;
   (D)   Part IV: landscape plans (§§
92.12 and
92.13): explains the elements of a landscape plan and the alternatives when
landscaping is not immediately practical; and
   (E)   Part V: plant suggestions and approved fencing standards (§§
92.14 and
92.15).
(Ord. 10.10, passed 5-19-2009)
§ 92.03 APPLICATION.
   (A)   Landscaping requirements may apply to developing uses and are a
condition of building permit approval. A buffer requirement may also apply to a
developing project if it shares a common boundary line with a different zoning
district or it has a significantly different use.
   (B)   In the event both buffer and landscaping requirements apply in the
same physical location, the buffer requirement is the one requiring compliance.
(Ord. 10.10, passed 5-19-2009)
§ 92.04 EXCEPTIONS AND ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   Ongoing development projects. Developments granted a building permit
prior to the date of the adoption of this chapter are exempt from the
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Where physical features preclude strict compliance. It is recognized
that, on occasion, complete compliance with the terms of this chapter may be
impractical.
      (1)   Accordingly, a developer may request approval for an alternate
landscaping scheme when any one or combination of the below listed conditions
exist:
         (a)   The site involves space limitations or unusually shaped parcels;
         (b)   Topography, soil, vegetation or other site conditions are such
that full compliance is impossible or impractical;
         (c)   Natural vegetation on the site, if undisturbed during the
development process, can meet or exceed the vegetation which is required; and/
or
         (d)   Safety considerations are involved.
      (2)   In order to have landscape requirements modified due to one or a
combination of the above, the applicant should submit a written justification
to the Planning and Zoning Board. Within the justification, the applicant must
describe:
         (a)   Which of the landscape requirements will be met with
modifications;
         (b)   Which of the conditions set forth above justify using
alternatives; and
         (c)   How the proposed alternative meets or exceeds what is required.
(Ord. 10.10, passed 5-19-2009)
§ 92.05 TERMS.
   There are several important key concepts to understand. For the purpose of
this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BERM. An earthen mound designed to provide visual interest, screen
undesirable views and/or decrease noise.
   BUFFER. Thought of as a “transitional space”, a buffer can consist of
horizontal space (land) and vertical elements (plants, berms, fences or walls).
Its purpose is to physically separate and visually screen adjacent land uses
that are not fully compatible.
   CALIPER. A measurement of the diameter of a tree trunk.
   DECIDUOUS. Plants/trees which lose their leaves in the fall.
   DEVELOPING USE. This is the use being considered for development. The use
may be straight permitted, or conditional. It is typically this use which will
require the filing of a site plan (a plan for development) and it is usually
this developer who will be responsible for buffering his or her use from an
existing adjacent use.
   EVERGREEN. Plants/trees which retain foliage throughout the year.
   EXISTING ADJACENT USE. The use of land already in place prior to the
development of an adjacent land use.
   PLANTING STRIP OR AREA. A ground surface free of concrete, asphalt, stone,
gravel, brick or other paving materials, aside from walkways, which is required
or used for landscaping purposes.
   SHRUB. A woody plant, smaller than a tree, consisting of several small stems
from the ground or small branches near the ground. SHRUB may be deciduous or
evergreen.
   TREE, CANOPY OR LARGE MATURING TREE. Any tree the height of which exceeds 35
feet at maturity.
   TREE, UNDERSTORY OR SMALL MATURING TREE. Any tree the height of which is
less than 35 feet at maturity.
(Ord. 10.10, passed 5-19-2009)
§ 92.06 BUFFERS; COMPOSITION AND WHEN REQUIRED.
   Certain land uses, because of their character and intensity, may create an
adverse impact on less intensive and varied adjacent land uses. Accordingly,
the following regulations are established to protect and preserve the
appearance, character and value of property throughout the town.
   (A)   When buffers are required.
      (1)   New uses. Buffers are required when certain land uses develop and
share a common property line with either a significantly different type of use
in the same zone or, in some cases, a differing zone.
      (2)   Expansion of an existing use falling into any of the categories
listed above. The expansion of an existing use can have an adverse impact on
adjoining properties. When an expansion is less than 5% of the building floor
area or 1,000 square feet, whichever is lesser, buffers are not required.
Additionally, the entirety of the existing use need not be buffered. Buffers
are required instead as follows.
         (a)   Expansion of a structure or parking facility.
            1.   Only the area undergoing expansion must comply with the buffer
requirements. The buffer should encompass the area along the side and/or rear
lot line where construction activity occurs, 90 degrees from the beginning and
ending points of construction.
            2.   When parking or accessory buildings bar the development of a
full buffer, they need not be removed to facilitate full compliance.
         (b)   Addition of buildings to a lot. Any new building or parking lot
(s) added to an already developed lot are required to meet the buffer
requirements; the prior development is not.
   (B)   Responsibility for developing. The developing land use is completely
responsible for the creation of the buffer yard with the following
modification.
   (C)   Exceptions/modifications.
      (1)   When an abutting parcel contains a natural vegetative strip
comparable to a buffer yard, this area may count toward the requirement of the
buffer yard.
      (2)   When a required buffer abuts a public alley, up to one-half of the
alley width can be used to satisfy the buffer width requirement of these
regulations.
      (3)   The width of a required buffer may be reduced by 25% if a wall,
fence or berm is provided that meets the following standards.
         (a)   The fence or wall is constructed in a durable fashion of brick,
stone, other masonry materials or wood posts and planks or any combination of
the aforesaid materials. No more than 25% of a fence surface may be left open,
open work being distributed equally over the entirety of the fence, and the
finished side of the fence faces the abutting property.
         (b)   Walls and fences must be a minimum height of six feet.
         (c)   Berms must be a minimum height of four feet with a maximum slope
of three to one and those exceeding six feet in height must have a maximum
slope of four to one. Additionally, they must be stabilized to prevent erosion
and landscaped.
         (d)   Shrubs may be waived if a fence or wall is built. If a berm is
constructed, shrubs are still required but may be reduced by 25%.
      (4)   Buffer requirements may be waived when their requirement would
result in buffering between fundamentally compatible land uses, for example,
when a use has been allowed “permitted by standards”. Accordingly, the Planning
and Zoning Board is authorized to waive buffer levels if and only if their
requirement would serve no purpose. The waiver must be written and dated on the
face of the zoning compliance permit of the developing use.
   (D)   Specific requirements for trees and shrubs placed in the buffer. For
trees and shrubs best suited for the area the books South Dakota Trees and
South Dakota Shrubs are available in the town office.
      (1)   Trees: at least 40% of required trees within a buffer must be large
maturing trees with a minimum caliper of two and one-half inches measured six
inches above ground at the time of planting; small maturing trees must have a
minimum caliper of one and one-half inches measured six inches. Twenty-five
percent of the trees in the buffer must be evergreen.
      (2)   Shrubs must be evergreen and at least two and one-half feet tall
when planted with an average height of five to six feet expected as normal
growth over a four-year period. Twenty-five percent of shrubs may vary from the
above as follows:
         (a)   May be deciduous;
         (b)   May be two feet tall when planted provided three to four feet
growth is anticipated over a four-year period; and
         (c)   If planted on a berm may be of a lesser height provided that
combined height of the berm and plantings is at least six feet after four
years.
   (E)   Miscellaneous provisions.
      (1)   All trees and shrubs are to be planted in both a visually pleasing
fashion and in a way so as to facilitate the creation of a visual screen.
Generally, plantings should be spaced equidistant throughout the buffer with
final design approval part of the overall site plan approval.
      (2)   A minimum of two types of trees and shrubs must be used to minimize
the effects of disease and/or blight.
(Ord. 10.10, passed 5-19-2009)
§ 92.07 PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Applicability. All parking areas in excess of 40 spaces for all uses
except parking areas for single-family or two-family dwellings.
   (B)   Types of landscaping required. Two types are required within each
parking area as follows:
      (1)   Perimeter landscaping. Parking area perimeters which are adjacent
either to public rights-of-way or residentially used property must landscape
perimeters with minimum eight-foot wide strips of landscaping. Both trees and
shrubs are required via the following formula:
         (a)   Trees: required at the rate of one canopy tree for every 200
square feet of required planting area or one understory tree for every 150
square feet; and
         (b)   Shrubs: shrubs are required in addition to trees and at a rate
of one per every 50 square feet of planting area.
      (2)   Interior landscaping. Landscaping within the interior of parking
areas is important for aesthetics and also functional in that landscaping
moderates heat, glare, wind and other climatic effects produced by paved areas.
Accordingly, interior parking area space is to be landscaped as follows:
         (a)   Trees: required at a rate of one per 16 parking spaces. At least
40% of required trees must be large maturing trees with a minimum caliper of
two and one-half inches measured six inches above ground at the time of
planting; small maturing trees must have a minimum caliper of one and one- half
inches measured six inches. Twenty-five percent of the trees throughout the
parking lot must be evergreen.
         (b)   Shrubs: required at a rate of three per 16 spaces. Must be
evergreen and at least two and one-half feet tall when planted with an average
height of five to six feet expected as normal growth over a four-year period.
Twenty-five percent of shrubs may vary from the above as follows:
            1.   May be deciduous or evergreen; and
            2.   May be two feet tall when planted provided three to four feet
growth is anticipated over a four-year period.
(Ord. 10.10, passed 5-19-2009)
§ 92.08 PLACEMENT OF LANDSCAPING THROUGHOUT THE PARKING AREA.
   (A)   Trees and shrubs must be placed throughout the parking area to
decrease the appearance of a single expanse of pavement and provide shade.
   (B)   Alternatives include:
      (1)   A continuous landscape strip between every four rows of parking. A
minimum of nine feet in width should be adequate to accommodate both shrubbery
and trees;
      (2)   Large planting islands (over 600 square feet) located throughout
the lot and planted with shade trees, low shrubs and/or ground cover. They
should preferably be located at the ends of parking rows; or
      (3)   Planting islands between every ten to 16 spaces to avoid long rows
of parked cars.
   (C)   The size should be a minimum of nine feet wide to allow for an
adequate planting area.
   (D)   Each planting island should provide at least one large, maturing/
canopy tree.
   (E)   In general, all trees and shrubs are to be placed in a visually
pleasing fashion.
   (F)   Additionally, it is also strongly recommended that a variety of both
trees and shrubs be used when possible to preclude disease or blight from
eliminating all of each.
(Ord. 10.10, passed 5-19-2009)
§ 92.09 GENERAL SITE LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Applicability. All commercial and industrial uses.
   (B)   General requirements.
      (1)   Minimum landscaped area. Each site must develop a planting strip
with a minimum ten foot width along all areas which front public rights-of-way.
      (2)   Ratio of trees and shrubs to square footage.
         (a)   Trees: required at the rate of one canopy tree for every 200
square feet of required planting area or one understory tree for every 150
square feet.
         (b)   Shrubs: shrubs are required in addition to trees and at a rate
of one per every 50 square feet of planting area.
(Ord. 10.10, passed 5-19-2009)
§ 92.10 VISIBILITY.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as permitting any obstruction to
view which could constitute a traffic hazard and/or violate the sight triangle
requirements of the town.
(Ord. 10.10, passed 5-19-2009)
§ 92.11 MAINTENANCE OF REQUIRED LANDSCAPING.
   (A)   Responsibility. Required landscaping must be maintained in a healthy,
growing condition at all times. The property owner is responsible for regular
weeding, mowing of grass, irrigating, fertilizing, pruning and other
maintenance of all plantings as needed.
   (B)   Replacement. Plants damaged, diseased or dead must be replaced by the
owner within 60 days of the occurrence of a condition and/or a maintenance
warning notice will be issued by the office of the Town Board. If seasonal
conditions are such that replacement cannot be accomplished immediately, this
requirement can be waived by staff and temporarily delayed.
   (C)   Nonliving materials. Nonliving buffer materials, e.g., fencing, are to
be kept maintained, cleaned and repaired by the owner of the property upon
which they are located.
   (D)   Enforcement of violations. All provisions of this chapter are subject
to the enforcement proceedings.
   (E)   Violation. Registered letter will be sent with notice of 60 days to
correct violation. Noncompliance with the letter will result in a fine in an
amount set by the Board of Trustees, as per the current fee schedule, per month
until requirements are met.
(Ord. 10.10, passed 5-19-2009)
§ 92.12 SUBMISSION OF LANDSCAPE PLANS.
   (A)   Landscape plans must be submitted along with the building permit site
plans and may be superimposed upon the site plan as space permits.
   (B)   Landscape plans are considered to be an integral part of any submitted
site plan and will be subject to the same approval process.
   (C)   The plan shall include:
      (1)   Project information including the total square footage of the
property, the square footage of the building areas, parking and other vehicular
use areas;

for decommissioning that facility and for all costs associated with
decommissioning that facility and associated facilities. The decommissioning
plan shall clearly identify the responsible party.
      (2)   Useful life. A LWES is presumed to be at the end of its useful life
if the facility generates no electricity for a continuous period of 12 months.
The presumption may be rebutted by submitting to the Board for approval of a
plan outlining the steps and schedule for returning the LWES to service within
12 months of the submission.
      (3)   Decommissioning period. The facility owner or operator shall begin
decommissioning a LWES facility within eight months after the time the facility

to the topography and topsoil quality that existed just prior to the beginning
of the construction of the commercial wind energy conversion facility or wind
turbine.
         (c)   Disturbed earth must be graded and reseeded, unless the
landowner requests in writing that the access roads or other land surface areas
be retained.
      (5)   Decommissioning plan. Prior to commencement of operation of a LWES
facility, the facility owner or operator shall file with the Board the
estimated decommissioning cost per turbine, in current dollars at the time of
the application, for the proposed facility and a decommissioning plan that
describes how the facility owner will ensure that resources are available to
pay for decommissioning the facility at the appropriate time. The Board shall
review a plan filed under this section and shall approve or disapprove the plan
within six months after the decommissioning plan was filed. The Board may at
any time require the owner or operator of a LWES to file a report describing
how the LWES owner or operator is fulfilling this obligation.
      (6)   Financial assurance. After the tenth year of operation of a LWES
facility, the Board may require a performance bond, surety bond, letter of
credit, corporate guarantee or other form of financial assurance that is
acceptable to the Board to cover the anticipated costs of decommissioning the
LWES facility.
      (7)   Failure to decommission. If the LWES facility owner or operator
does not complete decommissioning, the Board may take action as may be
necessary to complete decommissioning, including requiring forfeiture of the
bond. The entry into a participating landowner agreement shall constitute
agreement and consent of the parties to the agreement, their respective heirs,
successors and assigns, that the Board may take action as may be necessary to
decommission a LWES facility and seek additional expenditures necessary to do
so from the facility owner.
   (O)   Pre-construction filing.

§ 116.06 REQUIREMENTS FOR ON-SALE FULL-SERVICE RESTAURANT LICENSES.
   (A)   An applicant for an on-sale full-service restaurant license shall
provide documentation to the Finance Officer that the applicant meets all
requirements of state law for an on-sale full-service restaurant license,
including but not limited to: SDCL § 35-4-112. Documentation in support of
initial application for full-service restaurant on-sale license. In the initial
application, an applicant for a full-service restaurant on-sale license shall
provide sufficient documentation to the municipality or county to prove that
the primary source of revenue from the operation of the restaurant will be
derived from the sale of prepared food and nonalcoholic beverages and not from
the sale of alcoholic beverages. The supporting documentation concerning the
primary source of revenue submitted pursuant to this section is confidential.
   (B)   The renewal of an on-sale full-service restaurant license is
conditioned upon the applicant satisfying all state requirements for renewal,
including but not limited to: SDCL § 35-4-113. Renewal of full-service
restaurant on-sale license--Annual report. If the municipality or county is
renewing a full-service restaurant on-sale license, the municipality or county
shall condition the license renewal upon receiving documentation that at least
60% of gross revenue from the preceding 12 months operation of the full-service
restaurant was derived from the sale of food and nonalcoholic beverages. The
full-service restaurant on-sale licensee shall submit an annual report to the
municipality or county on the revenues from the full-service restaurant that
includes an oath verifying the validity of the information provided in the
report. The report and the supporting documentation submitted pursuant to this
section are confidential. The report shall contain the annual gross revenues of
the licensee for the following two categories: (1) food and nonalcoholic
beverage gross revenues; and (2) total gross revenues.
   (C)   Certain licensees to report amount paid for other licenses; objection
to report; hearing; appeal. Any person who purchased an on-sale license issued
pursuant to SDCL §§ 35-4-2(4) or 35-4-2(6) within the last five years shall
report to the town the amount paid for the license. If the town requests from
any other licensee the amount originally paid for any other on-sale license
pursuant to SDCL § 35-4-117, the licensee shall report that amount to the town.
The declared purchase price shall be made under oath and shall include the
documents establishing the amount paid for the on-sale license. If the
transaction included other personal property or real property, the full market
value of the other property on the date of the transaction shall be deducted
from the total purchase price to establish the amount paid for the license. The
person who owned the license as of the date of the adoption of this section has
the burden of establishing the amount paid for the license. If the amount
reported is used to determine current fair market value pursuant to SDCL § 35-
4-117, any licensee who contends that the amount does not accurately reflect
the fair market value of the license on the date of purchase may file an
objection to the report. The objection shall be filed with the town within 30
days of the date the license fee is set pursuant to SDCL § 35-4-116. If an
objection is filed, the Board of Trustees for the town shall conduct a hearing
to determine the fair market value of the license. The determination of the
Board of Trustees for the town may be appealed to circuit court.

being offered and will provide a copy of the registry to anyone who requests a
new on-sale full-service restaurant license.

time initial licensing fee equal to the market value of the license established

residing within the municipality as measured by the last preceding decennial
federal census. (Source SDCL §§ 35-4-19.1, 35-4-111, 35-4-116, and 35-4-117.

exceed those permitted for on-sale licensees.
   (E)   A licensee that is licensed to sell wine on-sale may permit a customer

with a meal that was prepared and served by the licensee at a table on the
licensed premises. The licensee shall securely reseal the bottle of wine with a
cork or other similar cap and place the bottle in a sealed bag or other
container. The licensee shall also attach a receipt for the meal and the wine

determine whether such additional franchise should be granted.
      (4)   Every franchise shall apply to the entire service area of the
grantor, as it exists now or may later be configured.
      (5)    In the event grantor grants one or more additional franchises or

§ 150.04 COMMERCIAL REMODELING.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to establish the requirement that a
permit be issued by the town prior to the commencement of any remodel project
on any commercial structure in excess of 160 square feet. Said permit
application may be made by a general contractor or other person or entity
intending to perform the remodel. Said application must also be signed by the
owner of the property if not the same.
      (2)   The Town Board deems this section to be necessary for the
protection of the health, safety and welfare of its citizens and the general
public by requiring that the remodeling, renovation and construction activity
contemplated herein be subject to the review of qualified inspectors.
   (B)   Permit required. A permit for the remodel of any commercial structure
shall be required if said remodel includes any of the following:
      (1)   Removal, construction or replacement of any interior or exterior
wall, structural support or change to the ingress/egress to the structure;
      (2)   Removal, relocation or addition of all or part of any heating or
ventilation system;
      (3)   Removal, relocation or addition of any electrical wiring or
electrical system components;
      (4)   Removal, addition or relocation of any plumbing;
      (5)   Removal, addition, relocation or installation of any sewer or water
service lines; and
      (6)   Change in the footprint of existing structure.
   (C)   Permit not required. No permit shall be required for any remodeling
which is solely aesthetic in nature, such as, but not limited to, painting,
carpeting, roofing, siding, window replacement or any other improvement
considered general maintenance.
   (D)   Inspection required. Any remodel or renovation for which a state
permit is required, shall be inspected by a town-appointed Building Inspector
or State Plumbing, Electrical, Mechanical Inspector or Structural Inspector as
appointed by the town. The State Fire Marshal shall also inspect any commercial
renovation or remodel requiring a permit under this section.
   (E)   Contractor licensing. In addition to the particular trade license
which may be required by the state, any contractor performing services for
which a permit is required under this section must first apply for and receive
a contractors license from the town. The annual fee for said contractor’s
license shall be $50 per year, renewable every 12 months after date of
issuance, or as may be amended from time to time by the Town Board. Contractor
shall provide to and maintain with the town proof of current liability
insurance coverage.
   (F)   Severability clause. Should any division, sentence, clause or phrase
of this section, for any reason, be held invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such decision shall not offset the validity of the remaining
portions of this section. The town hereby declares that it would have passed
this section and each division, sentence, clause and phrase hereof irrespective
of the possibility that any one or more division, sentence, clause or phrase be
declared unconstitutional or invalid.
   (G)   Certificate of occupancy.
      (1)   A certificate of occupancy may be required, based on the level of
remodel, only after review of any applicable inspectors.
      (2)   The Town Board may require re-certification if warranted under the
Building Code requirements.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 FINDINGS, PURPOSE, METHODS.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. The legislature of the state has in SDCL §§
9-36 and 11-4 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the Board of Trustees
does ordain as follows.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable lo
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
flood-proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in floodplains;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in a manner so as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
      (7)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a
flood area.
   (D)   Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter uses the following methods:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve those uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. 10.03R, passed 11-15-2011)
§ 151.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.  A designated AO, AH or VO zone on a community’s
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a 1% chance or greater annual chance of
flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined
channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where
velocity flow may be evident. The flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet
flow.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year designated as
Zones A, AE, AH, AO, AR, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V on the flood insurance rate
map.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The water surface elevation of the 1% annual
chance flood. The height in relation to mean sea level expected to be reached
by the waters of the base flood at pertinent points in the floodplains of
coastal and riverine areas.
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   BUILDING. See STRUCTURE.
   CRITICAL FEATURE. An integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire
system would be compromised.

A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X and D, to have the top of the elevated
floor, or in the case of a building in Zones VI-30, VE or V, to have the bottom
of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above
the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls
parallel to the floor of the water; and adequately anchored so as not to impair
the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude
of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X and
D, ELEVATED BUILDING also includes a building elevated by means of fill or
solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movement of flood waters.
      (2)   In the case of Zones V1-30, VE or V, ELEVATED BUILDING also
includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of ELEVATED BUILDING, even
though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway
walls met the standards of § 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program
regulations.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION. For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the “start of construction” commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. EXISTING
CONSTRUCTION may also be referred to as EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date
of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of
special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

inundated by water from any source (see definition of FLOODING).
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT. The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to,
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management
regulations.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS. Zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control
ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes the state
or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for
the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
   FLOOD PROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM.  Those physical structural works for which funds
have been authorized, appropriated and expended and which have been constructed
specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas
within a community subject to a “special flood hazard” and the extent of the
depths of associated flooding. This system typically includes hurricane tidal
barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying
works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
   FLOOD WAY (REGULATORY FLOOD WAY). The channel of a river or other
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to
discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation more than a designated height.
   FREEBOARD.  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for purposes of floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for the
many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the
height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as
wave action, bridge openings and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the
watershed.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair

by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual
listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   LEVEE. A human-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control
or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary
flooding.
   LEVEE SYSTEM. A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which
are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building’s LOWEST FLOOR; provided that the
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirement of § 60.3 of the National Flood
Insurance Program regulations.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a “recreational vehicle”.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the
North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community’s flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to the structures. For floodplain management
purposes, NEW CONSTRUCTION means structures for which the “start of
construction” commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to the structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.

temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. No. 97-348)),
includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual START means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before “start of construction” of the
improvement. This includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage”,
regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however,
include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this chapter
when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A VARIANCE,
therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited
by this chapter. (For full requirements, see § 60.6 of the National Flood
Insurance Program regulations.)
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)
(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program
Regulations is presumed to be in violation until a time as that documentation
is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to North American Vertical
Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various
magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
(Ord. 10.03R, passed 11-15-2011; Ord. 10.03R(A1), passed 10-7-2014)
§ 151.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the town.
   (B)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a
scientific and engineering report entitled Flood Insurance Study for Custer
County and Incorporated Areas, dated January 6, 2012, with accompanying flood
insurance rate maps (FIRM) dated January 6, 2012 and any revisions thereto are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
   (C)   Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be
required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered
or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations.
   (E)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions; however, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (F)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (G)   Warning and disclaimer or liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions
greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by human-
made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas
of special flood hazards or uses permitted within the areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.

administration of this chapter.
      (2)   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board
may appeal the decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
      (4)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in division (C) above have been
fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (5)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of
this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach those conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter.
      (6)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (7)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (8)   Prerequisites for granting variances:
         (a)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         (b)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   Showing a good and sufficient cause;
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         (c)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
      (9)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that:
         (a)   The criteria outlined in divisions (D)(1) through (9) of this
section are met; and
         (b)   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.

SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS
§ 155.55 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR USES PERMITTED ON REVIEW.
   In order to accomplish the general purpose of this chapter, it is necessary
to give special consideration to certain uses because they are unique in
nature, require large land areas, are potentially incompatible with existing
development, or because the effects of such uses cannot definitely be foreseen.
The following uses shall be subject to compliance with the regulations in this
section and with the procedure for authorizing uses permitted on review as set
forth in §
155.89.
   (A)   Residential 2 (R2) manufactured home subdivision. The following
property development standards shall apply for all manufactured home
subdivisions and shall be zoned only as Residential 2.
      (1)   No parcel of land containing less than five acres may be used for a
manufactured home subdivision.
      (2)   The manufactured home subdivision shall be subject to the yard,
density, and set back provisions of the district in which it is located.
      (3)   Any manufactured home in the subdivision shall be situated on a
permanent foundation and all elements contributing to its mobility (under-
carriage, wheels, axles, and trailer hitch) shall be removed. All such homes
shall be connected to public water and sewer systems.
      (4)   Any structure in a manufactured home subdivision shall comply with
the yard, height, density, and parking regulations of the zoning district in
which it is located.
      (5)   Low areas subject to any flooding must comply with FEMA
regulations. This shall include anchoring and skirting.

requirements: there shall not be less than 1,500 square feet of lot area for
each space provided in the travel park.
         (c)   The travel parks shall be located on a well-drained site
properly graded to insure rapid drainage and freedom from stagnant pools of
water.
         (d)   Yards adjacent to public streets shall be a minimum of 25 feet
in depth. Yards adjacent to property outside the travel park without an
intervening street or other permanent open space shall be at least 75 feet in
width, provided, however, that this open space requirement may be reduced to a

§ 155.58 YARD, BUILDING SETBACK, AND OPEN SPACE EXCEPTIONS.
   The following requirements are intended to provide exceptions or qualify and
supplement, as the case may be, the specific district regulations set forth in
§§
155.30 through
155.39.
   (A)   The following regulations provide for the maximum safety of persons
using sidewalks and streets, and for the maximum enjoyment of the use of
property.
      (1)   Except in districts allowing the construction of buildings or
structures to the property line, there shall be provided an unobstructed view
across the triangle formed by joining points measured 20 feet along the
property line from the intersection of two streets or 15 feet along both the
street and alley line from the intersection of a street an alley. Within said
triangle there shall be no sight obscuring or partly obscuring walls, fence, or
foliage higher than 30 inches above grade, or in the case of trees, foliage
lower than eight feet. Vertical measurement shall be made at the top of the
curb on the street or alley adjacent to the nearest side of the triangle or if
no curb exists, from the edge of the nearest traveled way. This provision does
not apply to chain link fences, on which no obstructions are attached thereto.
      (2)   In any required front yard, except as provided in division (A)(1)
above, no fence, wall, hedge, or yard ornament shall be permitted which
materially impedes vision across such yard above the height of five feet. This
does not include single ornamental bushes and shrubs.
      (3)   Trimming of trees required - city trimming at owner's expense. The
occupant of any private premises or the owner of the same if not occupied,
abutting on any public street, road, or alley within the town shall keep all
trees standing upon such premises or between the same and the center of the
adjoining street, road or alley so trimmed that no bough or branch thereof
shall be lower than 12 feet above the surface of the street, road, or alley, or
eight feet above the surface of any sidewalk thereon, and shall keep all such
trees trimmed so that no trunk, limb, or branch thereof shall be in any way or
at any time interfere with the movement of delivery, maintenance, garbage
disposal, and emergency service vehicles, or come in contact with any street
lighting, power, or other electrically charged wire when such wires are
lawfully strung on posts located on any public street, road, or alley, or
between the lot lines and curb of any street. Said occupants or owners shall
remove all dead, diseased, or dangerous trees, or broken or decayed limbs,
which constitute a menace to the safety of the public, and shall trim any tree
or shrub which interferes with visibility of any traffic control device or
signs; provided that upon the failure of any occupant or owner to trim such
trees as in this section provided, the Director of Streets and Public Property
of the town shall have the authority to remove them or cause them to be removed
under his or her supervision, whether such trees be growing on privately owned
property or on public property. The Director may cause the same to be trimmed
and the expense charged to the occupant or owner of such property.
   (B)   The purpose here is to clarify certain conditions pertaining to the
use of lots and access points:
      (1)   Dwellings on small lots. Where there are existing recorded lots
which do not meet the minimum lot area requirement and are under separate
ownership, single-family dwellings may be constructed as long as a side yard
shall be not less than four feet and the arm of the side yards shall be not
less than 12 feet, and as long as all other requirements, except lot size, are
met.
      (2)   Principal uses without building. Where a permitted use of land
involves no structures, such use, excluding agricultural uses, shall
nonetheless comply with all yards and minimum lot area requirements applicable
to the district in which located, as well as obtain any other license or permit
applicable to that particular use.
      (3)   No dwelling shall be erected on a lot which does not abut on at
least one street for at least 25 feet. A street shall form the direct and
primary means of ingress and egress for all dwelling units. Alleys, where they
exist, shall form only a secondary means of ingress and egress.

   (C)   Off-street parking lot layout, construction, and maintenance. Wherever
the required off-street parking requires the building of a parking lot, and
wherever a parking lot is built, such parking lot shall be laid out,
constructed, and maintained in accordance with the following regulations.
      (1)   Except for parcels of land devoted to one and two family uses, all
areas devoted to off-street parking shall be so designed and be of such size
that no vehicle is required to back into a public street to obtain egress.
      (2)   Each parking space shall be not less than 200 square feet in area
and shall be a definitely designated stall adequate for one motor vehicle.
      (3)   In any determination of parking requirements as set forth in this
section, where the resultant figure contains a fraction, any fraction less than
one-half may be dropped and any fraction of one-half or more shall be counted
as one parking space.
      (4)   All areas devoted to permanent off-street parking as required under
this section shall be of such construction and maintained in such a manner that
no dust will result from continuous use.
      (5)   The parking lot shall be drained to eliminate surface water.
      (6)   Where the parking lot abuts side lot lines of a residential
district, there shall be established a setback of five feet from such side lot
line unless vehicles are restrained by physical barrier from entering
contagious residential lots.
      (7)   Where the parking lot is contiguous to a residential district which
has common frontage in the same block with the parking lot, there shall be
established a setback line of ten feet from the street lot line. See §
155.58 for further information.
      (8)   Where the parking lot lies across the street and opposite a
residential district, wherein the lots front on such street, there shall be
established a setback line ten feet from the street lot line. See §
155.58 for further information.
      (9)   Where the parking lot abuts rear property lines of a residential
district, there shall be established a setback line five feet from the rear lot
line unless vehicles are restrained by physical barrier from entering
contiguous residential lots.
      (10)   Where parking is to be provided in the front yard of a multiple
family dwelling, there shall be established a setback line ten feet from the
street lot line. The land between the setback line and the lot line in a
parking lot is, for the purpose of this chapter, called a buffer strip. The
ground in the front buffer strip shall be prepared and shall be planted with
trees, shrubs, and grass.
      (11)   Plans for the layout of a parking lot must be approved by the
governing body based on design standards approved by the Institute of Traffic
Engineers.
      (12)   The governing body shall have the authority to approve off-street
parking in any district which is more restrictive than that required for the
major land use it is intended to serve subject to the preceding conditions. The
following conditions shall also apply:
         (a)   The parking lot shall not have access from the more restrictive
districts;
         (b)   All sides of the lot, except those openings for ingress and
egress, shall be enclosed with an opaque ornamental fence, wall, or dense
evergreen hedge, having a height of not less than five feet nor more than six
feet. Such fence, wall, or hedge shall be maintained in good condition. Bumper
stops shall be provided so as to prevent any vehicle from projecting over the
buffer strip;
         (c)   The intensity of light and arrangement of reflectors shall be
such as not to interfere with residential districts; and
         (d)   No sign of any kind shall be erected except information signs
used to guide traffic and to state the conditions and terms of the use of the
lot. Only non-intermittent white lighting of signs shall be permitted.
   (D)   Ingress and egress. The number of vehicular access driveways permitted
on any single street frontage shall be limited to:
      (1)   One driveway where the parcel to be used has a maximum street
frontage of at least 100 feet;
      (2)   Two driveways where the street frontage exceeds 100 feet upon
application approval; and
      (3)   Driveways used for ingress and egress shall be limited to 25 feet
in width, exclusive of curb returns.

§ 155.62 SIGNS, BILLBOARDS, AND OTHER ADVERTISING STRUCTURES.
   These conditions are established as a reasonable and impartial method of
regulating advertising structures in order to insure safe construction, light,
air, and open space, to reduce hazards at intersections, to prevent the
accumulation of trash, to preclude the establishment of structures which would
afford hiding places for immoral or criminal activities, and to protect
property values of the entire community. The regulations for signs, billboards,
and other advertising structures are indicated below.
   (A)   In any zoning district where signs are permitted, the following
general regulations shall apply.
      (1)   No sign shall be erected or maintained at any location where by
reason of its position, wording, illumination, size, shape, or color it may
obstruct, impair, obscure, interfere with the view of, or be confused with any
authorized traffic control sign, signal, or device. No sign shall be erected in
any position where it obstructs or physically interferes with the driver's view
of approaching, merging, or intersecting traffic.
      (2)   No sign shall contain or make use of any word, phrase, symbol,
shape, form, or character in such manner as to interfere with, mislead, or
confuse traffic.
      (3)   No sign having flashing, intermittent, or animated illumination
shall be permitted within 300 feet of property in a residential district unless
such sign is not visible from such property. Off- premises signs located
adjacent to interstate and primary highways shall not contain, include, or be
illuminated by any flashing, intermittent, or moving light or lights; except
those giving public service information such as time, temperature, weather, or
similar information. All such signs shall be effectively shielded to prevent
any light from being directed onto the highway and shall not be of such
brilliance or intensity as to cause glare on the highway or in any way impair
the driver's vision or otherwise interfere with the safe operation of any
vehicle.
      (4)   No illuminated sign shall be permitted within 50 feet of property
in any residential district unless the illumination of such sign is so designed
that it does not shine or reflect light onto such property.
      (5)   No billboard or ground sign shall be erected to exceed 35 feet
above the ground level or 50 feet in length. The bottom coping of every ground
sign shall be at least three feet above the ground or street level.
      (6)   No roof sign shall be at any point over 24 feet above the roof
level. Roof signs shall not exceed the height limit of the zoning district.
      (7)   No part of any wall or projecting sign that is attached to a
building shall be erected to a height greater than such building, unless the
building and sign are architecturally integrated and designed as a unit.
      (8)   Permanent billboards and other similar outdoor advertising
structure shall be erected or placed in conformity with the side and rear yard
requirements of the district in which located. However, no permanent billboard
shall be erected or placed closer than within 100 feet of any residential
district. Off- premise signs located adjacent to interstate, national highway
system, or primary highways shall be spaced not less than 100 feet apart.
However, this limitation does not apply to signs that are separated by
buildings or other obstructions in such a manner that only one sign surface
within the above spacing stance is visible from the highway at any one time.
All signs located adjacent to interstate, national highway system, or primary
highways shall conform to all state and federal billboard regulations.
      (9)   No advertising sign shall be located in any area designated by the
governing body as one of scenic beauty or historical interest.
      (10)   No building walls shall be used for display of advertising, except
that pertinent to the use on the premises.
      (11)   Temporary signs shall not be erected or otherwise fixed to any
permanent pole, tree, stone, fence, building, structure, or any object within
the right-of-way of any street. No temporary sign shall be erected at the
intersection of, or within, any street in such a manner as to obstruct free and
clear vision, or be confused with any authorized traffic sign, signal, or
device. Temporary signs may be erected or posted for a period not to exceed 30
days. Any sign posted for a longer period must meet the requirements for
permanent signs. No temporary sign shall exceed 32 square feet in area.
      (12)   A temporary sign shall not be suspended across public streets or
other public places, except as permitted by the governing body.
      (13)   No permanent sign shall be placed in any public right-of-way
except publicly owned signs, such as traffic control signs and directional
signs.
      (14)   Signs erected and overhanging any sidewalk must be placed at least
nine feet above the sidewalk and may extend over the sidewalk a distance equal
to two-thirds the width of the sidewalk, but in no case exceeding ten feet.
This regulation does not imply any authority to grant the use of the public
domain for private advertising.
      (15)   Pole signs shall not be over 30 square feet in area and shall be
located not closer then ten feet to any street right-of-way line, and five feet
from any other property line.
      (16)   Professional signs for home occupations, where permitted, shall
not exceed two square feet in area provided such sign is either a wall or
ground sign located not closer than five feet to the street right-of-way line.
      (17)   The area of a sign shall be determined by the smallest circle,
triangle, or rectangle that can be used to enclose the sign, exclusive to
supporting members that bear no message. A sign designed to be viewed from two
opposite directions shall be considered as one sign, provided that the two sign
faces shall not be more than two feet apart if parallel, nor form an angle of
more than 90° if angular. Where more than one sign is permitted on a lot, the
net sign area shall be the sum of those signs designed to be viewed from one
direction, and such signs shall not be less than 20 feet apart.
   (B)   Public parks and recreation areas. The following regulations shall
apply in public parks and recreation areas.
      (1)   For historical monuments, structures, public parks, and/or
playgrounds, information signs may be displayed but the total area of each sign
shall not exceed nine square feet, and signs may have indirect lighting.

unit; such nameplates shall indicate nothing other than name and/or address of
the occupants, premises, announcement of boarders or customary home occupation.
      (2)   Multiple-family and group dwellings. Identification signs, not to
exceed nine square feet in area, shall be permitted; such sign shall be
attached flush with the principal building and may have indirect illumination.
      (3)   Announcement of church, school, or public building. Bulletin boards

§ 155.86 VARIANCES.
   The purpose of the variance is to modify the strict application of the
specific requirements of this chapter in the case of exceptionally irregular,
narrow, shallow, or steep lots, or other exceptional physical conditions,
whereby such strict application would result in practical difficulty or
unnecessary hardship which would deprive an owner of the reasonable use of his
land. The variance shall be used only where necessary to overcome some obstacle
which is preventing an owner from using his lot as the Zoning Ordinance
intended.
   (A)   Application. After written denial of a building permit from the
governing body, a property owner may make application to the governing body for
a variance, using forms obtainable.
   (B)   Public hearing. Upon receipt of an application and fee, the governing
body shall hold a public hearing having first given 15 days notice. Such notice
of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a designated legal
publication. The governing body shall consider and decide all applications for
variances within 30 days of such public hearing and in accordance with the
standards provided below.
   (C)   Standards for variances. In granting a variance, the governing body
shall ascertain that the following criteria are met.
      (1)   Variances shall be granted only where special circumstances or
conditions (such as exceptional narrowness, topography, or siting) as verified
by the finding of the governing body, do not apply generally in the district.
      (2)   Variances shall not be granted to allow a use otherwise excluded
from the particular district in which requested.
      (3)   For reasons fully set forth in the findings of the governing body,
the aforesaid circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application
of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicants of any
reasonable use of his land. Mere loss in value shall not justify a variance;
there must be a deprivation of beneficial use of land.
      (4)   Any variance granted under the provisions of this section shall be
the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land.
      (5)   The granting of any variance is in harmony with general purposes
and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood,
detrimental to the public welfare, or in conflict with the comprehensive plan
for development.
      (6)   A fee, as per the current fee schedule, due and payable at the time
of application, shall be paid to the Town Clerk as agent for the governing
body, to cover the costs of notices and other expenses incidental to the
hearing.

shall have the authority to grant a variance, the persons claiming the variance
have the burden of showing:
      (1)   That the granting of the permit will not be contrary to the public
interest;
      (2)   That the literal enforcement of this chapter will result in
unnecessary hardship;
      (3)   That by granting the permit contrary to the provisions of this
chapter the spirit of this chapter will be observed; and
      (4)   That by granting the permit, substantial justice will be done.

certified copies of all paper acted on by it, and any other information as may
be pertinent and material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from.
   (C)   If, upon the hearing, it shall appear to the court that testimony is
