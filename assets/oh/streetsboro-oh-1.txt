and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification; and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
Council;
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF STREETSBORO,
COUNTY OF PORTAGE, STATE OF OHIO:
   Section 1: That the ordinances of the City of Streetsboro, Ohio, of a
general and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated
into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved,
adopted and reenacted as the Codified Ordinances of Streetsboro, Ohio, 1985.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the City of Streetsboro, Ohio.
   Section 2: That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect from and

which are inconsistent with any provision of the Codified Ordinances, are

affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision, shall

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

unless a contrary intent appears in this Charter or in the enactments of
Council, in such a manner as may be provided by the laws of Ohio.

by the Council. No contract in excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for
the purchase of goods or services, for labor and materials, or for the

with prior approval of Council, except that the Council may establish a dollar
threshold amount below which Council approval is not required. If the Council

lowest and best bid. The Board shall not entertain bids from bidders lacking a
valid Certificate of Qualification issued under Chapter 5525 of the Ohio
Revised Code, if such certificate would be required under state bidding
procedures for the same type of work. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Council, in authorizing any purchase, labor and materials, or public
improvement contract, may specify the use of any alternative form of
competitive process provided for in Ohio law for municipalities or other public
agencies, or may exempt the purchase from competition. In exempting any
procurement from competition, the Council will identify the statutory or common
law basis for the exemption.
   D.   Every contract authorizing expenditure of public money shall include or
have appended to it the Finance Director's certificate of available funds for
the fiscal year involved. No contract lacking such certification shall be valid
against the City, and no expenditures in excess of the amount certified shall
be made unless an additional certification is provided. No contract, once
authorized and executed by the Mayor, shall be modified, amended, or extended
in any manner without further authorization of the Council, or in the case of a
contract not requiring Council approval, by the Board of Control.
   E.   In addition to the above, approval of Council by ordinance shall be

certify to Council, shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the officer
whose removal is sought, and shall make a record of such delivery.

   101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)    The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein. (ORC
1.57)
   (b)    An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance. (ORC 1.54)
   (c)    The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not,
except as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)    Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action

      (2)    Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)    Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

by a re- enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or

(ORC 1.58)

   (c)    Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)

   (a)    If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)    If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)    (1)    If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)    If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)    In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)    Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)    The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
   (b)    An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)    The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history;
      (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY. 
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. (ORC l.50)
   101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

(Ord. 1998-30. Passed 3-23-98.)
   123.03 PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY.
   It is the policy of the City of Streetsboro that open records leads to a
better informed citizenry, which leads to better government and greater public
understanding. The cornerstone of this policy is a strict adherence to the
state’s Public Records Act, Ohio Revised Code Chapter 149 (the “Act”).
   Therefore, all exemptions to this open records policy are to be construed in
the narrowest sense and any denial of public records in response to a valid
request must be accompanied by an explanation, including legal authority, as
outlined in this policy and the Act, and futher request is in writing, the
explanation must also be in writing.
   (a)   Public Records.
      (1)   In accordance with the Act, the City defines records as including
the following: Any document - paper, electronic (including, but not limited to,
e-mail), or other format - that is created or received by, or comes under the
jurisdiction of a public office that documents the organization, functions,
policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office.
All records of the City are public unless they are exempt from disclosure under
the Act. Please note, however, that records related to law enforcement have
unique exemptions under the Act, and records of the law director and prosecutor
are exempt from disclosure requirements based on attorney-client privilege and
work-product in reasonable anticipation of litigation.
      (2)   It is the policy of the City that, as required by the Act, records
will be organized and maintained so that they are readily available for
inspection and copying (see Section (d) for the e-mail records policy). Record
retention schedules are to be updated regularly by the Records Commission and
posted prominently.
   (b)   Record Requests. Each request for public records should be evaluated
for a response using the following guidelines:
      (1)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the City to identify, retrieve and review the records. If it is not
clear what records are being sought, the City records custodian must contact
the requester for clarification, and should assist the requestor in revising
the request by informing the requester of the manner in which the office keeps
its records.
      (2)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing,
and does not have to provide his or her identify or the intended use of the
requested public record. It is the City’s policy that this information is not
to be asked of the requester. However, the City records custodian may ask for a
written request and may ask for the requester’s identity and/or intended use of
the information requested if:
         A.   It would benefit the requester by helping the office identify,
locate or deliver the records being sought, and
         B.   The requestor is informed that a written request and his or her
identity and intended use of the information requested are not required.
      (3)   Public records are to be available for inspection from 8:00 a.m. to
4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday during regular business hours, with the
exception of published holidays. Public records must be made available for
inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be made available within a
reasonable period of time after a request. “Prompt” and “reasonable” take into
account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the location where
the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review of the records
requested.
      (4)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, personnel rosters, and ordinances. If fewer than 20 pages of
copies are requested or if the records are readily available in an electronic
format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these records should be made
as quickly as the equipment allows.
      (5)   All requests for public records must be acknowledged in writing by
the City within three (3) business days following the office’s receipt of the
request. If a request is voluminous or will require research, the
acknowledgement must include the following:
         A.   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request;
         B.   An estimated cost if copies are requested; and
         C.   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
      (6)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest of the record is to
be released. If there are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a
supporting explanation, including legal authority.
      (7)   All requests for public records must be addressed to the City
office responsible for such records or generally to the Mayor’s Office. Each
office shall use the “Voluntary Public Records Request Form” (shown in attached
Exhibit “A”) in processing records requests. The head or supervisor of each
City department shall be the person responsible for public records requests and
training (and designation of a records custodian, if appropriate). The City
will provide training to all supervisors, department heads, and designated
staff in accordance with the Act. A copy of this policy shall be posted in each
City office at a location viewable to the public, and be included in the
“Employee Handbook”. A “Public Informational Poster” shall be posted at the
Police Department, Fire Department, Service Department, City Hall and Mayor’s
Office in a conspicuous place viewable to the public.
   (c)   Costs for Public Records.  
      (1)   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost
of making copies.
         A.   The charge for paper copies is five cents ($0.05) per single-
sided black/white page, ten cents ($0.10) per double-sided black/white page,
ten cents ($0.10) per single-sided color copy, twenty cents ($0.20) per double-
sided color copy.
         B.   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is one
dollar ($1.00) per disc.
         C.   The charge for audio cassettes is four dollars and eighty-five
cents ($4.85) per cassette.
         D.   There is no charge for records e-mailed.
      (2)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. If so, the
requester will be charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
         A.   Those seeking public records will be required to make a deposit
equal to the anticipated amount that copying the requested copies will cost.
   (d)   E-mail.
      (1)   Records in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Act
when their content relates to the business of the City office. E-mail is to be
treated in the same fashion as records in other formats and should follow the
same retention schedules, unless otherwise expressly stated.
      (2)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business
might be subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of the
City are instructed to retain their e-mails that relate to public business (see
subsection (a) Public Records) and to copy them to a separate file or to the
office’s records custodian.
      (3)   The City office records custodian is to treat the e-mails from
private accounts as records of the office, filing them in the appropriate way,
retaining them per schedules established by the Records Commission and making
them available for inspection and copying in accordance with this policy and
the Act.
   (e)   Failure to Respond to a Public Records Request. The City recognizes
the legal and non-legal consequences of failure to properly respond to a public
records request. In addition to the distrust in government that failure to
comply may cause, the City’s failure to comply with a request may result in a
court ordering the City to comply with the law and to pay the requester’s
attorney’
 
   123.04 CONTRACT AND PURCHASES RECORDS-KEEPING POLICY.
   Council establishes the following record-keeping policy:
   (a)   A copy of all contracts authorized by Council and the legislation or,

   (e)   All original, executed contracts shall be kept in the Finance

(Ord. 2021-154. Passed 10-25-21.)
133.051  CREDIT CARD, ONLINE AND OPEN ACCOUNT PURCHASES.
   (a)   As used in this Section:
      (1)   "Credit card account" means any line of credit made available to
the City by a financial institution or other entity, documented by a physical
card and a unique account number, allowing the possessor of the card to
purchase goods or services on credit or to engage in other financial
transactions using the account information. For the purposes of this Section,
"Credit card accounts" includes merchant cards and fleet cards.
      (2)   "Merchant card" means a credit card that can be used only at a
designated merchant.
      (3)   "Fleet card" means a credit card that can be used to purchase only
one type of service or commodity (e.g., gasoline).
      (4)   "Open account" means any arrangement with a vendor, including an
online vendor, under which the vendor will fill orders from City employees
without verifying the employee's purchasing authority or the existence of an
applicable purchase order.
   (b)   Credit card accounts, under which the City bears liability for
purchases, will be established only in the name of the City and will be used
only for authorized City purchases and only in conformance with this Section.
New credit card accounts will be authorized only on written approval of the
Mayor and the Finance Director. The Finance Director shall process the
issuance, reissuance and cancellation of credit card accounts.
   (c)   The Mayor will from time to time specify in writing those employees or
positions that are authorized to have custody of City credit cards ("card
custodians"), and the Mayor shall promptly revise the list of card custodians
when personnel changes occur. A current roster of card custodians and the
credit cards they are permitted to possess will be kept in the Finance
Director's office at all times. Card custodians will be responsible for the
security of the credit card(s) issued to them and will immediately notify the
Finance Director in the event a card is lost or stolen. A card custodian who
separates from City employment shall immediately return possession of all
credit cards to the Finance Director. Separation payments may be withheld until
credit cards are returned.
   (d)   Credit card and open account purchases may be made only in conformance
with a valid, previously approved purchase order. Any employee making a
purchase in violation of this requirement will be subject to disciplinary
action.
   (e)   No persons other than the card custodians will execute credit card
purchases, except that card custodians may transfer possession of credit cards
to authorized employees to make off-site purchases from retail merchants, or to
pay for travel expenses when out of town on official business. The card
custodian will retake possession of the card immediately thereafter. Receipts
for credit card and open account purchases will be supplied to the Finance
Department no later than the business day next following the purchase or, if
the employee is out of town, the next business day in which the employee is at
his or her City office or workplace. Whenever possible, the receipts supplied
to support the purchase shall include documentation from the vendor showing the
vendor's name, items purchased, date, location and price; not merely the credit
card transaction receipt.
   (f)   To the extent the City possesses credit card accounts that earn
affinity "points" or other rewards, such rewards will remain the property of
the City. Products, services or money obtained through redemption of any such
rewards are the property of the City. Redemption of points or rewards will be
made only on written request of a department head with approval of the Finance
Director and the Mayor.
   (g)    No checks shall be written against a credit card account and no cash
advances shall be authorized. If blank checks are received from a card issuer,
they will be immediately submitted to the Finance Director for destruction.
   (h)   The requirements of Section
133.05 apply to all credit card and open account purchases. No credit card
issued in the name of the City shall have a credit limit in excess of one
hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000).
   (i)   The Financial Assistant will, quarterly, review the number of credit
cards and accounts issued, the number of active cards and accounts issued, the
cards' and accounts' expiration dates, and the cards' and accounts' credit
limits. The Financial Assistant will provide a report of each such review to
the Mayor, Finance Director, and the Clerk of Council. (Ord. 2024-109. Passed
7-22-24.)
   133.06  BID REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Requirements of Ohio R.C. 153.50, 153.51 and 153.52, with regard to
separate bids and separate contracts for each separate and distinct trade and
kind of mechanical labor, employment or business entering into the improvement,
shall not govern the bidding procedures of the City.
   (b)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as to authorize the City to
proceed without competitive bidding for the general contract, to be awarded to
the lowest and best bidder.
   (c)   Officers, boards or other authority of the City shall be permitted to
grant one bid for all work and materials on one specific contract and shall not
be required to contract with each individual trade, mechanical labor employment
or business entering into the improvement.
   (d)   Should Council and the Administration determine that it is
economically prudent to renew an existing contract for the general liability
insurance of the City; health insurance; life insurance, or other insurance
coverage, whether insuring the City, or providing benefits to employees of the
City, nothing in this section shall be construed to require the formal bidding
annually, under O.R.C. 735.05, or statute of similar import subject to the
provisions of Section
133.06(e).
   (e)   However, the City shall solicit bids at least once every five (5)
years for contracts for the general liability insurance of the City; health
insurance; life insurance, or other insurance, or other insurance coverage,

(Res. 2009-79. Passed 7-27-09.)
   133.11 GENERAL FUND CARRYOVER BALANCE POLICY.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Unencumbered General Fund Carryover Balance” means, for each
fiscal year, the unappropriated balance of the General Fund (Fund 101) after
all expenditures and encumbrances have been made, estimated at the beginning of
the fiscal year in the annual budget ordinance.
      (2)   “Actual Year-End Fund Balance” means the actual Unencumbered
General Fund Carryover Balance for any fiscal year reported after the books
have been closed for that fiscal year.
      (3)   “Estimated Final Balance” means the Finance Director’s monthly
estimate of the Actual Year-End Fund Balance produced at any point during the
fiscal year, taking into account actual financial (revenue) results and
supplemental or amended appropriations made during that fiscal year.
      (4)   “Current Year Estimated Resources” means anticipated revenue that
will be received by the General Fund (Fund 101) in a fiscal year, reported to
the Council in the annual budget submission made by the Mayor pursuant to
Section 3.04(D) of the City Charter. Tax revenue that is directly deposited to
the Capital Improvement Fund, the General Bond Retirement Fund, the Police
Pension Fund, the Parks Improvement Fund, the Convention and Visitors Fund, or
other funds other than the General Fund, pursuant to Section 
133.12  of this Chapter or other ordinances, is not included in Estimated
Resources.
      (5)   “Annual appropriations” means the annual General Fund expenditures
authorized by City Council through an annual budget ordinance.
   (b)   It is the policy of the City to maintain a minimum Unencumbered
General Fund Carryover Balance in order to assure financial stability and
provide adequate financial reserves capable of preserving City operations in
the event of economic stress or unforeseen financial events. The Unencumbered
General Fund Carryover Balance shall be established in each annual budget
ordinance and shall not be less than twenty-five percent (25%) of Annual
Appropriations for that fiscal year.
   (c)   The Mayor’s annual budget submission made pursuant to Section
3.04 (D) of the Charter will reflect a carryover balance calculated in
compliance with the above, unless the Council, upon the Mayor’s recommendation,
determines in advance that this policy may be waived for the fiscal year in
question. After submission of the budget, the Council may determine on its own
to adjust or waive this policy to meet the needs dictated by current financial
or economic conditions.
   (d)   Provided that the Mayor’s annual budget submission reflects compliance
with this policy, the portion of the Actual Year-End Fund Balance of the prior
fiscal year that exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) may be proposed for
appropriation in the annual budget submission, notwithstanding that it may
result in a budget in which Annual Appropriations exceed Current Year Estimated
Resources. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the Council’s
authority to amend the Mayor’s annual budget submission prior to adoption.
   (e)   The Finance Director will report monthly to the Council on the state
of revenues and expenditures under the budget, including whether the Estimated
Final Balance is consistent with the original budget plan, taking into account
actual financial (revenue) results and any supplemental or amended
appropriations made during the then-current fiscal year. If the Finance
Director reports that the Estimated Fund Balance will not meet the requirements
of this Policy, the Council will consider whether to i) waive the policy, or
ii) enact immediate revenue enhancements and/or reduction of appropriations in
order to bring the City’s revenue and expenditures into conformance with the
policy.
   (f)   The Council’s decision to waive or enforce the policy shall be guided
by the nature of the event that causes the financial stress at issue. If a
large, unanticipated, one-time expenditure or anomalous revenue failure causes
the Estimated Final Balance to fall below 25%, the policy should be waived with
the assumption that it will be corrected in the next budget or, if necessary,
over a period of years under a plan separately approved by the Council. If the
stress is caused by long-term deteriorating economic trends or permanently
changed revenue source factors, the Council should act under the policy to
preserve the Unencumbered General Fund Carryover Balance, in order to maintain
long term financial stability. (Ord. 2016-125. Passed 11-28-16.)
   133.12 ALLOCATION OF INCOME TAX REVENUE.
   Effective January 1, 2021 and until changed by ordinance, all proceeds of

   134.01  ESTABLISHED.
   There is hereby established an Income Tax Department. The Finance Director
shall be the department head and shall be the Chief Tax Administrator. He may
appoint such Assistant Tax Administrators as he shall deem necessary and
appropriate, in addition to, or concurrent with the powers and duties set forth
in Chapter
181 of the Codified Ordinances of Streetsboro.
(Ord. 1998-84. Passed 7-6-98.)
   134.02  DUTIES OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR. 
   (a)   (1)   The Administrator and his or her assistants, in cooperation with
any designated income tax collection agency, such as the Regional Income Tax
Agency (“RITA”), shall receive all municipal income taxes imposed and received
from taxpayers; shall keep an accurate record thereof; and shall report all
moneys so received.
      (2)   The Administrator and his or her assistants, in cooperation with
any designated income tax collection agency, such as the Regional Income Tax
Agency (“RITA”), shall enforce payment of all taxes owing this Municipality,
shall keep accurate records for a minimum of five years showing the amount due
from each taxpayer required to file a declaration and make any return,
including taxes withheld, and shall show the dates and amounts of payments
thereof. The more liberal of the powers set forth herein or in Chapter
181 of the Streetsboro Codified Ordinances shall govern.
   (b)   The Administrator and his or her assistants, in cooperation with any
designated income tax collection agency, such as the Regional Income Tax Agency
(“RITA”), is charged with the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter,
and is empowered, subject to the approval of the Board of Review, to adopt and
promulgate and to enforce rules and regulations relating to any matter or thing
pertaining to the collection of taxes, disallowance of deductions as provided
in subsection (c) hereof, and the administration and enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, including provisions for the reexamination and
correction of returns. The Administrator is authorized to arrange for the
payment of unpaid taxes, interest and penalties on a schedule of installment
payments when the taxpayer has proved to the Administrator that, due to certain
hardship conditions, he is unable to pay the full amount of tax due.
Authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him under this chapter. Failure to make any
deferred payment when due shall cause the total unpaid amount, including
penalty and interest, to become payable on demand. The more liberal of the
powers set forth herein or in Chapter
181 of the Streetsboro Codified Ordinances shall govern.
   (c)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, due to excessive
deductions, misallocation of income or otherwise, the Administrator may
determine the amount of tax appearing to be due this Municipality from the
taxpayer by reallocation of income, disallowance of a proportionate portion of
the claimed deductions, or otherwise and shall send to the taxpayer a written
statement showing the amount of tax so determined, together with the method for
determination thereof and the interest and penalties thereon, if any. The
burden shall rest on the taxpayer, by timely production of his books and
records or otherwise, to substantiate his return and absent such proof, the
determination of the Administrator shall be final. The more liberal of the
powers set forth herein or in Chapter
181 of the Streetsboro Codified Ordinances shall govern.
   (d)   The Administrator shall have the power to compromise any interest or
penalty, or both. In cases of tax return discrepancies of five dollars ($5.00)
or less, the Tax Administrator shall have the authority to officially waive
collection of such amount(s) when the anticipated cost of collection shall
exceed five dollars ($5.00). The more liberal of the powers set forth herein or
in Chapter
181 of the Streetsboro Codified Ordinances shall govern.
(Ord. 1998-84. Passed 7-6-98.)
   134.03  INVESTIGATIVE POWERS OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   The Administrator, in cooperation with any designated income tax
collection agency, or any authorized employee, is authorized to examine the
books, records and federal income tax returns of any employer or of any
taxpayer or person subject to, or whom the Administrator believes is subject
to, the provisions of this chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made, or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due under this
chapter. Every such employer, supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed taxpayer
is directed and required to furnish on written request by the Administrator, or
his duly authorized agent or employee, the means, facilities and opportunity
for making such examinations and investigations as are hereby authorized.
   (b)   The Administrator, in cooperation with any designated income tax
collection agency, is authorized to order any person presumed to have knowledge
of the facts to appear before him and may examine the person, under oath,
concerning any income which was or should have been returned for taxation, or
any transaction tending to affect the income, and for this purpose may compel
the production of books, papers, records and federal income tax returns and the
attendance of all persons before him, whether as parties or witnesses, whenever
he believes those persons have knowledge of the income or information pertinent
to the inquiry.
   (c)   The refusal to produce books, papers, records and federal income tax
returns, or the refusal to submit to such examination by any employer or person
subject to or presumed to be subject to the tax or by any officer, agent or
employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax or the
failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this section or with an
order or subpoena of the Administrator authorized hereby shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter.
   (d)   Any information gained as the result of any returns, investigations,
hearings or verifications required or authorized by this chapter shall be
confidential, and no disclosure thereof shall be made except to municipal,
state or federal taxing agencies and except in accordance with proper judicial
order.
   (e)   Every taxpayer shall return all records necessary to compute his tax
liability for a period five years from the date his return is filed, or the
withholding taxes are paid. The more liberal of the powers set forth herein or
in Chapter
181 of the Streetsboro Codified Ordinances shall govern.
(Ord. 1998-84. Passed 7-6-98.)
   134.04 TAXPAYERS' BILL OF RIGHTS.
   The following rights and considerations apply to every taxpayer or potential
taxpayer in the City of Streetsboro:
   (a)   Courtesy and Consideration. As a taxpayer, you are entitled to
courteous, considerate and fair treatment from Streetsboro Tax Department
employees at all times. If you ever feel that you are not being offered such
treatment, you should inform the City Tax Administrator. If your complaint is
about the Tax Administrator, you should contact the Finance Director.
   (b)   Payment of Only the Required Tax. You are liable only for the correct
amount of tax which is due and payable. Equal standards of payment are required
to be consistently and fairly applied to all taxpayers.
   (c)   Your Return May Be Questioned. The City Tax Department reviews all tax
returns for correctness. If we inquire about your return or select it for
further examination, it does not suggest that you are dishonest or that
something is wrong. It only indicates that something needs to be clarified. The
examination may or may not result in more taxes being assessed. We may close
your case without change to your return or you may receive a refund.
   (d)   Examination and Inquiries by Mail. The City Tax Office handles most
examinations and inquiries by mail. If necessary, we shall send you a letter
with either a request for more information or a reason why we believe a change
needs to be made in your return. If you provide the requested information or a
suitable explanation, a personal interview will probably not be needed.
However, you may request a personal interview if you wish or we may schedule a
personal interview to review your records.
   (e)   Examination by Interview. If we request a personal interview to review
your records, you may bring your records to the Streetsboro Tax Office and
leave them or you may stay while we review and/or copy your records. The amount
of time involved will depend upon the volume and orderliness of the records. We
will try to schedule your examination at a reasonable time that is convenient
for you. However, if the parties are unable to agree, the Streetsboro Tax
Department has the authority to make the final determination of how, when and
where the examination will take place.
   (f)   Representation. Throughout your dealings with the Tax Department and
its employees, you can represent your self or your tax preparer or attorney may
represent you. Most differences can be settled by presenting additional facts
or information. It is not required to have a tax preparer or attorney appear
for you. However, if at any time during a tax review you want to consult an
attorney or your tax preparer or any other person you wish to represent you, we
will stop and reschedule the interview. However, we cannot suspend the
interview if you are there because of an administrative summons. In such case,
provisions for representation shall be made prior to the start of the
interview.
   (g)   Explanation of Additional Tax Liability. If we suggest or request any
changes to your return or tax liability, we shall explain the reasons for the
changes or the levy of additional taxes. You should not hesitate to request
information or to ask about anything that is unclear to you. Whenever you owe
additional taxes, we shall send you a bill stating the reason for the invoice
as well as any amounts you may owe, including interest and penalties, if
applicable. You have the right to have your bill adjusted if it is incorrect.
Please let us know immediately if you believe we have sent you an incorrect
bill. If you believe that you are entitled to a refund, file the request with
the Tax Administrator at the earliest possible date.
   (h)   Interest. You are liable for interest on additional taxes that you
owe, if such taxes were not paid by the appropriate due date. Interest is
calculated from the original due date of the payment.
   (i)   An Appeal of the Examination Findings. If you don't agree with the
review or examination findings, you have the right to appeal them. If, within
thirty days from the date of the findings, you wish to appeal, you shall state
your reasons for such appeal in writing and mail or present such appeal to the
Tax Administrator who will schedule a hearing before the Streetsboro Income Tax
Board of Review as soon as possible. Most differences can be settled through
this appeal system without expensive and time-consuming court trials. If the
matter cannot be settled to your satisfaction by the Tax Board of Review, you
may pursue your case through the court system.
   (j)   Cancellation of Penalties. You have the right to ask that certain
penalties or interest be canceled (abated) by the Tax Administrator if you can
demonstrate reasonable cause for the filing or payment failure that led to the
penalty. The appeal process described in subsection (i) hereof also applies to
the assessment of penalties and interest.
   (k)   Payment Arrangements. You are required by law to make every effort to
pay your taxes in full when they are due. If you can't, you should pay as much
as you can and contact the Tax Office immediately to attempt to arrange payment
plan. We may ask you for a complete financial statement to determine your
ability to pay the amount due. Based on your financial condition, you may
qualify for an installment agreement.
      If a payment agreement is approved, it shall be prepared in writing for
the protection of all concerned. We shall provide you with copies of all
agreements you make with the Tax Department. If we approve a payment agreement,
the agreement shall stay in effect only if:
      (1)   You give correct and complete financial information.
      (2)   You pay each installment on time.
      (3)   You satisfy other Streetsboro tax liabilities on time.
      (4)   You provide current financial information when asked.
   (l)   Enforcement. The Tax Office ordinarily does not initiate any
enforcement action until after we have tried to contact you and offered you the
opportunity to voluntarily pay any taxes due. It is very important for you to
respond immediately to our attempts to contact you. If you do not respond, we
have no choice but to begin formal enforcement proceedings by civil suit or
criminal charges. The penalties for violation of the Income Tax Code are
defined in Section
181.1505 of the Streetsboro Codified Ordinances.
   (m)   Privacy and Confidentiality. You have the right to have your personal
and financial information kept confidential. According to both state and local
law, all such records are required to be kept confidential and may be used only
for official purposes.
   (n)   Taxpayer Assistance. All City tax forms are designed to be self-
explanatory. Except for the more complicated tax situations, most tax payers
will not need the assistance of an accountant or attorney to file a tax return.
The City Tax Office attempts to provide limited free assistance in providing
tax returns. However, the City is not able to offer unlimited professional
advice and can guarantee help only to the extent that the department staff is
available to do so.
   (o)   Requests for Information and Documents. Most general information
requested from the Tax Office by a taxpayer shall be made available free of
charge. This includes pertinent sections of the City Tax Code. Requests for
multiple copies of forms and/or copies of the entire City Tax Code, however,
are subject to a nominal fee.
   (p)   Conflicting Provisions. This section is intended only to clarify and
generally delineate taxpayers' rights. The actual application of any provision
of this chapter shall be as specifically defined in each section of this
chapter. In the event of conflict between this section and any other section or
provision of this chapter, such other section or provisions shall take
precedence over this section.

the written notification. The charge shall not be assessed if the Fire Chief
determines that the alarm system was installed or substantially changed within
the previous sixty (60) days from the date of the false alarm and the false
alarm was not the result of negligence.
 
   (e)   The Finance Director shall, upon notification of the respective
Chiefs, give five (5) days notice by regular mail to the owner of such
property, at the owner’s last known address, to pay the fees set forth herein.

(Res. 1992-43. Passed 3-24-92.)
   147.02  POLICY AGAINST HARASSMENT, INCLUDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (a)    Statement of City Philosophy. The City of Streetsboro is committed to
maintaining a professional and collegial work environment in which all
individuals are treated with respect and dignity. Each individual has the right
to work in a professional atmosphere, which prohibits discriminatory practices,
including sexual harassment.
   (b)   Introduction. It is the policy of the City to maintain a working
environment free of all forms of sexual and other unlawful harassment, in
accordance with the anti-harassment guidance issued by the United States Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission. Sexual harassment in any manner or form is
expressly prohibited. All incidents of harassment will be promptly and
thoroughly investigated by the City and the City will take prompt and
appropriate corrective action. Any elected official or employee (including
seasonal, temporary, parttime, fulltime, or agent of the City) who engages in
any action or conduct constituting harassment will be subject to appropriate
disciplinary action.
   (c)   Procedure.
      (1)   Definition. Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to:
unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, sexual flirtations,
continued or repeated verbal comments or abuse of a sexual nature; display of
suggestive pictures or objects; sexually-oriented jokes, innuendoes, and
materials, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that affects
an individual’s employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work
performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.
Sexual harassment also includes taking (or refusing to take) personnel action
on the basis of an employee’s submission to (or refusal of) sexual overtures.
Prohibited sexual harassment can be initiated by the person of the same sex, or
by non-employees (for example, City consultants, customers, invitees,
suppliers, contract workers, and vendors). The victim does not have to be the
person harassed, but could be anyone affected by the offensive conduct.
Harassment includes, but is not limited to: comments, gestures, drawings,
writings or physical actions based on another employee’s race/color, religious
beliefs, sex, national origin, disability or age, including slurs, jokes,
offensive or derogatory comments, acts or threats of violence (including death
threats and defacing or damaging of property).
Such behavior is unacceptable in the workplace itself and by any employee in
any work related setting outside the workplace, including, but not limited to,
settings such as business trips, court appearances and business-related social
events.
Consenting romantic and sexual relationships between employees are not
expressly forbidden, but such relationships are considered unwise because
factors such as real or perceived power of one person over another may override
claims of consent at a later date; and such relationships may be offensive to
other employees.
      (2)   Individuals Covered by this Policy. This policy covers all
employees and elected officials. The City will not tolerate harassment whether
engaged in by fellow employees, supervisors, department heads or elected
officials; or by other non-employees who conduct business with this City (for
example, consultants, customers, invitees, suppliers, contract workers and
vendors). The City encourages reporting of all incidents of harassment,
regardless of who the alleged harasser may be, in accordance with this policy.
      (3)   Responsibility.
         A.   The City of Streetsboro. The City has an obligation to take
appropriate remedial action in instances in which it knows of sexual or other
unlawful harassment. Additionally, the City may be accountable for acts of
harassment in those instances in which it is reasonable to conclude that the
City should have known or had reason to know of such acts.
         B.   City management. All levels of the City’s supervision,
management, officers, and officials are responsible for:
            1.   Assuring employees that sexual and other forms of unlawful
harassment are prohibited by the City’s policy and that the City will conduct
an investigation of alleged incidents of harassment and take prompt and
effective correction action; and
            2.   Promptly reporting all alleged incidents of harassment to the
appropriate person; and
            3.   Regularly monitoring of the workplace for indications of
harassment and educating all staff on the City’s anti- harassment policy.
         C.   City employees. An employee who reports an incident of sexual
harassment to the City will be informed that an investigation of the alleged
harassment will be conducted by the City and the City will take that prompt and
effective corrective action. At the time of the complaint, the employee will be
advised that retaliation against the employee will not be tolerated.
      (4)   Violations of Policy. All alleged violations of the City’s anti-
harassment policy may be reported to the employee’s immediate supervisor (or if
he or she is the harasser to the department head or mayor), who in turn will
report the alleged violation to their department head, the mayor or the law
director. The mayor will ensure that all alleged violations are thoroughly
investigated.
      (5)   How to Report a Complaint.
         A.   Informal procedure. The City encourages individuals who believe
they are being harassed to clearly and promptly notify the offender that his or
her behavior is unwelcome. If for any reason an individual does not
successfully end the harassment, then the individual should notify his or her
immediate supervisor (or if he or she is the alleged harasser the department
head or mayor) who may talk to the alleged harasser or arrange for mediation
between the individual and the alleged harasser with a third person acceptable
to both parties). This informal procedure is not a required first step for the
reporting individual but is encouraged to resolve such matters quickly and
effectively.
         B.   Formal procedure. If the reporting individual does not wish to
pursue the informal procedure or it does not produce a result satisfactory to
the reporting individual, the following steps should be followed to initiate a
formal complaint:
            1.   Notification of a member of the staff. An individual who
believes he or she has been subjected to harassment should report the incident
to his or her immediate supervisor (or if he or she is the alleged harasser to
the department head or mayor). The person receiving the complaint shall
immediately file a written description of the allegations with the mayor.
            2.   Upon receipt of the written description, the mayor shall
select three (3) disinterested individuals from his or her staff to investigate
the allegations and render a report to the mayor (or if the mayor is the
alleged harasser to the law director) within 30 days. Upon receipt of the
report, the mayor (or if the mayor is the alleged harasser the law director)
shall decide the matter. An investigation should be confidential to insure the
privacy of the persons involved. Both the complainant and the alleged harasser
should be reminded of the confidential nature of the process. Violations of
confidentiality may be the subject of disciplinary action.
            3.   Following a thorough investigation, prompt and effective
corrective action will be taken by the City.
Disciplinary Procedure.
               a.   The disciplinary action taken with respect to each
violation of this policy must be commensurate with the seriousness of the
particular offense. Accordingly, the City must act deliberately to ensure that
investigations are thorough and that appropriate disciplinary action is applied
in a timely, consistent, and uniform manner.
               b.   In the event that a thorough investigation of an alleged
incident of sexual or other unlawful harassment reveals that the alleged
harasser has not engaged in any actions or conduct constituting sexual
harassment, the City will inform both the alleged harasser and the complainant
that a thorough investigation has been conducted and that there exists no
grounds or basis to substantiate the allegation.
               c.   In the event that a thorough investigation of an alleged
incident of sexual or other unlawful harassment reveals that the alleged
harasser has engaged in actions or conduct constituting unlawful harassment,
the City will, at a minimum, issue a written warning to such individual that
will concurrently advise him or her that additional or further acts of unlawful
harassment could result in further disciplinary action, up to and including
immediate suspension and termination of employment or contract. However, in
instances in which the City determines through the investigation that the
alleged harasser has engaged in conduct or actions that constitute a serious
violation of its anti-harassment policy, then such individual may be subject to
immediate termination of employment, or contract, notwithstanding any general
progressive procedure for other disciplinary actions. Examples of serious
violations of this policy include, but are not limited to, the following:
                  i.   Posting or displaying graffiti, drawings, or offensive
material (sexual, racial, ethnic, religious, age, disability or gender); or
                  ii.   Comments, jokes, advances or propositions (sexual,
racial, ethnic, religious, age, disability or gender); or
                  iii.   Physical conduct of an offensive nature (sexual,
racial, ethnic, religious, age, disability or gender); or
                  iv.   Ostracizing or otherwise discriminating against or
retaliation against employees because of their sexual, racial, ethnic,
religious, age, disability or gender; or because they have complained of
harassment.
               d.   The City will document all matters related to complaints of
alleged sexual or other harassment, including contents of meetings, interviews,
results of investigations and all other actions attendant to the allegation.
Following an investigation and the completion of appropriate corrective
measures, the City will advise the complainant, and other staff with an
official need to know, that a thorough investigation has been conducted and
that appropriate corrective action has been taken by the City. The specific
corrective action will be disclosed to the complainant.
      (6)   Retaliation Prohibited. There shall be no discrimination or
retaliation of any kind against an individual who reports or files a complaint
or charge alleging sexual or other harassment; who gives testimony or
assistance; or who participates in any manner in any investigation, proceeding
or hearing.
      (7)   Maintaining a Written Record of the Complaint. The City shall
maintain a complete record of each complaint in a confidential manner to the
extent practical and appropriate in the office of the law director.
      (8)   Mediation. As an alternative for those wishing to resolve disputes
among themselves without resorting to this policy, the City will, if all
parties agree, make available a trained outside mediator to help find an
amicable, informal solution. If mediation does not solve the problem, the
procedures in this policy may still be used.
      (9)   Conclusion. This policy will be immediately disseminated to all
individuals covered by this policy and the City will provide this policy to all
new employees and elected officials at the time of hire or swearing in. The
mayor will conduct informal sessions with City employees, officers, and
officials concerning this policy, so as to ensure all individuals understand
the City’s commitment to eliminating any harassment in the workplace, are
familiar with the policy and know that any complaint received will be
investigated and appropriately resolved.

conviction of the employee for a felony or misdemeanor occurring in the

       (3)    That as a result of such conviction, the City maintains the right
to:
         A.   Terminate the employee; or
         B.   Require such employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug or
alcohol abuse assistance or rehabilitation program for such purposes by a
federal, state or local health, law enforcement or other appropriate agency at

substance in state or federal regulations or legislation.
       (3)    “Employee” means the employee of the City of Streetsboro engaged

(Ord. 2001-137. Passed 7-23-01.)
   147.06 VACATION LEAVE.
   (a)    All full-time employees shall accrue paid vacation leave upon
commencement of employment and shall be awarded and entitled to use earned
vacation leave annually beginning on the January 1st of the calendar year
following the employee's hire date and on January 1st of each subsequent
calendar year. The rates of accrual and amount of paid vacation leave awarded
and available for use shall be as determined in subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   Vacation time shall be taken at a time approved in advance by the
Department Head or the Mayor. The days of vacation are in terms of working
hours and forty (40) hours are considered to be one week of vacation. Part-time
employees, temporary (seasonal) employees, elected officials, and independent

amount of vacation earned, awarded and available for use in the first year of
employment and all subsequent years of employment shall be determined according
to the following schedule:

thereafter         each year thereafter        hrs. in each year thereafter
   (d)   Employees hired with prior full-time service with the State of Ohio or
any political subdivision of the State may have their vacation leave accrual
rate adjusted according to the duration of full-time service completed with
such prior employers if such employment cumulatively exceeds one year. The
duration of prior service considered shall be in increments of one year only,
and fractional years will be rounded down to the nearest full year. For
vacation accrual purposes only, an employee receiving prior service credit will
have the credit time added to the employee's accrual rate effective as of
January 1st of the employee's second calendar year of employment. (Example: an
employee hired with 3 years and 8 months of recognized prior service credit
will, on January 1st of the employee's second calendar year of employment, be
deemed for vacation accrual purposes only to be at the start of his or her 5th
calendar year of employment.) To be recognized, prior service must be
independently documented by the prior employer(s) and such documentation shall
be maintained in the employee's personnel record.
   (e)   Notwithstanding and as an exception to subsections (a), (c) and (d)
above, lateral hires hired after July 7, 2023 with prior service creditable
under subsection (d) will, on their hire date, be immediately assigned to a
deemed year of employment in the subsection (c) schedule corresponding with
their prior service credit, and shall be immediately awarded usable vacation
leave corresponding to their deemed calendar year of employment, prorated from
the date of hire to December 31 of the year of hire. On January 1 of the
lateral hire’s second actual calendar year of employment, a lateral employee
will be awarded vacation leave based on a full year of service in their
completed deemed year of employment and accrue future vacation leave based on
their next deemed year of employment. (Example: A lateral hire with 5 years of
creditable prior service credit, hired on July 1, will be deemed in his/her
6th year of employment, and will be immediately credited with 60 hours of
usable vacation leave, (prorated from the 120 hours provided for a full year
per the subsection (c) schedule). On January 1 of the lateral hire’s second
actual year of employment, the lateral hire will be deemed in his/her 7th year
of employment and will be awarded 128 hours of vacation leave and accrue future
vacation leave as provided for the 7th calendar year of employment in the
subsection (c) schedule.) For the purposes of this Section, “lateral hire”
means a full-time employee hired with no break in service from the State of
Ohio or another political subdivision of the state, into the same or
substantially similar classification as the one previously held.
   (f)   All vacation leave shall be taken in increments of eight (8) hours or
ten (10) hours for employees who work ten-hour days. Office and administrative
staff who work independently and do not require a replacement to cover for
them, are eligible to use vacation in 2-hour increments with approval of the
Department Head or Mayor. After six months of initial employment, an employee
may be permitted to take up to one week of vacation "in advance." Such vacation
paid in advance shall be deducted from the employee's last paycheck if the
employee separates from the City, for any reason, prior to serving one full
year of employment.
   
   (g)   Vacations are not cumulative and shall not be postponed until the
following year unless there have been exceptional circumstances which caused
postponement. A maximum of ten (10) days may be carried forward. In such cases,
a written request for holdover must be approved by the Mayor or the Council
President if the request is made by the Clerk of Council. All leave carried
over must be taken within the first three (3) months of the year.
   (h)   Absence due to sickness, injury or disability in excess of that
hereinafter authorized for such a purpose, may, at the request of the employee,

period, the employee shall not be charged for a day of vacation.
   (j)   Retired or deceased employees shall be entitled to vacation pay for
the months worked. The vacation pay shall be computed on the basis of one-
twelfth (1/12) of their entitled vacation as determined herein for each month
in which an employee worked a minimum of one (1) full pay period. In the
instance of deceased employees, the vacation pay shall be made to the
deceased's beneficiaries or estate.

terminating employees may qualify for no more than a pro rata vacation credit
based upon the calendar year and the years of service compared to their date of

   148.02  EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY CLAUSE.
   All public contracts hereinafter entered into by the City shall incorporate
an Equal Employment Opportunity Clause, which shall read as follows:
    (a)    The contractor shall not discriminate against any employee or
applicant for employment because of race, religion, color, sex or national
origin. The contractor shall take affirmative action to insure that applicants
are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard
to their race, religion, color, sex or national origin. As used herein the word

whether by advertising or other means; compensated, whether in the form of
rates of pay, or other forms of compensation; selected for training, including

clause.
    (b)    The contractor shall, in all solicitations or advertisements for

purposes of investigation to ascertain compliance with the program.
    (e)    The contractor shall file and shall cause his subcontractors, if

prescribed by the City. Compliance reports filed at such times as directed
shall contain information as to the employment practices, policies, programs
and statistics of the contractor and his subcontractors.
    (f)    The contractor shall include the provisions of this Equal Employment
Opportunity Clause in every subcontract or purchase order so that such
provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor.
    (g)    Refusal by the contractor or subcontractor to comply with any
portion of this program as herein stated and described will subject the
offending party to any or all of the following penalties:

contract to the contractor in violation until it is determined that the
contractor or subcontractor is in compliance with the provisions of the
contract;

of the performance bond;
       (4)    In cases where there is substantial or material violation or the

enforce those provisions, including the enjoining, within applicable law, of
contractors, subcontractors or other organizations, individuals or groups who
prevent directly, indirectly, or seek to prevent directly or indirectly,
compliance with the policy, as herein outlined.

   148.03 CONTRACT COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   All notices to prospective bidders published on behalf of the City shall
include as a part of the contract specifications the condition that all bidders
shall be required to comply with the Streetsboro Equal Employment Opportunity
Program.
   Each bidder shall file as part of bid documents, contract employment reports
with the City. Such contract employment reports shall include such information
as to the employment practices, policies, programs and statistics of the
contractor, and shall be in such form as the City may prescribe. Subcontractors
shall also submit such contract employment reports to the City before approval
by the City as subcontractor.
(Ord. 1998-102. Passed 7-27-98.)
   148.04 PRE-AWARD CONFERENCE.
   Following receipt and review of the employment information submitted by the
bidders, and prior to award of a contract, the apparent successful bidder and

conference, at which time such bidder and major subcontractors shall submit
affirmative action programs to promote equal opportunity in employment.
(Ord. 1998-102. Passed 7-27-98.)
   148.05 PROJECT SITE REPORTS. 
   Where a construction contract exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), a
project site report shall be completed and submitted by the contractor and any
subcontractors not more than ninety (90) days from the beginning of work on the
site. Such project site report shall include such information as to employment
practices and statistics of the contractor and each subcontractor, and shall be
in such form as the City may prescribe. Where the term of the contract exceeds
ninety (90) days, such project site report shall be submitted once each ninety
(90) days, or more frequently if the City determines that such submittal is
deemed necessary for a continuing evaluation of the work force composition.
Subcontractors shall complete and submit such project site reports to the
contractor for transmittal to the City.

compliance.
(Ord. 1998-102. Passed 7-27-98.)
   148.06 INTERGOVERNMENTAL COOPERATION.
    (a)    In the event a contractor fails to cooperate in reaching mutually
satisfactory solutions or to implement contract compliance agreements
previously made, the City shall review such cases to determine:
       (1)    Whether further efforts or alternative approaches are desirable.
Depending upon the nature of the problem, such alternatives may involve contact
with industry, related labor unions, or requesting the assistance of the Ohio
Civil Rights Commission or the Office of Federal Contract Compliance and the
particular federal agency involved for further negotiations; or
       (2)    Whether any of the penalties set forth in Section
148.02(g) is appropriate to the case.
   (b)    In the event the City determines that the contractor has violated or
has failed to comply with the equal employment opportunity requirements of the
contract after affording such contractor a reasonable time to correct his
situation and where negotiations have been of no avail, he shall make a finding
under subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) hereof and shall transmit such finding and
recommendation thereon to the Mayor.
(Ord. 1998-102. Passed 7-27-98.)
   148.07  SEVERABILITY.
   Each part of this policy is hereby declared to be independent sections and
parts of sections and not withstanding any other evidence of legislative
intent, it is hereby declared to be the controlling legislative intent that if
any provision of such sections, or the application thereof to any person or
circumstance, is held invalid, the remaining sections or parts of sections, and
the application of such provision to any person or circumstances, other than
those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby, and it is
hereby declared that the provisions of this chapter would have been passed
independently of such section, sections or part of a section so held to be
invalid.
(Ord. 1998-102. Passed 7-27-98.)
 
   148.08 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM. 
   (a)    The City does hereby reaffirm its policy to insure equal opportunity
employment for all persons to prohibit discrimination in employment because of
race, religion, color, creed, age, sex, ancestry, handicap, marital status or
national origin and to promote the full realization of equal employment
opportunity.
   (b)    The City, as evidence of its intent to comply with basic policies and
procedures necessary for effective, uniform and judicious enforcement of equal
employment opportunity standards, does hereby adopt the affirmative action
program as set forth herein.
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAM
Affirmative Action Discussed
   The term "affirmative action" can best be understood in relation to the
phrase "equal employment opportunity". Equal employment opportunity is a
condition and affirmative action is the means by which the condition is
achieved.
   Affirmative action thus includes all the appropriate methods through which
equal employment opportunity for minority group citizens is made a reality.
Underlying the concept of affirmative action is the recognition that positive
action is required both to insure against discrimination in employment and to
remedy the negative effects of past employment practices.

   167.10 ADDITIONAL CREDIT IN PROMOTIONAL EXAMINATIONS.
   (a)    Vacancies in positions in the competitive classified service shall be

be filed with the Commission forthwith.
   (b)    Any such employee so removed may appeal from the decision of such
appointing authority to the Civil Service Commission, within ten days from and
after the date of such removal, in which event the Commission shall forthwith
notify the appointing authority and hear such appeal within thirty days from
and after its filing with the Commission. The Commission may affirm, disaffirm
or modify the judgment of the appointing authority.
   (c)    However, nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent the
abolition by ordinance of Council of any office or position or the reduction of
the number of employees in any department. Whenever Council orders such
abolition or reduction the appointing authority may summarily remove the
employee in the position so abolished or remove such number of employees in the
inverse order of their appointment as may be necessary to accomplish such
reduction. Upon removal for the purposes of reduction as aforesaid the names of
the persons shall be placed by the Commission at the head of the eligibility
list for such position without examination and shall be certified to the
appointing authority to fill any subsequent vacancy therein.

examination, priority in the time of filing the application with the Commission
shall determine the order in which their names shall be placed on the list for

(Ord. 1972-9. Passed 3-28-72.)
   181.0701 METHOD OF DETERMINATION.
   In the taxation of income which is subject to City income taxes, if the
books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession both within
and without the boundaries of the City disclose with reasonable accuracy what
portion of its net profit is attributable to that part of the business or
profession conducted within the boundaries of the City, then only such portion
shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the City for the purpose of
Municipal income taxation. The portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer
to be allocated as having been derived from within the City, in absence of
actual records thereof, shall be determined as follows:
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight, as follows:
   (a)    The average net book value of the real and tangible personal property
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the City, during
the taxable period to the average net book value of all real and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
during the same period, wherever situated.
      As used in the preceding paragraph, real property includes property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
   (b)    Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable period
to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed in the
City to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same period to
persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their services are
performed.
   (c)    Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
      In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result.
(Ord. 1968-32. Passed 12-27-68.)
   181.0702  SALES MADE IN THE CITY.
   As used in Section
181.0701(c) "sales made in the City" means:
   (a)    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
City regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a stock of
goods within the City.
   (b)    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
City regardless of where title passes even though transported from a point
outside the City if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees
in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the sales result
from such solicitation or promotion.
   (c)    All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place
within the City to purchasers outside of the City regardless of where title
passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in
the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (Ord. 1968-32. Passed 12-27-68.)
   181.0703 TOTAL ALLOCATION. 
   Add together the percentages determined in accordance with Section
181.0701(a), (b) and (c), or such of the aforesaid percentages as are
applicable to the particular taxpayer and divide the total so obtained by the
number of percentages used in deriving the total in order to obtain the
business allocation percentage referred to in Section
181.0701.
   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside the City. (Ord. 1968-32. Passed 12-27-68.)
   181.0704  RENTAL INCOME.
   (a)   Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities under Section
181.0501(c), (e) and (g), only if and to the extent that the rental, ownership,
management or operations of the real estate from which such rentals are
derived, whether so rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or
through agents or other representatives, constitutes a business activity of the
taxpayer in whole or in part.
   (b)   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties
regardless of number and value, aggregates in excess of two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management or operation of such properties is a business activity of
such taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to
tax. However, in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or
fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month. It is provided further that in the case of farm property, the owner
shall be considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in crops or
when the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived
from the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per month; and provided further that the person who operates
a licensed rooming house shall be considered in business whether or not the
gross income exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month.
   (c)   Every property owner who is taxed subject to this Section
181.0704 shall personally or through a management agent submit a list to the
Tax Administrator of the names and addresses of all persons, firms,
corporations or other entities occupying, leasing, renting, or otherwise using
the premises, or any part thereof, within the City in such a manner as to
produce economic benefit to the property owner, whether such benefit is
referred to as “rent” and whether such benefit results in a profit or loss. The
list shall be prepared as of December 31st of the following year and at such
other times as may be prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. 2004-78. Passed 4-26-04.)
   181.0705 OPERATING LOSS CARRY FORWARD.
   (a)    The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to January 1, 1969, allocable to the City, may be applied against
the portion of the profit of succeeding tax years allocable to the City until
exhausted but in no event for more than five taxable years immediately
following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating
loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
   (b)    The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to the
City in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to the
City.
   (c)    The Administrator shall provide by rules and regulations the manner
in which such net operating loss-carry forward shall be determined.
(Ord. 1968-32. Passed 12-27-68.)

employer.

employer actually remits the tax to this Municipality for purposes of

interest and penalty, jointly and severally, for failure to file the employer's
return or to pay the employer's tax, interest and penalty as required under

failure to remit funds held in trust, to file a tax return or to pay taxes.

   (A)    For residents of Streetsboro, the income tax levied herein shall be
on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This

the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.

of Streetsboro for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.

As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in Streetsboro to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during

         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales

         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in

182.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer

income tax ordinance. When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1)
of this section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this
section, the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios

or the Tax Administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to
all or a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment
method as described in division (F). However, the Tax Administrator shall not

withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City of Streetsboro. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and City as the return required
of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this
chapter/ordinance is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter/ordinance or by the employer's, agent's, or
other payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the City the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to City
income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the deferred
compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred
compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City of Streetsboro during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year,;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold City income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter/ordinance, to be tax required to be withheld and
remitted for the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those
two or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair
and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with

section, an employer is not required to withhold City income tax on qualifying
wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in
Streetsboro if the employee performed such services in Streetsboro on twenty
(20) or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions
applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

more than twenty (20) days of the services to complete the services;

requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section

            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in
Streetsboro only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the City than in any other municipal corporation on
that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent
in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City of Streetsboro exceeds the twenty (20)-day
threshold, the employer shall withhold and remit tax to Streetsboro for any
subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the City.
          (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City of
Streetsboro under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax
for the City for the first twenty (20) days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in
Streetsboro.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is Streetsboro and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
182.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to
Streetsboro, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside
the corporate boundaries of the City.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section

individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or

of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio Form

      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of this
section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on
a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.

day of the taxable year to which the return relates. The extended due date of
the City of Streetsboro's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an
individual shall be the fifteenth day of the eleventh month after the last day
of the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file
under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless
the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of Streetsboro's income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-(6) month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a

requested extension.
      (3)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date

the ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of
the City of Streetsboro's income tax return. The extended due date of City
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state

      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.

section, the City of Streetsboro shall reimburse the taxpayer for any
reasonable costs incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to one
hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
         (c)    Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the Tax Administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2)(a) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.

provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to Streetsboro income tax for a
taxable year if both the following apply:

for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 4(C)(1)(g)) within
Streetsboro.
            (ii)    The person no longer provides services in Streetsboro and
does not expect to be subject to Streetsboro's income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within Streetsboro. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within Streetsboro,
make any sales in Streetsboro, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by
the City of Streetsboro during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the City of Streetsboro for the taxable year, the
affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer
with the Streetsboro's income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The
person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)

change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.

of an employer, or other payer as described in Section

other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the City of Streetsboro to be filed in
accordance with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check
to authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the
return, to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to
the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the City
of Streetsboro or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax
return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions

States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City of

   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or

which to make any payment of taxes required by the City in accordance with this
Chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this
section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that the
taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this division,
"qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member of a

taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to City of
Streetsboro's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of

tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to

Revised Code is binding upon the City's Tax Administrator for the remainder of
the five-year period.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to City of Streetsboro. A taxpayer that is required to file a
consolidated City income tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated City income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless

   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
182.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated City of Streetsboro income
tax return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
 182.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
       (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to

Section
182.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Streetsboro. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to City
of Streetsboro;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to City of Streetsboro
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter/
ordinance on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated City income tax return shall make
the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
182.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the City in accordance with this Chapter/ordinance
on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member
for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an
affiliated group.
 
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City of Streetsboro before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with the City may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016. (Ord. 2024-

   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the City of Streetsboro who is
required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter/
ordinance may claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the
tax paid to the other municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section,

grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is

the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after

      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
182.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
182.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve (12) months and the taxpayer filed a return
with the City of Streetsboro under Section
182.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Streetsboro but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that

Tax Administrator within three (3) years after the tax was due or paid,
whichever is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file
with the request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for
a refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (C)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing

days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in Section
182.18(A)(4).

tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income
or wages.
   (C)    If Streetsboro's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City's tax rate. However, if Streetsboro's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to Streetsboro, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.

or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
Streetsboro. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal

prosecutions under Section
 182.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period

that division. If the amount of the refund is in accordance with the dollars,
no refund need be paid by the City. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
182.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund

state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional City income tax
shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax
or overpayment is less than ten dollars.

holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.

   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the

the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Streetsboro does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided

 182.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
182.09.

entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 2024-86.
Passed 5-20-24.)
   182.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    “Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within sixty (60) days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other City official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within sixty (60) days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal
documents, or conducting business at the address; or if, before that time, the
person had conducted business at the address and, when the assessment was
mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate was conducting business at
the address. For the purposes of this section, a person's affiliate is any
other person that, at the time the assessment was mailed, owned or controlled
at least twenty percent (20%), as determined by voting rights, of the
addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
(60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local Board of Tax Review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this Section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2024-86. Passed 5-20-24.)
   182.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City of Streetsboro that arises pursuant to the City's income tax
imposed in accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the City of
Streetsboro:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2024-86. Passed 5-20-24.)
   182.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City of
Streetsboro as authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee
thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this
Chapter and other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the
State Tax Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the City from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2024-86. Passed 5-20-24.)
   182.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City of Streetsboro ordinance
or state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the City or the Tax Administrator.

         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to City of Streetsboro on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
Chapter
181 of the City of Streetsboro Codified Ordinances.
   (C)    Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

   182.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
   (A)   Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the ORC:
       (1)   (a)    Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as
provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the

of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under
Streetsboro's income tax ordinance;
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and

for the income tax levied by the City of Streetsboro or for the withholding of
such tax.

affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this chapter/ordinance prohibits the Tax
Administrator from requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax
Administrator to provide identifying information, which may include the
person's social security number, federal employer identification number, or
other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A person
required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information that has
experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify the Tax
Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax document
requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty (30) days of making the request, nothing in this
chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person
to whom the request was directed pursuant to Section
182.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
 182.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
182.19 within thirty (30) days after filing the next tax document requiring
such identifying information, nothing in this chapter/ordinance prohibits the
Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99 for a violation of Section
182.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law. (Ord. 2024-86. Passed 5-20-24.)

transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (D)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.

with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
    (F)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal. (Ord. 2024-86. Passed 5-20-24.)

member appointed by the Mayor shall serve at the discretion of the Mayor.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by Council may be
removed by the majority vote of City Council for malfeasance, misfeasance, or
nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member, Council must give the member a
copy of the charges against the member and afford the member an opportunity to
be publicly heard in person or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not
less than ten (10) days' notice. The decision by the legislative authority on

as the original appointment within sixty (60) days of when the vacancy was
created. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the

hold office for the remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax
Review shall impair the power and authority of the remaining members to
exercise all the powers of the Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within sixty (60) days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within
sixty (60) days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at
law, certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax
Review may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties.
In such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within ninety (90) days
after the Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of
its final determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal
within fifteen (15) days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or
the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination
as provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.
(Ord. 2024-86. Passed 5-20-24.)
   182.22 AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Nothing in this Chapter prohibits Council, or a Tax Administrator
pursuant to authority granted to the Tax Administrator by resolution or
ordinance, to adopt rules to administer an income tax imposed by the City of

or be inconsistent with any provision of this chapter/ordinance. Taxpayers are

and if, created.
(Ord. 1998-58. Passed 4-27-98.)
   187.03 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Motel” means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for the accommodation
of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or several structures.
   (b)    "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
   (c)    "Vendor" means the person who is the owner or operator of the motel
or transient accommodation and who furnishes the lodging.
   (d)    "Transient accommodation" means every establishment kept, used,

      (Ord. 1974-45. Passed 6-17-74.)
   187.04  EXEMPTIONS; CERTIFICATE.

constitution or laws of Ohio or the United States;
   (b)    Upon rents paid by the State or any of its political subdivisions;
   (c)    Upon rents paid for the use or possession or right to use or possess

   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt under subsections (a) or (b)

   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest to the

(Ord. 1974-45. Passed 6-17-74.)
   187.07  REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE; CONTENTS.
   Within thirty days after the effective date of this chapter or within thirty

      (Ord. 1974-45. Passed 6-17-74.)
   187.08 FILING RETURNS; DISCOUNT; CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF INFORMATION.
   By the 22nd day of each month, each vendor shall file a return with the
Finance Director, on forms provided by the Finance Director, of the total
amounts charged and received and the amount of tax collected for motel or

the vendor shall remit to the Finance Director the full amount of the tax
collected. The Finance Director may require further information in the return
if such information is pertinent to the collection of the tax. Returns and
payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All
taxes collected by vendors pursuant to this Chapter shall be held in trust for
the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the Finance Director.
All returns and payments submitted by each vendor shall be treated as
confidential by the Finance Director and shall not be released by the Finance
Director except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an
officer or agent of the United States, the State, the County or the City for
official use only.
(Ord. 2004-25. Passed 2-23-04.)
   187.09 PENALTY ON LATE RETURNS AND LATE REMITTED TAXES.
   Any vendor who fails to file a return by the 22nd day of each month as
required in Section
187.08 of this Chapter shall pay a one-time penalty of $500.00, to be paid with
the remittance of the tax. Any vendor who fails to remit any tax imposed by
this Chapter by the 22nd day of each month as required in Section
187.08 of this Chapter shall pay a penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the
amount of the tax, in addition to the tax. In addition such penalty, any vendor
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this Chapter within such time shall pay
interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, or fraction thereof, on
the amount of tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the
remittance first became delinquent until fully paid. No penalty provided under
the terms of this Chapter shall be imposed during the pendency of any hearing
provided for in Section
187.10, nor during the pendency of any appeal to the Mayor provided for in
Section
187.11.
(Ord. 2004-25. Passed 2-23-04.)
   187.10 ASSESSMENTS BY FINANCE DIRECTOR; HEARING. 
   If any vendor fails or refuses to collect such tax and to make, within the
time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Finance Director shall proceed in
such manner as she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to
base her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Finance Director procures such
facts and information as she is able to obtain upon which to base the
assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any vendor who has
failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance,
she shall proceed to determine and assess against such vendor the tax, interest
and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made,
the Finance Director shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving
it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the vendor so assessed at his last known place of address. Such
vendor may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make
application in writing to the Finance Director for a hearing on the amount
assessed. If application by the vendor for a hearing is not made within the
time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the
Finance Director, shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and
payable. If such application is made, the Finance Director shall give not less
than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the vendor to
show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why such amount specified
therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such
hearing, the vendor may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax,
interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Finance
Director shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter
give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such
determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount
determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is
taken as provided in Section
187.11.
(Ord. 1974-45. Passed 6-17-74.)
   187.11 APPEALS.
   Any vendor aggrieved by any decision of the Finance Director with respect to
the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the Mayor
by filing a notice of appeal with him within fifteen days of the serving or
mailing of the determination of tax due. The Mayor shall fix a time and place
for hearing such appeal, and shall give notice in writing to such vendor at his
last known place of address. The findings of the Mayor shall be final and
conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed
above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be
immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. (Ord. 1974-45. Passed
6-17-74.)
   187.12  RECORDS; INSPECTION.
   Every vendor liable for the collection and payment to the City of any tax
imposed by this chapter shall keep and preserve, for a period of three years,
all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may
have been liable for the collection of and payment to the City, which records
the Finance Director shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.
(Ord. 1974-45. Passed 6-17-74.)
   187.13  OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)    Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
subsections (b) and (c) hereof, provided a claim in writing therefor, stating
under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded,
is filed with the Finance Director within three years of the date of payment.
The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Finance Director.
   (b)    A vendor may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected
and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or
illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed
by the Finance Director that the person from whom the tax has been collected
was not a transient guest. However, neither a refund nor a credit shall be
allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to
the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient
to the vendor.
   (c)    A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by
filing of a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) hereof, but only
when the tax was paid by the transient guest directly to the Finance Director,
or when the transient guest having paid the tax to the vendor, establishes to
the satisfaction of the Finance Director that the transient guest has been
unable to obtain a refund from the vendor who collected the tax.
   (d)    No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.
(Ord. 1974-45. Passed 6-17-74.)
   187.14  IMPOSITION OF A TAX LIEN.
   In the event any vendor fails to pay the required tax imposed by this
chapter, after exhaustion of any and all appeals allowed by this chapter, the

Auditor for placement upon the tax duplicate as a lien against the real
property upon which the motel, hotel or other facility is situated and the
personal property located therein.

payments to the City for the disbursement quarter (as contemplated under

   (c)   The Finance Director may provide such other information to the
Visitors and Convention Bureau as he or she deems appropriate and not in

required herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or
refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the Finance
Director, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty of a
misdemeanor, and is punishable as aforesaid. Any person required to make,

shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to

removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the person
from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it has
been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency

certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the

the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the

municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.

to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a

than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.

   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this

(ORC 4511.12)
   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection

   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.

flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified

thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.

violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the court
may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the
offender to a jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days
that the offender does not spend attending the program. The court may require
the offender, as a condition of community control and in addition to the
required attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, to attend and
satisfactorily complete any treatment or education programs that comply with
the minimum standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the
Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the
drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender should attend and to
report periodically to the court on the offender’s progress in the programs.
The court also may impose on the offender any other conditions of community
control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the
required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that the operators of the
drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender should attend and to
report periodically to the court on the offender’s progress in the programs.
The court also may impose any other conditions of community control on the
offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. (ORC 4511.19)
            5.   In all cases, if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s
name, immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense for ninety days in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233 and impoundment of the license plates of
that vehicle for ninety days. (ORC 4511.193)
         C.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or other equivalent offenses is guilty of a misdemeanor. The court

subsection (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of thirty consecutive days. The court shall impose the thirty-day
mandatory jail term under this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3)
of this section, it instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting
of both a jail term and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to
the thirty-day mandatory jail term. Notwithstanding the jail terms set forth in
Section
303.99, the additional jail term shall not exceed one year, and the cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed one year.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

section, it instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both
a jail term and a term of electronically monitored house arrest with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the sixty-day
mandatory jail term. Notwithstanding the terms of imprisonment set forth in

felony of the third degree and shall be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
subsection (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver’s or occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section as a result of the conviction or guilty
plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in division (F)(2) of Ohio R.C.
4511.191.
      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may
sentence the offender to five consecutive days in jail and not less than
eighteen consecutive days of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with

consecutively to the period of house arrest.
As an alternative to the mandatory jail term of sixty consecutive days required
by subsection (h)(1)C.2. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended under subsection (h) of
this section and if Ohio R.C. 4510.13 permits the court to grant limited
driving privileges, the court may grant the limited driving privileges in
accordance with that section. If division (A)(7) of that section requires that
the court impose as a condition of the privileges that the offender must
display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in division (B) of Ohio R.C. 4503.231.
      (5)   If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order of criminal
forfeiture under this section is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or
(3) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other
penalty established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the
vehicle as determined by publications of the national auto dealers association.
The proceeds of any fine so imposed shall be distributed in accordance with
division (C)(2) of that section.
      (6)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under subsection (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

other penalties provided by law, may order restitution pursuant to Ohio R.C.
2929.18 or 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000)
for any economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct

under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it

section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

thereon, or when such streets and highways would be damaged or destroyed by
heavy traffic during the period of thawing or excessive moisture, the maximum
weight of vehicle and load, or the maximum speed, or both, for motor vehicles

such reduction as the condition of the road or highway justifies, but in no
case shall the reduction be more than fifty percent (50%).
   (c)    The schedule of the reduction of maximum weights and speeds shall be
filed, for the information of the public in the office of the Division of
Police. The Director, at least one day before such reduction becomes effective,
shall cause to be placed and retained on such streets and highways, at both
ends and at the points of intersections by principal roads, during the period
of such reduced limitation of weight, speed or both, signs of substantial
construction, which will conspicuously indicate the limitations of weight and
speed allowed on the street or highway and the date on which such limitations
shall go into effect. No person shall operate upon any such street or highway,
a motor vehicle whose maximum weight or speed is in excess of the limitations
prescribed. The expense of the purchase and erection of signs provided for in

ownership of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor
vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the

(e) of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking
locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed

offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is

case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by

constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,

(ORC 2901.11)
   501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
 
   501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
   501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)    If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth. "
   (e)    It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a

whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,

high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.

   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or

a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:

pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.

         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug

   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
   A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred eighty
days;
   B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
   C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
   D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                     Maximum Fine
First degree                            $5000.00
Second degree                           4000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified 2000.00

classified
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this

   541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON. 
   (a)    The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)    If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item,
antique, museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is
either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial
time, effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)    If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(l) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)    If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(l) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)    As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law. (ORC 2909.03)
   541.03 CRIMINAL DAMAGING OR ENDANGERING.
   (a)   No person shall cause, or create a substantial risk of physical harm

      (1)   Knowingly, by any means;
      (2)   Recklessly, by means of fire, explosion, flood, poison gas, poison,
radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or
endangering, a misdemeanor of the second degree. If violation of this section
creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an

545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

reconciliation.
   (g)   If the parties cannot agree upon an amicable solution to the problem,
the complaint, together with any recommendation thereon, shall be transmitted

dismissal of the complaint, suspension of the license and assessment of penalty
fees, or revocation of the license.

   (x)   "Supplementary application" means an application made to excavate or
obstruct more of the right-of-way than allowed in, or to extend, a permit that
had already been issued.
   (y)   "Technically necessary" means, with respect to the installation of
facilities and equipment, that the services to be provided through such
facilities and equipment cannot, for sound engineering reasons, be provided
unless the facilities are sited in the public right-of-way. The need to pay
private property owners for siting locations does not give rise to a technical
necessity to site facilities and equipment in the public right-of-way.
   (z)   "Facilities and equipment" includes, but is not limited to lines,
poles, wires, cables, pipes, valves, pumps, vaults, pedestals, splice or switch
cabinets, conduits, ducts, transformers, radio receivers, transmitters,
antennas, cellular telephone towers, small cellular base stations, repeaters,
power supplies, and any other structures, appurtenances, devices or equipment
generally associated with the provision of water, sewer, gas, electric,
telephone, telecommunications or cable television services.
   (aa)    "Universal access" means, with respect to public utility services,
that the services are available to end users in some defined geographic area on
a nondiscriminatory basis at publicly available rates.
      (Ord. 2016-89. Passed 8-8-16.)
   909.02 INITIAL CONSENT.
   Initial consent for occupancy or use of a right-of-way is hereby granted for
all lines, poles, pipes, conduits, ducts, equipment, or other appurtenances,
structures, or facilities of a public utility or cable operator that, on July
2, 2002, lawfully so occupied or used a right-of-way. However, such consent
does not relieve a public utility or cable operator or any other person of
compliance with this chapter with respect to installing any facilities or
equipment in the public right-of-way, obstructing any portion of a public
right-of-way, or excavating in a right-of-way on or after the effective date of
this chapter.
(Ord. 2016-89. Passed 8-8-16.)
   909.03 PERMIT REQUIREMENT.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no person may install
any Facilities or Equipment in the public right-of-way, obstruct any public
right-of-way, or excavate in any public right-of-way without first having
obtained a permit to install, an excavation permit, or an obstruction permit,
respectively, from the City Engineer. Work authorized under a Permit to Install
that also includes excavation or obstruction may be combined by the City
Engineer into a single permit.
   (b)   No person may excavate or obstruct the right-of-way beyond the date or
dates specified in the permit unless such person makes a supplementary
application for another right-of-way permit before the expiration of the
initial permit, or a new permit or permit extension is granted.
   (c)   Permits issued under this chapter shall be conspicuously displayed at
all times at the indicated work site and shall be available for inspection by
the City Engineer.
(Ord. 2016-89. Passed 8-8-16.)
   909.04 PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
      (a)    Application for a permit is to be made to the City Engineer.
Right-of-way permit applications shall contain, and will be considered complete
only upon compliance with, the following requirements:
            (1)    Submission of a completed permit application form, including
all required attachments, and scaled drawings showing the location and area of
the proposed project and the location of all existing and proposed equipment
(unless waived by the City Engineer).
            (2)    Payment of permit fee (and any additional permit review and
construction observation charges as determined by the City Engineer).
             (3)    Deposit of restoration bond (unless not required by the
City Engineer).
   
   (b)    The City Engineer may waive the permit fee if in his or her opinion
the excavation or obstruction proposed under the application does not require
City review or construction observation, to ensure public health, safety, and
welfare as it related to City right-of-way.
(Ord. 2022-75. Passed 5-9-22.)
   909.05 ISSUANCE OF PERMIT; CONDITIONS.
   (a)   If the City Engineer determines that the applicant has satisfied the
requirements of this chapter, the City Engineer may issue a permit, and may
impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of the permit and the
performance of the applicant thereunder to protect the public health, safety,
and welfare, to insure the structural integrity of the right-of-way, to protect
the property and safety of other users of the right-of-way, and to minimize the
disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public. The City Engineer shall
grant or deny a permit within 60 days of the date of receipt of the
application.
   (b)   No permit issued under this Chapter shall be construed to grant the
permittee a vested right to maintain facilities or equipment in any particular
place or space in the right-of-way. In the event permitted facilities or
equipment interfere with the future construction, operation, maintenance, or
repair of any public work or public improvement, the permittee, after
reasonable notice from the City, shall, at its own cost and expense, promptly
protect, alter or relocate the affected facilities or equipment to another
location in the right-of-way approved by the City Engineer.
   (c)   All permits to install issued under this Chapter shall be issued in
the name of the owner of the facilities or equipment to be installed, and shall
not be construed to authorize the installation of facilities or equipment by a
person or entity other than the owner. All permits shall require the permittee
to provide and maintain legally sufficient owner contact information so that
the owner may be contacted throughout the project and/or for the duration of
the life span of the facilities or equipment installed.
   (d)   All permits issued under this Chapter shall be nontransferable except
with the express written consent of the City Engineer which, in the case of a
public utility or cable operator, shall not be unreasonably withheld when the
Public Utilities Commission of Ohio or the Department of Commerce, as
indicated, has approved a transfer or change in corporate ownership.
   (e)   All permits issued under this Chapter shall require that the
facilities and equipment installed will be maintained in compliance with the
National Electrical Safety Code or other safety codes legally applicable to
outdoor powered equipment, for the duration of the life span of the facilities
or equipment installed.
   (f)   All permits issued under this Chapter shall provide that any
facilities or equipment in the public right-of-way that the City has determined
to be abandoned may be summarily removed in accordance with the procedure
provided in Section
909.13(c).
(Ord. 2016-89. Passed 8-8-16.)
   909.06 PERMIT FEES.
   (a)   The permit application fee for any public right of way shall be as
follows:
                (1)   Single Parcel impacts with frontage less than 101 feet:
$150.00
      (2)   Single Parcel impacts with frontage from 101 to 300 feet: $300.00
      (3)   Linear projects impacting greater than 301 feet or multiple
parcels: $300 plus $0.35 per linear foot of impacted right of way after the
initial 301 linear feet, but not exceeding a total permit fee of $800.00.
   (b)   Fees for construction observation of the right-of-way permit work
shall be assessed in accordance with Section
149.11(i)(5) of the Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 2022-169. Passed 11-28-22.)
   909.07 RIGHT-OF-WAY RESTORATION.
   (a)   The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the repair and
restoration of the right-of-way as required, must be completed within the dates
specified in the permit, increased by as many days as work could not be done
because of circumstances beyond the control of permittee or when work was
prohibited as unseasonable; and in addition to repairing its own work, the
permittee must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas,
including the paving and its foundations, to the same condition that existed
before the commencement of the work and must inspect the area of the work and
use reasonable care to maintain the same condition for one (1) year thereafter.
The permittee may be required to post a restoration bond if, and in an amount,
determined by the City Engineer to be sufficient to cover the cost of restoring
the right-of-way to its pre-excavation condition. If, one year after completion
of the restoration of the right-of-way, the City Engineer determines that the
right-of-way has been properly restored, the surety on the bond shall be
released. The permittee shall perform repairs and restorations according to the
standards and with the materials specified by the City Engineer. The City
Engineer shall have the authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the
restoration, and may do so in written procedures of general application or on a
case-by-case basis. The City Engineer in exercising this authority shall be
guided by the following standards and considerations:
      (1)   The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the right-of-way.
      (2)    The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way.
      (3)    The character of the neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way;
the pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way.
      (4)    The remaining life-expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the
excavation.
      (5)    Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the
permittee is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated
depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise result from the
excavation, disturbance or damage to the right-of-way.
      (6)    The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be
effective in slowing the depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise
take place.
   (b)   Methods of restoration may include, but are not limited to, patching,
replacement of the right-of-way base, and milling and overlay of the entire
area of the right-of-way affected by the work. The permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for one year following its completion. During this
one-year period, the permittee shall, upon notification from the City Engineer,
correct all restoration work to the extent necessary using the method required
by the City Engineer. Such work shall be completed within five (5) calendar
days of the receipt of the notice from the City Engineer, not including days
during which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force
majeure or days when work was prohibited as unseasonable. If the permittee
fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required
by the City Engineer, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all
repairs required by the City Engineer, the City Engineer, at his or her option,
may do such work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the City, within
thirty (30) days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way or the City
may exercise on the restoration bond.
(Ord. 2003-53. Passed 3-24-03.)
   909.08 SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS.
   A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area of the right-of-way
specified in the permit. No permittee may perform any work outside the area
specified in the permit, except as provided in this chapter. Any permittee that
determines that an area greater than that specified in the permit must be
obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area make
application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees necessitated
thereby, and be granted a new permit or permit extension. A right-of-way permit
is valid only for the dates specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its
work before the permit start date or, except as provided in this chapter,
continue working after the end date. If a permittee does not finish the work by
the permit end date, it must make application for a new permit for the
additional time it needs, and receive the new permit or an extension of the old
permit before working after the end date of the previous permit. This
supplementary application must be done before the permit end date.
(Ord. 2003-53. Passed 3-24-03.)
   909.09 OTHER OBLIGATIONS.
   Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not relieve a permittee of its duty to
obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all fees
required by any other city, county, state, or federal rules, laws or
regulations. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of local, state and
federal laws, including Ohio statutes, particularly Ohio R.C. Chapter 4939. A
permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and
established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the
right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who performs the work.
Except in the case of an emergency, and with the approval of the City Engineer,
no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when seasonally
prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work. A permittee shall
not so obstruct a right-of-way that the natural free and clear passage of water
through the gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. Private
vehicles may not be parked with or adjacent to a permit area. The loading or
unloading of trucks adjacent to a permit area is prohibited unless specifically
authorized by the permit.
(Ord. 2003-53. Passed 3-24-03.)
   909.10 DENIAL OF PERMIT.
   (a)   Unless the Applicant has obtained the consent of City Council by
ordinance to occupy or use the public right-of-way and the permit application
is consistent with the rights granted in such consent:
      (1)   The City Engineer shall not grant a Permit to Install to any person
or entity that is not a Public Utility or a Cable Operator as defined in this
Chapter.
      (2)   The City Engineer shall not grant a Permit to Install to any person
or entity when installation of the identified Facilities or Equipment in the
public right-of-way is not technically necessary to provide the services
proposed.
      (3)   The City Engineer shall not grant a Permit to Install to any person
or entity that does not provide or intend to provide Public Utility Services as
defined in this Chapter, or cable services as defined in Ohio R.C. 4939.01(A).
   (b)   The City Engineer may deny a permit to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of
ordinary travel over the right-of-way, or when necessary to protect the right-
of-way and its users. The City Engineer, in her or his discretion, may consider
one or more of the following factors:
      (1)    The extent to which right-of-way space where the permit is sought
is available.
      (2)    The competing demands for the particular space in the right-of-
way.
      (3)    The availability of other locations in the right-of-way, on
private property, or in other rights- of-way for the equipment of the
particular company.
      (4)    The applicability of ordinance or other regulations of the right-
of-way that affect location of equipment in the right-of-way including, but not
limited to any underground utility district established by ordinance.
      (5)    The degree of compliance of the applicant with the terms and
conditions of its franchise, this chapter, and other applicable ordinances and
regulations.
      (6)    The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and businesses
that will result from the use of that part of the right-of-way, including
potential damage to viewsheds or other aesthetic concerns of adjacent property
owners.
      (7)    The condition and age of the right-of-way, and whether and when it
is scheduled for total or partial reconstruction.
      (8)    The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage
to the right-of-way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by
the expansion into additional parts of the right-of-way.
      (9)   Any established City policy to consolidate facilities where
possible, including any Applicant's prior failure to comply with pole
consolidation policies of the City.
   (c)    The City Engineer shall not deny a permit to a public utility as
defined in this Chapter, or to a cable operator that possesses a valid
franchise awarded pursuant to the "Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984" (98
Stat. 2779, 47 U.S.C.A. 541), based on a failure to possess the financial,
technical, or managerial resources necessary to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare. However, a Permit to Install requested by these entities
may be denied for the reasons set forth in subsections (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this
Section.
   (d)   If a permit is denied, the City Engineer shall provide to the
applicant in writing his or her reasons for denying the permit and such
information as the applicant may reasonably request to obtain a permit.
(Ord. 2016-89. Passed 8-8-16.)
   909.11 INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS.
   The excavation, backfilling, restoration, and all other work performed in
the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with specifications as
promulgated by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 2003-53. Passed 3-24-03.)
   909.12 INSPECTION.
   When the work under any permit is completed, the permittee shall notify the
City Engineer. A permittee shall make the work site available to the City
Engineer and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the work. At the
time of inspection, the City Engineer may order the immediate cessation of any
work that poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety or well-being of
the public. The City Engineer may issue an order to the permittee for any work
that does not conform to the applicable standards, conditions, or codes, which
states that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of
the permit. Within ten (10) days after issuance of the order, the permittee
shall present proof to the City Engineer that the violation has been corrected.
If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the City
Engineer may revoke the permit pursuant to Section
909.14.
(Ord. 2003-53. Passed 3-24-03.)
 
   909.13 WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (a)   Emergency Situations. Each person shall immediately notify the City
Engineer of any event regarding its equipment that it considers to be an
emergency. The person may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to
respond to the emergency. Within two (2) business days after the occurrence of
the emergency, the person shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees
associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to
bring itself into compliance with this chapter for the actions it took in
response to the emergency.
   (b)   Non-Emergency Situations. Except in the case of an emergency, any
person who obstructs or excavates a right-of-way without a permit (unless
waived by the City Engineer) must subsequently obtain a permit, pay double the
normal fee for such permit, and deposit with the City Engineer the fees
necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way.
   (c)   Any facilities or equipment installed without a valid Permit to
Install issued under this Chapter and without benefit of the initial consent
granted under Section
909.02 hereof may be summarily removed from the right-of-way upon direction of
the City Engineer. Prior to causing the removal of non-permitted facilities or
equipment, the City Engineer shall provide the owner of such facilities or
equipment, if known, with thirty (30) days' notice to remove the facilities or
equipment. The City Engineer may provide fewer than thirty (30) days' notice in
an emergency situation or if the presence of the non-permitted facilities or
equipment threatens to delay a public works project. If the owner fails to
remove said facilities or equipment within the time provided, the City Engineer
may proceed to remove the facilities or equipment at the owner's risk. An owner
having received a notice under this Section and who fails to comply shall
reimburse the City for all expenses incurred in removing the facilities and
equipment and restoring the right-of-way to its previous condition.
(Ord. 2016-89. Passed 8-8-16.)
   909.14 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (a)   A permittee holds permits issued pursuant to this chapter as a
privilege and not as a right. The City reserves its right to revoke any right-
of-way permit, without fee refund, in the event of a substantial breach of the
terms and conditions of this chapter or any statute, ordinance, rule, or
regulation, or any condition of the permit. A substantial breach by a permittee
shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
      (l)    The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way
permit;
      (2)    An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the
right-of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or
deceit upon the City or its citizens;
      (3)    Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
right-of-way permit;
      (4)    The failure to maintain the required bonds and/or insurance;
      (5)    The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; or
      (6)    The failure to correct a condition indicated on an order issued
pursuant to Section
909.12.
   (b)   If the City Engineer determines that the permittee has committed a
substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule,
regulation or any condition of the permit, the City Engineer shall make a
written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit.
Further, a substantial breach will allow the City Engineer, at his or her
discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit. Within
twenty-four (24) hours of receiving notification of the breach, permittee shall
contact the City Engineer with a plan, acceptable to the City Engineer, for its
correction. Failure to so contact the City Engineer, or failure to submit an
acceptable plan, or failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be
cause for immediate revocation of the permit. If a permit is revoked, any
facilities and/or equipment installed pursuant to said permit shall be promptly
and permanently removed from the right-of-way upon order of the City Engineer,
and the permittee shall also restore the right-of-way to its original condition
or reimburse the City for its reasonable costs of restoration and any other
costs incurred by the City in connection with such revocation. If a permittee
fails to comply with an order to remove facilities and equipment issued under
this Section, the City may summarily remove such facilities in accordance with
the procedure set forth in Section
909.13(c).
(Ord. 2016-89. Passed 8-8-16.)
   909.15 NONEXCLUSIVE REMEDY.
   The remedies provided in this chapter are not exclusive or in lieu of other
rights and remedies that the City may have at law or in equity. The City is
authorized to seek legal and equitable relief for actual or threatened injury
to the public rights of way, including damages to the rights of way, whether or
not caused by a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or other
provisions of law.

determined by the customer, not to exceed one year, which request may be
renewed by the customer for successive periods of up to one year. While the
water service is voluntarily terminated pursuant to an unexpired request, such
customer shall not incur a minimum water bill. The Director shall charge the
customer the City's cost to provide such service, plus an administrative fee

where necessary in an emergency situation such as fire, flood, storm damage or
natural disaster, to permit repair of a service connection, to prevent
contamination and/or loss of product due to tampering or noncompliance with
plumbing codes or regulations, and to prevent loss of product as a result of
damage to, or failure to maintain a service connection. The Director shall give
as much advance notice to the customer as reasonably possible under the
circumstances, and where no advance notice is given, the premises shall be
posted with a notice of the termination, and the Director shall forthwith
provide a post-termination notice by mail to the customer, to any other person
who has requested to receive duplicate bills associated with that premises, and
to any other known interested parties.
   (c)   The Director is authorized to terminate service to any premises
regardless of the delinquency status of the account, if it appears that the

property damage and/or loss of product due to freezing water pipes and
flooding, or other condition of disrepair. Prior to conducting a termination of
service under this subsection, the Director shall provide thirty (30) days
written notice by certified and regular mail to the owner/account holder, to

(Ord. 2022-10. Passed 1-10-22.)
   927.03  SURVEY AND INVESTIGATIONS.
   (a)   The supplier of water shall conduct or cause to be conducted an
initial assessment and periodic surveys or investigations of water use
practices within a consumer's premises to determine whether there are actual or
potential cross-connections to the consumer's water system through which
contaminants or pollutants could backflow into the public water system or
determine where in the judgment of the supplier of water, a pollutional system,
health or severe health hazard to the public water system exists.
   To meet this requirement, the supplier of water shall conduct or cause to be
conducted an on-site investigation of all premises at least every five years to
identify changes in water use practices at the consumer's property so that new
or increased hazards to the water supply are identified and mitigated.
      (1)   In lieu of conducting an on-site investigation of all premises
every five years, the supplier of water can document, in writing, an alternate,
on-going, methodology to identify changes in water use practices that may
represent a new or increased hazard to the public water supply. An on-site
investigation is required when a potential new or increased hazard is suspected
to confirm the degree of risk and how it will be addressed. Information
obtained through a water use survey questionnaire or in coordination with the
local building, zoning, health, fire protection and other licensing agencies
may be used as an indicator of when an on-site investigation should be
conducted. Other triggers, such as a request to the supplier of water for a new
or additional service line, or an additional or larger meter should warrant an
on-site investigation.
      (2)   In lieu of conducting an on-site investigation of each residential
premise, the supplier of water may institute an on-going educational campaign
to inform consumers of common backflow hazards created during residential water
use and provide a reporting mechanism for suspected cross-connections. An
education campaign may use local media and advertising resources, but must also
include information delivered, either electronically or hard copy, to each
residential service connection at least annually.
   (b)   The supplier of water, or the supplier's authorized representative,
shall have the right to enter premises served by the public water system at all
reasonable times for the purpose of making surveys and investigations of water
use practices within the premises.
   (c)   On request by the supplier of water, or the supplier's authorized
representative, the consumer shall furnish the supplier, or the supplier's
authorized representative, information on water use practices within the
consumer's premises.
   (d)   Paragraph (a) of this rule does not relieve the consumer of the
responsibility for conducting, or causing to be conducted, periodic surveys of
water use practices on his premises to determine whether there are actual or
potential cross-connections in the consumer's water system through which
contaminants or pollutants could backflow into a public water system or a
potable consumer's water system.
(Ord. 2022-10. Passed 1-10-22.)
   927.04 WHERE PROTECTION IS REQUIRED.

pollutional hazard.
   (b)   The type of protection required under Section
927.04 (e) shall be an approved air gap separation or an approved
interchangeable connection. A removable spool piece connection is not an
acceptable method.
   (c)   Where an auxiliary water system is used as a secondary source of water
for a fire protection system, the provisions of subsection (b) hereof, for an
approved air gap separation or an approved interchangeable connection may be
waived by the Director, provided the following conditions exist:
      (1)   At premises where the auxiliary water system may be contaminated
with substances that could cause a system, health or severe health hazard, a
public water system or a consumer's water system shall be protected against
backflow by installation of an approved reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention assembly or an approved reduced pressure principle-detector check
assembly.
      (2)   At all other premises, a public water system or a consumer's water
system shall be protected against backflow by installation of an approved

a public water system or a consumer's water system; and
      (5)   The water in the fire protection system shall be used for fire
protection only, with no other use of water from the fire protection system
downstream from the approved backflow prevention device.
   (d)    An exception to the requirement in paragraph (a) (2) of this section
may be applied when mitigating the health hazard associated with a water-only,
residential-type irrigation system that is not subjected to backpressure and is
not equipped with pumps or other prime movers which can create backpressure to
the public or the consumer's water system. In this instance, an approved
pressure vacuum breaker can be used to isolate the service line to the
irrigation system in lieu of installing a containment assembly at the service
connection. The same maintenance and testing requirements as outlined in rule
for containment assemblies apply. This exception does not apply if an additive
is used within the irrigation system. The supplier of water may determine other
hazards exist that warrant additional containment protection at the service
connection.

   (c)    Filing of an application with the Zoning Inspector or Department of
Planning and Zoning by one or more owners of property within the area proposed
to be changed or affected by the proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance.
However, no such application is to be accepted by the Zoning Inspector or
Department of Planning and Zoning from any person requesting rezoning to any
residential classification in any zoning district within this City, for the
period from February 29, 2003, through November 29, 2004.
      (Ord. 2004-12. Passed 1-26-04.)
   1109.03 CONTENTS OF APPLICATION FOR AMENDMENT TO ZONING ORDINANCE.
   (a)    Application for amendment to the Zoning Ordinance pursuant to Section
1109.02(c) shall first be submitted to the Zoning Inspector for determination
of compliance with Section
1109.03 and application shall be submitted on forms made available by the
Zoning Inspector and shall include the following:
      (1)   Evidence that the proposed amendment would materialize in an equal
or better zoning ordinance than that existing.
      (2)   A statement of the proposed text change in the regulation set forth
in this Zoning Ordinance.
      (3)   A map of the proposed zoning district and geographic boundaries.
      (4)   If application is initiated under Section
1109.02(c), a fee as specified by Section
1107.08 shall be deposited with Zoning Inspector.
      (5)   Evidence that the existing Zoning Ordinance is unreasonable with
respect to the particular property, and that it deprives the property owner of
his lawful and reasonable use of the land. For the purposes of the Zoning
Ordinance a limitation upon the financial gain from the land in question shall
not constitute unreasonable zoning.
      (6)   A list of all current property owners within, contiguous to and
directly across the street and property within 500 feet from the parcel(s)
proposed to be rezoned as well as the addresses of those owners.
      (7)   A statement on how the proposed amendment relates to Streetsboro
policies plan for development.
   Applications to amend parts of this Zoning Ordinance other than the Zoning
District Map, shall include at least items (1), (2) and (7).
(Ord. 1989-51. Passed 8-28-89.)
   (b)   Once an application is complete, including the payment of fees, the
Zoning Inspector shall transmit the following to the Clerk of the City Planning
Commission for placement on the agenda:
      (1)   A copy of the completed application; and
      (2)   A statement certifying the actual number of single family and
multi- family units in the City, and the ratio derived from comparing single
family units to multi-family units. All units that have received the requisite
approval from the City shall be included even though not actually constructed.
(Ord. 1994-74. Passed 7-25-94.)
   (c)   Within three days after the Zoning Inspector receives a satisfactorily
completed application for a change in the zoning map, the Zoning Inspector
shall transmit the application to the Service Director. Within five days of
receiving the application, the Service Director shall post a sign on the
property stating that the property is under consideration for rezoning and to
contact City Hall. The sign shall be 4 feet X 6 feet and shall state the
current zoning and the proposed zoning. The sign shall be setback on the
proposed property according to the Sign Ordinance, but shall be placed where it
is clearly visible to any passersby. The sign shall remain on the site until
the application has been properly disposed of by the Planning Commission and
Council. Failure to meet the timelines, failure to post or failure to maintain
the sign on the property shall not invalidate any action taken on the
application by the Planning Commission or Council.
(Ord. 1997-110. Passed 8-25-97.)
   1109.04  MANDATORY REFERRAL TO PLANNING COMMISSION FOR RECOMMENDATION.

   (a)    The districts and their boundary lines are indicated upon a map
entitled "Zoning Districts Map of the City of Streetsboro, Portage County,
Ohio" which map is part of this Zoning Ordinance. The Zoning Districts Map
together with all notations, references and other matters shown thereon are
hereby declared a part of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)    The original or master of such Zoning Districts Map shall be retained
in City offices, maintained current with amendments and be available to the
public.
(Ord. 1980-20. Passed 1-28-80.)
   1121.04  INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES. 
   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the
aforesaid districts as shown on the Zoning Districts Map, the following rules
shall apply:
   (a)    Where Boundaries Approximately Follow Streets, Alleys or Highways.
Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the center
line or right-of-way lines of streets, the center line or alley line of alleys,
or the center line or right-of-way lines of highways, such lines shall be
construed to be such district boundaries.
   (b)    Where Boundaries Parallel Street Right-of-Way Lines, Alley Lines, or
Highway Right-of-Way Lines. Where district boundaries are so indicated that
they are approximately parallel to the center lines or right-of-way lines of
streets, the center lines or alley lines of alleys, or the centerlines or
right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as
being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the Map.
If no distance is given, such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the
scale shown on the Zoning Map.
   (c)    Where Boundaries Approximately Follow Lot Lines. Where district
boundaries are indicated as approximately following lot lines, such lot lines
shall be construed to be such boundaries.
   (d)    Where Boundaries Do Not Follow or Parallel Street, Alley, Highway or
Lot Lines. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they do not follow
or parallel street, alley, highway, or lot lines, but do connect points
established by the intersection of such lines, such straight lines connecting
such points shall be construed to be the district boundaries. Where district
boundaries are so indicated that they follow topographical features, such lines
shall be construed as following the center line of such features. The location
of such topographical features shall be determined by use of the scale shown on
the Zoning Map.
   (e)    Where Boundaries Follow USGS Contours. Where district boundaries are
indicated by the land below the USGS contour elevation such as the Flood Plain
Area the pool elevation at the original lot line shall be designated on the
zoning map. For the specific location falling between the original lot lines
the local pool elevation shall be calculated using the straight line
interpolation method.
   (f)    Vacation of Public Ways. Whenever any street, alley or public way is
vacated in the manner authorized by law the zoning districts adjoining each
side of the street, alley or public way shall be automatically extended to the
center of such vacations and all areas included in the vacation shall then and
henceforth be subject to all regulations of the extended districts.

   1122.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)    Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of City of Streetsboro, State of Ohio,
does ordain as follows:
   (b)    Findings of Fact. The City of Streetsboro has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)    Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)    Protect human life and health;
      (2)    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and
      (4)    Generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (5)    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (6)    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (7)    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (8)    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (9)    Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (10)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (11)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (12)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (13)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)    Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)    Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)    Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)    Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
      (4)    Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)    Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)    Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Streetsboro as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by City of Streetsboro.
(Ord. 2004-139. Passed 9-27-04.)
   (f)    Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Portage County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Portage County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective August 18, 2009.
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis by a registered
Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio, which has been approved by the City
of Streetsboro as required by Section
1122.05(c).
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Engineering Department, 9184 State Route 43,
Streetsboro, Ohio 44241.
(Ord. 2009-80. Passed 8-10-09.)
   (g)    Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances (resolutions) including subdivision
regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these
regulations and any other ordinance (resolution), the more restrictive shall be
followed. These regulations shall not intend to impair any deed restriction,
covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be
governed by the regulations.
   (h)    Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)    Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)    Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Streetsboro, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)    Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
         (Ord. 2004-139. Passed 9-27-04.)
   1122.03 DEFINITIONS. 
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   Accessory Structure A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   Appeal A request for review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation
of any provision of these regulations or a request for a variance.
   Base Flood The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one- hundred (100) year flood.
   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE) The water surface elevation of the
base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 198S, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   Basement Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   Development Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor  See "Lowest Floor."
   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management) Issued by President Carter in
1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in
or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless
there is no practicable alternative.
   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   Fill A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   Flood or Flooding A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   (1)    The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
   (2)    The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) Usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   Flood Insurance Risk Zones Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are determined.
Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood
depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths
are determined.
Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood
depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are
determined.
Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be
protected from the 100 year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-
year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing
drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   Flood Insurance Study (FIS) The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   Flood Protection Elevation The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the
base flood elevation plus 2 feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood
elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation
can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or
approved by the floodplain administrator.
   Floodway A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   Freeboard A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   Historic structure Any structure that is:
   (1)    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
   (2)    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
   (3)    Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   Letter of Map Change (LOMC) A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA
determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC's are
broken down into the following categories:
   Letter of Man Amendment (LOMA) A revision based on technical data showing
that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard
area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) A revision based on technical data that,
usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations,
floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type
of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel
has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore,
excluded from the special flood hazard area.
   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) A formal review and comment by
FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum National Flood
Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or
revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps,
or Flood Insurance Studies.
   Lowest floor The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   Manufactured home A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   Manufactured home park As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code 3701-27-
01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three or more
manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or
for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle,
or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A
tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or
rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   New construction Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced
on or after the initial effective date of the City of Streetsboro Flood
Insurance Rate Map, December 18 1984, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   Person Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   Recreational vehicle A vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis, (2)
400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, (3)
designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck,
and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   Registered Professional Architect A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to 4703.19 of
the Revised Code.
   Registered Professional Engineer A person registered as a professional
engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   Registered Professional Surveyor A person registered as a professional
surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   Special Flood Hazard Area Also known as "Areas of Special Flood Hazard", it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   Start of construction The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   Structure A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground.
   Substantial Damage Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   Substantial Improvement Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include:
      (1)    Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)    Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   Variance A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   Violation The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations. (Ord. 2004-139. Passed 9-27-04.)

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that City of Streetsboro's flood maps, studies and other data identified
in Section
1122.02(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data. For all development
proposals that impact floodway delineations or base flood elevations, the
community shall ensure that technical data reflecting such changes be submitted
to FEMA within six months of the date such information becomes available. These
development proposals include:
         A.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         B.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         C.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
         D.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section

      (2)    It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with this subsection, prepared in a format required for
a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted
to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall be the
responsibility of the applicant.
      (3)    The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter of
Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
         A.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
         B.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by
more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but
no floodway.
      (4)    Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to paragraph (l)(1)
hereof.
   (m)    Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City of
Streetsboro, and may be submitted at any time.
   (n)    Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City of Streetsboro
have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In order that the City of Streetsboro's
Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Streetsboro
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Streetsboro suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits
or the new area for which the City of Streetsboro has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (o)    Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)    Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)    When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)    The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1122.06, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)    Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (p)    Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including tornado, wind, heavy snow, flood, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)    Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)    Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)    Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

of the following standards:
      (1)    They shall not be located on sites in special flood hazard areas
for more than 180 days, or
      (2)    They must be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
      (3)    They must meet all standards of subsection (d) hereof.
   (h)    Above Ground Gas or Liquid Storage Tanks. All above ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1122.04(l)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of City of Streetsboro and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B.1. and 3. to 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Streetsboro specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
      The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data in
Section
1122.04(l)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 2004-139. Passed 9-27-04.)
   1122.06 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)    Appeals Board Established.
      (l)    The City Council of the City of Streetsboro shall appoint an
Appeals Board consisting of the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals. The
members shall serve 4 year terms after which time they shall be reappointed or
replaced by the City Council of the City of Streetsboro. Each member shall
serve until his/her successor is appointed.
      (2)    A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals
Board. Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held
at the call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasijudicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
Planning and Zoning Department.
   (b)    Powers and Duties.
      (1)    The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of
these regulations.
      (2)    Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)    Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)    Variances. Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
   (e)    Application for a Variance.
      (l)    Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)    Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)    All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee in the amount of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) plus the
cost of the notices (Section
149.11, c).
   (f)    Notice for Public Hearing. Notices for public hearings for a variance
to these regulations shall conform to the procedures and requirements of
Section
1105.14 through
1105.17 
(Ordinance 1989-51. Passed 8-28-89; Ordinance 1993-01. Passed 1-25-93).
   (g)    Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)    The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
      (5)    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
      (8)    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
      (10)    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (h)   Variances shall only be issued upon: 
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)    A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)    A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (i)    Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (g)(1) to (11) have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
   (j)    Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)    All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)    A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)    The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and
testimony in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)    The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)    All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)    Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)    The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)    The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (k)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Portage Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 2004-139. Passed 9-27-04.)
   1122.07 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    Compliance Required.
      (l)    No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1122.04(k).
      (2)    Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)    Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)    Notice of Violation. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall

order shall:
      (1)    Be put in writing on an appropriate form;

of these regulations that have been violated, and order remedial action which,
if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of these regulations;
      (3)    Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)    Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)    Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However,

or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)    Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a fourth degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the City of Streetsboro. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent the City of Streetsboro from taking such other lawful action as
is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. The City of Streetsboro shall
prosecute any violation of these regulations in accordance with the penalties
stated herein.

by easements, sublots, water, wetlands, utilities, isolation or restricted
areas, topography (greater than 25% slope), or street right-of-way. The
Planning and Zoning Commission may allow a percentage of “unbuildable land”

subjection of each lot within the development to assessment of its
proportionate share of maintenance costs of the common property. Such legal
documents shall be filed with the application for approval of the open space
requirement and shall be approved as to form by the City Law Director. Such
legal documents shall be recorded as deeds or plats are recorded with the
County recorder. Or, the open space requirement may be accomplished by an
alternative approach approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission pursuant to
and in accordance with Chapter
1152.

   1151.01  CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall have the power to safeguard
the intent and objectives of this Zoning Ordinance by imposing appropriate
restrictions and safeguards as conditions of any approval it gives.
   (b)   In the exercise of the power to impose safeguards and conditions, the
Planning Commission may, including but not limited to SR 14 and SR 303, have
the power to limit or reduce street ingress and egress accesses as well as to
require owners and developers to grant easements to adjacent property owners in
such locations as the City Engineer shall require. These powers and conditions
are exercised, in general, to assure public health, safety, welfare and
convenience, to reduce the traffic impact along Streetsboro’s major
thoroughfares and to permit traffic to flow safely from site to site along
drives parallel to the state highways without having to cross multi-lane
highways. (Ord. 1999-118. Passed 8-23-99.)
   1151.02 INCONSISTENCIES.
   In the event any of the requirements or regulatory provisions of these
regulations are found to be inconsistent one with another, the more restrictive
or greater requirements shall be deemed in each case to be applicable.
(Ord. 1989-51. Passed 8-28-89.)
   1151.03  SPECIAL COSTS.
   When the Planning and Zoning Commission or Board of Zoning and Building
Appeals finds it necessary to maintain a strict record of public hearing
procedures, or when either the Commission or Board deems it necessary to cause
special studies to be made, then the applicant shall bear all direct and
related costs. (Ord. 1989-51. Passed 8-28-89.)
   1151.04 COMPLIANCE; PERMITTED USES.
   No building shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed or
structurally altered, nor shall any building or land with public and/or
privately developed improvements be used, arranged to be used or designed to be
used, in a manner which does not comply with all of the district provisions
established by these regulations for the districts in which the building or
land is located.
   (a)   Uses which do not appear in the Zoning Ordinance by virtue of their
omission from all permitted use lists, all conditionally permitted use lists,
all accessory use lists and all other use lists are prohibited.
   (b)   A prohibited use may become a permitted use if Council passes an
amendment incorporating the prohibited use into appropriate use lists for
appropriate zoning districts.
   (c)   A prohibited use may become a permitted use if the City Planning
Commission determines the use should be a permitted use in an appropriate
zoning district because it is substantially similar in character to
specifically permitted use in such district.
      (Ord. 1989-51. Passed 8-28-89.)
   1151.05 PROHIBITED USES.
   No use shall be permitted or authorized to be established which, when
conducted in compliance with the provisions of these regulations, and any
additional conditions and requirements prescribed, is or may become hazardous,
noxious or offensive due to the emission of odor, dust, smoke, cinders, gas,
fumes, noise, vibration, electrical interference, refuse matter or water
carried wastes. (Ord. 1989-51. Passed 8-28-89.)
   1151.06  NUISANCE.
   No use shall be permitted or authorized which, even though when conducted it
complies with the requirements of applicable codes and permits, may become
hazardous, noxious or offensive due to the emission of odor, dust, smoke,
cinders, gas, fumes, noise vibration, electrical interference, refuse matter or
water carried wastes.
(Ord. 1989-51. Passed 8-28-89.)
   1151.07 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER APPLICABLE REGULATIONS.

and the development of industrial parks or parcels as required by this
Ordinance. (Ord. 1989-51. Passed 8-28-89.)
   1151.30  WETLAND PROTECTION. 
   Wetlands that are required by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers or the Ohio
EPA to be retained and protected shall be further protected by the following:
   (a)   A buffer area having a width not less than 20 feet, measured from the
edge of the designated wetland. The area within this buffer shall not be
disturbed and shall be retained in its natural state; and
   (b)    A minimum building and pavement setback of 35 feet, measured from the
edge of the designated wetland.
These buffers may be increased by the Planning and Zoning Commission where the
type of wetland so require, but in general shall not exceed 300 feet. In making
a determination on the appropriate buffer width, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may consult with technical experts such as the City Planning
Director, City Engineer, and Soil and Water Conservation District, or others
qualified (including those offered by the applicant), to provide a
recommendation to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (Ord. 2004-183. Passed 11-22-04.)
   1151.31 CONSERVATION OF RIPARIAN ZONES.
   A riparian buffer shall be provided along the entire length and on both
sides of a river or perennial stream channel. The buffer area shall have a
width not less than 50 feet, measured from the river or stream bank. Small
streams without clearly defined high water marks shall be measured from the
stream centerline. This buffer may be increased by the Planning and Zoning
Commission where the type of stream, slope of the stream banks, surrounding
soils, vegetation, land uses, and the function of the stream so require, but in
general shall not exceed 300 feet. In making a determination on the appropriate
buffer width, the Planning and Zoning Commission may consult with technical
experts such as the City Planning Director, City Engineer, and Soil and Water
Conservation District, or others qualified (including those offered by the
applicant), to provide a recommendation to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   The area within this buffer shall not be disturbed and shall be retained in
its natural state, except that walking or bike trails and other non-intrusive
uses may be permitted to be located within the riparian buffers when the
Planning and Zoning Commission determines that such use will create minimal
impacts within the buffer and to the stream.  
(Ord. 2004-183. Passed 11-22-04.)

who remains resident for more than thirty (30) consecutive days shall be deemed
to reside there with the consent of the facility's management, regardless of
whether the occupant, guest or tenant has checked out and/or relocated to
another room in the same facility.
   (d)   An extended stay hotel, residential hotel, or SRO facility will be
considered a legal non-conforming use on and after the effective date of this
section only if on that date it is legally operating as an extended stay hotel,
residential hotel, or SRO facility under a valid license issued pursuant to
Ohio Revised Code §3731.03. The legal non-conforming use will be deemed
discontinued if the license is later surrendered, revoked, or terminates by

   1152.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for site plan review
as well as provide general site design and planning guidelines. These site
planning guidelines are intended to insure that all elements required in this
chapter are present in a site plan and that their design, location and
relationship to one another, to the site and to adjacent properties are
appropriate to achieve the intent and goals of this chapter. The site planning
guidelines are intended to guide the site plan review process to make sure that
significant design elements shall be considered in future development.
(Ord. 1989-48. Passed 8-28-89.)
   1152.02 SITE PLAN REVIEW. 
   (a)    The Planning and Zoning Commission shall conduct a site plan review
for the following types of projects and developments:
            (1)   New construction of all uses, except:
         A.   Single-family and two-family dwellings, if permitted, within the
F-P, O-C, R-R, R-T, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-G, R-PUD, C-R and R-OS Overlay zoning
districts; and
         B.    Agricultural and their accessory or subordinate uses.
      (2)   Changing the use or architectural feature, including building
color, of an existing building or structure to another use or architectural
feature, except single-family and two-family dwellings and agricultural uses.
      (3)   Projects (except single family, two-family or agricultural) that
are contemplating an addition or expansion which have any of the following
effects:
         A.    Increase the floor area by fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
existing floor area.
         B.   Alterations or re-arrangement of on-site parking which results in
a reduction or increase in the number of parking spaces or placement within a
required front yard.
         C.   Alteration of traffic flow by way of ingress and egress, or
within the site itself.
         D.    Construction of public or private off-street parking areas where
permitted in this Zoning Ordinance.
      (4)    Site plan amendment.
         A.    Any approved site plan may be amended by request of the
applicant for site plan amendment.
         B.   The amended site plan shall show specifically what is proposed to
be changed and details on the change. This may be accomplished by submitting
applicable information in accordance with this chapter.
   
   (b)    No development or change of use described in Section
1152.02 shall be permitted until the site plan has been reviewed and approved
by the Planning and Zoning Commission, and they determine that the plan is
consistent with the purposes and requirements of this Zoning Code, and that the
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
(Ord. 2024-41. Passed 2-26-24.)
   1152.03 SITE PLAN APPLICATION.
   (a)    All projects described in Section
1152.02 shall necessitate the filing of an application for site plan review
with the Zoning Inspector, who shall determine the completeness of the
application as per this section. If the application is not complete, the Zoning
Inspector shall not accept the application and shall inform the applicant of
the application's inadequacies. No application shall be accepted until all fees
are paid, as per Section
1107.08 of this Code.
(Ord. 1989-48. Passed 8-28-89.)
   1152.04 SITE PLAN REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    The application for site plan review shall include the following
items:
      (1)   Application form completed.
      (2)   Architectural plans (three copies), showing exterior elevations and
floor plans. If exterior elevations are not available, reasonable graphic
representations may be submitted.
      (3)   The site plan drawings (fourteen copies), showing the following
items:
         A.   General vicinity map.
         B.    Property boundary lines and adjacent streets.
         C.    Elevation contours.
         D.    Traffic, circulation plan.
         E.    Parking and loading plan.
         F.    Landscaping plan.
         G.    Existing structures.
         H.    Proposed signage.
         I.    Utilities plan.
         J.    Grading, sedimentation and erosion control plan.
   (b)   All site plan drawings shall be prepared by a professional engineer,
architect or surveyor, and shall have their seal on the plans.
   (c)   The site plan shall show provision for control of erosion,
sedimentation and stormwater. The goal of these provisions are to prevent
sediment from leaving the site and to allow no increase in stormwater runoff.
The Portage Soil and Water Conservation District, soil scientists, or other
competent agencies shall review the site plan. When planning and applying these
provisions the following principles will be followed:
      (1)   Control sediment with silt fence and siltation basins. The basins
will be designated and installed before the construction begins so that all of
the surface water from exposed areas passes through these basins. Silt fencing
will be installed as needed. The basins will be designated in accordance with
the Soil Conservation Service specifications.
      (2)   The basins will be cleaned out as needed to maintain adequate
retention time.
      (3)   Temporary seedings will be done to all areas when construction
continues through or is not completed before the winter season. Seeding will be
completed before October 1.
      (4)   At construction completion, stormwater retention basins will be
established by conversion of sediment basins or other means. Stormwater
retention practices will be designed so that post construction runoff is the
same as pre-construction runoff. No after construction increase in amount of
peak flow will be allowed.
      (5)   Assistance in completion of the site plan can be obtained from the
Portage Soil and Water Conservation District at 6970 State Route 88 in Ravenna,
Ohio 44266, 216/296-4311.
      (6)   Sediment basins (debris basins, desilting basins or silt traps)
shall be installed and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters, from
land undergoing development, etc.
      (7)   Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
run- off caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development. (Use, etc.).
      (8)   The permanent final vegetation and structures shall be installed as
soon as practical in the development, use restoration, rehabilitation, etc.
      (9)   The development, extraction or use plan shall be fitted to the
topography and soils so as to create the least erosion potential.
      (10)   Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and
protected.
  
   (d)   Waste Disposal Plans.  
      (1)   Site plans shall show location and screening/fencing materials for
outdoor refuse collection areas, also known as dumpster enclosures, which shall
be screened/fenced on three sides with a fully opaque gate on the fourth side,
and shall show adequate ingress and egress for trucks to haul refuse away.
Dumpster enclosures shall be similar in character to the materials of the
principal structure to which the enclosure is accessory. Acceptable gate
materials include wood or metal; chain link gates shall be prohibited.
      (2)   Site plans shall be accompanied by a statement for industrial uses
of how hazardous wastes will be handled including a statement that no poisonous
or hazardous wastes will be discharged into the sanitary sewer or storm sewer,
other than EPA acceptable levels.
   (e)   Site plans for multifamily units shall provide for centralized TV
antenna.
   (f)   Site plans shall show that the relationship between buildings, open
spaces, roads, drives, parking areas are located and related so as to minimize
the possibility of adverse impacts upon adjacent development.
   (g)    A list of property owners within 250 feet of the property lines of
subject property, as they appear on the County Auditor's current tax list or
Treasurer's mailing list.
   (h)   Copies of current tax maps for subject and above properties shall be
submitted.
   (i)   The proposed development shall conform to all applicable subdivision
regulations including public site provisions of Section
1181.06 and
1183.01(d).
(Ord. 2023-63. Passed 4-10-23.)
   1152.05 ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT.
   (a)   In concert with enhancing and preserving environmental quality, an
environmental assessment report shall be filed for projects (1) requiring Site
Plan Review (Chapter
1152) or (2) if required by the Planning and Zoning Commission under Plat
Review (Chapter
1177).
   The policy of the City shall be to use all practicable means and measures to
create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in
productive harmony and fulfill the social, economic and other requirements of
present and future generations. Every resident has a responsibility to the
environment. There is a need to understand the relationship between the
maintenance of high quality ecological systems and the general welfare of the
people of the City, including their enjoyment of the natural resources of the
City. It is the intent of the City that the protection and enhancement of the
environment shall be given appropriate weight with social and economic
consideration in public policy. Social, economic and environmental factors
shall be considered together in reaching decisions on proposed activities. In
order to carry out the provisions of this Section
1152.05, it is the continuing responsibility of the City to use all practicable
means, consistent with other essential considerations, to improve and
coordinate plans, facilities, program and resources to the end that the City
may:
      (1)   Fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the
environment for succeeding generations.
      (2)   Assure for all residents safe, healthful, productive and
aesthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings.
      (3)   Attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment
without degradation, risk to health or safety or other undesirable and
unintended consequences.
      (4)   Preserve important historic, cultural and natural aspects of our
heritage, and maintain, wherever possible, an environment which supports
diversity and variety of individual choice.
      (5)   Achieve a balance between growth and resource use which will permit
high standards of living and wide sharing of life's amenities.
      (6)   Enhance the quality of renewable resources and approach the optimum
attainable recycling of depletable resources.
   (b)    Required Information. Each environmental assessment report prepared
in accordance with this Section
1152.05 shall include the following:
      (1)   A description of the proposed action;
      (2)   A description of the existing environmental setting;
      (3)   The favorable and adverse environmental impacts of the proposed
action;
      (4)   The means and estimated costs necessary to minimize the adverse
impacts;
      (5)   Identification of alternatives to the proposed action including
their impact on the environment;
      (6)   Identification of any irreversible commitment of natural resources
as a result of the proposed action;
      (7)   The growth-inducing aspects of the proposed action as related to
natural resources; and
      (8)   A calculation of the recommended maximum residential density, if
applicable.
   (c)    Review of Environmental Assessment Report. The environmental
assessment report shall be presented to the Planning and Zoning Commission
along with the site plan or proposal under consideration. Prior to any
determination on the proposed project, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
review and consider the environmental assessment report together with any
comments submitted by the administrative departments or others.
   (d)    Basis for Approval. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall not
grant preliminary approval of any project or development unless it finds that
the environmental impact of the project or development shall be in harmony with

   (d)    Notify property owners and other parties by mail, fifteen days prior
to the Planning Commission meeting at which the subject site plan will be
considered.
      (Ord. 1989-48. Passed 8-28-89.)
   1152.07  PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEW. 
   The Planning Commission shall then review the site plan to determine
compliance with this Code and fulfillment of planning and design objectives.
The Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove within ninety days of the
date of the initial Planning Commission meeting. If modifications are required,
the applicant shall be notified of necessary modifications. The Commission
shall have an additional thirty days to approve or disapprove the site plan
once the modifications have been re-submitted at the Planning Commission
meeting. An extension of time may be taken if mutually agreed to in writing.
(Ord. 1989-48. Passed 8-28-89.)
   1152.08 NOTIFICATION OF ACTION.
   (a)    The Planning Commission may seek expert advice or cause special
studies to be made during the review time period and such costs shall be borne
by the applicant, but shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) (except
PUDs) which sum shall be deposited with the City at the request of the Planning
Commission.
   (b)    If approved, the applicant shall be notified in writing. The Chairman
of the Planning Commission shall sign and date a copy of the approved plans,
which shall become the officially approved site plan. From that date, the
applicant shall have one year to obtain a zoning permit from the Zoning
Inspector. Failure to obtain the permit within one year, shall cause the
approved site plan to be invalid and the applicant must re-apply in accordance
with Section
1152.03 of this Zoning Ordinance. Each reapplication shall be accompanied by a
fee as specified in Section
1107.08. 
   (c)    If the plan is disapproved, the applicant shall be notified in
writing. The plan may not be re-submitted to the Commission for one year from
the official decision, unless revisions are made to bring the site plan into
conformance. (Ord. 1989-48. Passed 8-28-89.)
   1152.09 CONFORMANCE TO SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)    Site plan approval may be revoked if proposed development has not
been issued a zoning occupancy permit and is found to be violating the
requirements of this Zoning Ordinance and/or any condition attached to site
plan approval by the Planning Commission.
   (b)    In order to revoke a site plan approval, the Commission shall
schedule a hearing and notify the original applicant or project representatives
twenty days prior to the hearing by certified mail.
   (c)    In the event that the Commission decides to revoke approval the
occupancy permit shall not be issued until the Commission certifies that the
violation(s) has been corrected.
   (d)    Where such a violation involves a project where an occupancy permit
has been issued, the violation shall be treated as a violation to this Zoning
Ordinance and be subject to penalty as specified in Section
1107.11.
(Ord. 1989-48. Passed 8-28-89.)
   1152.10  STAGED DEVELOPMENT. 
   Where a proposed site plan shows a staged development, each stage shall be
constructed within the timeframe specified in Section
1107.05.
(Ord. 1989-48. Passed 8-28-89.)
   1152.11  FINANCIAL GUARANTEES.
   Prior to issuance of zoning permits, a cash bond or other financial
guarantee shall be placed on deposit with the Finance Director of the City, to
insure that improvements, such as landscaping, parking and sidewalks, are
installed in conformance with the approved site plan. The bond or guarantee
shall be for the construction cost estimate of the improvements based on an
estimate approved by the City Engineer, plus twenty percent (20%) of the
estimate in lieu of increased costs, and shall be for a period not to exceed
two years and providing for the complete construction of the improvements
within that period. Such performance bond or other financial guarantees shall
be returned to the applicant only if and after the certificate of occupancy is
issued to the applicant. (Ord. 1989-48. Passed 8-28-89.)
   1152.12 DESIGN GUIDELINES. 
   The following guidelines are to be used by those involved in site planning
and design to guide the site planning process and to serve as the Planning
Commission's and Beautification Committee's guidelines for judging appropriate
site design features.
   (a)    Relationship to Adopted Plans and Policies.
      (1)    The site plan shall reflect all City plans and policies affecting
the site, including neighborhood plans, key areas plans, master concept plans
or previously adopted planned unit residential or planned commercial or
industrial development plans.
      (2)    The site plan shall be consistent with the statement of intent for
the zoning district in which it is located.
   (b)    Site Planning/Open Space.
      (1)    The natural topographic and landscape features of the site should
be incorporated into the development wherever possible.
      (2)    Buildings and open spaces should be in proportion and scale with
existing structures and spaces in the surrounding area.
      (3)    A site should not be so overcrowded as to cause unbalanced
relationships of buildings to open space. Open space areas should not be unduly
isolated from one another by unrelated physical obstructions such as buildings
and paved vehicular areas, but rather, should be linked by open space corridors
of reasonable width.
      (4)    When possible, natural separations should be created on the site
by careful planning of streets and clustering of buildings using natural land
features and open space for separation. Cul-de-sacs and loop streets, coupled
with open spaces, should be used to achieve separation and create identity for
sub-areas on the site.
   (c)   Building Design and Orientation.
      (1)    As dwelling unit intensities increase greater opportunities for
privacy should be provided by utilizing fences or walls to enclose internal
views.
(2)    The primary living area of a dwelling for the primary activity area of a
building should be oriented toward a natural site amenity where possible.
(3)    Buildings should be sited in an orderly, nonrandom fashion. Excessively
long, unbroken building facades should be avoided.
(4)    Consideration should be given in the siting of mid and high rise
buildings to the privacy of occupants of adjacent buildings.
(d)    Stormwater Management Measures. The careful design of stormwater
management measures shall be an integral part of the overall development
planning process.
      Stormwater runoff from the development should be handled, as much as
possible, through a natural system of roadside swales, grassed swales, grading
control, terraces, drop structures, induced infiltration, porous pavements and
detention/retention control. These should be designed as an integral part of
the open space amenities or the parking and circulation system on the site.
   (e)    Circulation.
      (1)    Street network. Short loop streets, cul-de-sacs and residential
streets should be used for access to low density residential land uses in order
to provide a safer living environment and a stronger sense of neighborhood
identity. Access to arterial streets should be limited, whenever possible, to
high density residential and non-residential land uses.
      (2)    Street alignment.
         A.    A combination tangent/curve street network should be used to
respect the existing natural features of a site, provide visual interest and
create a more practical alignment for efficient site planning of building
clusters.
B.    Horizontal and vertical alignment of streets should be designed to
minimize grading quantities. This includes working with the existing grade
rather than against the grade to avoid excessive cut or fill.
   Particular effort should be directed toward securing the flattest possible
grade near intersections.
      (3)    Pedestrian circulation.
         A.    Residential Uses:
            1.    The complete separation of vehicular/pedestrian circulation
should be achieved whenever possible.
            2.    Walkways which provide access to parking, trash disposal
facilities, mailboxes, service areas and community facilities should be
approximately four feet in width. Common area paths designed to carry heavier
pedestrian traffic should generally be five to six feet in width in order to
accommodate two pedestrian lanes or one pedestrian lane and one bicycle lane.
      (4)    Nonresidential uses.
         A.    Off-street parking area should be located within convenient
walking distance to the use being served.
         B.    Handicapped parking should be as near as possible to the
structure to avoid crossing parking aisleways.
         C.    Pedestrian and vehicular circulation should be separated as much
as possible, either through crosswalk/pavement markings, signalization or
complete grade separation.
         D.    Path and sidewalk crossings should be located where there is
good sight along the road. Ideally, street crossings should occur at
intersections.
   (f)    Parking Lots and Garages.
      (1)    When locating points of ingress and egress, consideration should
be given to the location of existing access points, adjacent to and directly
across the street from the site. Curb cuts should be shared by adjoining uses
whenever possible.
(2)    Parking areas should be screened and landscaped and traffic islands
should be provided to protect circulating vehicles and to break-up the monotony
of continuously paved areas.
(3)    Drive-through establishments, such as banks, should be located to allow
stacking space for peak hour operation and not restrict other parking lot
circulation.
(4)    Detached residential garages and carports should respect the location of
adjacent garages and driveways and should be architecturally compatible with
the principal structures on the site. When possible, garages should be
incorporated as a screening element in the overall site plan and used to create
private outdoor spaces and block objectionable views.
   (g)    Architectural Character, Continuity and Comparability.
      (1)    Development and infill development should be viewed as part of a
cluster, block, neighborhood, or the entire community. Developments should be
designed with the idea of being architecturally compatible with nearby
structures or to screen incompatible elements of nearby development.
(2)    Within the standards of the applicable zoning district, the height,
scale and setback of each building should be compatible with existing or
proposed adjoining buildings. Architectural style should not necessarily
duplicate adjoining structures, but should be compatible in overall form,
texture, color and rhythm.
(h)    Architectural Style.
(1)    The following is a checklist for evaluating architectural character and
compatibility. The following elements should be considered in determining the
archictural style or character of an area and whether a proposed development is
compatible with surrounding uses.
A.    Form (building footprint) - are the structures small or massive;
rectangular or linear; close together or far apart.
B.    Height - are the buildings primarily horizontal or vertical.
C.    Building materials - what are the predominant materials used; are there
several materials used or only one or two.
D.    Colors - what are the predominant colors used on the buildings; are many
colors or only a few colors used.
         E.    Roof pitches - are the roofs sloped or flat; what specific roof
types are used.
         F.    Window and door details - what is the arrangement, proportion
and design details of windows and doors.
         G.    Complexity - are the building walls broken or unbroken; is the
overall design simple or ornate.
         H.    Paved areas and service areas - where is the location of parking
garages and service areas; what is the amount and location of paving on the
site; is the front yard paved; how do buildings relate to streets.
         I.    Landscaping - what is the amount, location and type of
landscaping and open space around the buildings and on the site.
         J.    Signs and street furniture - what types and number of signs and
street furniture are provided; where are they located in relationship to
structures.
      (2)    Consistency in architectural style should be provided within a
development or an infill area.
(3)    The architectural style should be carried out in as authentic manner as
possible.
(4)    Variety can be provided within a particular architectural style by
subtly varying building form, setbacks, colors and materials.
   (i)    Signs.
      (1)    All signs, including wall, free-standing and window display should
be of a complimentary scale and proportion in design and in visual relationship
to the site and its structures. Signs within a development should be compatible
with each other and signs should not compete for attention with signs on
adjoining premises.
(2)    The colors, materials and lighting of every sign should be restrained,
and harmonious with the building site to which it relates. Signs should define
or enhance architectural elements of the building, not obscure or destroy them.
(3)   The number of graphic elements on each sign should be held to the minimum
level needed to convey the sign's major message and should reflect simplicity,
neatness and minimum wording, not only to avoid visual clutter, but to improve
legibility.
(4)    Signage on each building should be consolidated and coordinated.
(5)    Signs should identify the name and type of establishment and not
advertise products or brand names.
(j)    Climatic Considerations/Energy Conservation (Optional).
(1)    Consideration should be given to both over and underheated periods of
the year when determining building locations.
(2)    To maximize the effect of solar radiation in winter months and maximize
shade in the summer months.
         A.    Deciduous trees should be used for summer shade and winter
warmth.
         B.    Active living spaces should be oriented to the south for winter
warmth.
         C.    Building overhangs should be designed to shield the high summer
sun and expose the area to the lower winter sun.
      (3)    Steeply pitched roofs should be used on the windward side to
deflect wind and reduce the roof area affected by the winds.
      (4)   Bland walls, garages or storage uses should be used on north
exposures.
      (5)    North entrances should be protected with earth mounds, evergreens
and walls and fences.
(6)    Natural ventilation with prevailing summer breezes should be allowed for
whenever possible.

Entertainment Uses have been known to cause undesirable secondary effects on
residential and institutional uses, particularly those where children are
present, as well as adjacent non-adult entertainment retail uses. Therefore, to
prevent potential deterioration in the C-3 Highway Interchange Commercial

   (a)   Floor Area. For the purposes of this section "floor area" in offices,
merchandising and service types of uses shall mean the area used for service to
the public and excludes areas used principally for non-public purposes such as
storage, incidental repair, processing, show windows, rest rooms and dressing
rooms. In measurement for parking space, fractions of required floor area over
one-half shall require one parking space.
   (b)    Parking Space Dimensions. The minimum dimensions for a parking space
shall be:
      (1)    Nine feet and six inches in width and nineteen feet in length for
all angle parking, including right angle parking.
      (2)    Nine feet in width and twenty-three feet in length for all
parallel parking.
   All dimensions shall be exclusive of driveways, aisles and other circulation
areas.
   (c)    Parking Area Design. Such parking areas shall be of useable shape,
improved with bituminous concrete, or equivalent surfacing and so graded and
drained as to dispose of all surface water accumulation within the area. All
lighting used to illuminate such parking areas shall be so arranged as to
direct the light away from adjoining premises or streets and no open light
sources such as the stringing of light bulbs shall be permitted. Wheel guards,
including bumper guards as may be necessary, shall be provided in connection
with any off-street parking area of five cars or more, and shall be constructed
so as to confine the storm water surface drainage to the premises; to contain
the cars on sloping surfaces; and to prevent bumper overhang.
   (d)    Entrances and Exits. Entrances and exits shall be located to minimize
traffic congestion and avoid undue interference with pedestrian access at
street intersection corners. There shall not be more than two accessways
abutting on any one street. The minimum and maximum widths of such accessways
shall be determined by the City Engineer in accordance with ODOT Location and
Design Manual, Volume 1, Section 803, with concurrence of the Planning
Director, except that residential uses shall have accessways of not less than
eight feet.
   (e)    Truck Circulation. Truck parking areas, maneuvering lanes and
accessways to public roads shall be designed to cause no interference with the
safe and convenient movement of automobile and pedestrian traffic on and
adjacent to the site.
   (f)    Residential and/or Commercial Districts. The parking and loading
regulations for all districts which permit multiple uses shall be the same as
the regulations for commercial and/or residential uses as they would otherwise
apply individually. The Planning and Zoning Commission may reduce the parking
and loading space requirements for multiple uses as a conditional use in
accordance with Sections
 1155.03 and
1155.04.
   (g)    Yard Restrictions.
      (1)    In all O-C, R-R, R-1 and R-2 Districts, required off-street
parking facilities shall not occupy any portion of the required front or side
yard, but where open may be included as part of a required open space for a
rear yard.
      (2)    In all R-3, R-O and I Districts, open off-street parking
facilities may be located in all yards provided that at least a twenty foot
wide landscaped strip is located between the parking area and the street right-
of-way line. When off-street parking facilities are located in the required
side or rear yard on the portion of the lot adjacent to a parcel in an O-C, R-
R, R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-O District, a minimum ten foot wide landscaped area
shall be located between such parking area and the side or rear lot line, and
such parking lot shall be screened from the adjacent parcel by a fence, wall or
compact hedge at least four feet in height.
   (h)    Location. The parking spaces required for dwelling units shall be
located on the lot and parking spaces required for other uses shall be located
on the lot or within 500 feet of the use measured along lines of public access
to the property but shall not be allowed in residential districts, except as
provided in subsection (i) hereof.
   (i)    Joint Use.
      (1)    Parking spaces already provided to meet off-street parking
requirements for places of public assembly, commercial and industrial
establishments, lying within 500 feet of a church measured along lines of
public access, and that are not normally used between the hours of 6:00 a. m.
and 6:00 p. m. on Sundays, and are made available for other parking, may be
used to meet no more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the off-street parking
requirements of a church.
      (2)    Parking spaces already provided to meet off-street parking
requirements for commercial and industrial establishments lying within 500 feet
of a place of public assembly along lines of public access, that are not
normally in use between 6:00 p. m. and midnight, and are made available for
other parking, may be used to meet not more than fifty percent (50%) of the
total requirements of parking space.
      (3)    In the case of a mixed use facility, the number of off-street
parking facilities required shall equal the sum of the required spaces of the
various uses computed individually if the Planning and Zoning Commission
determines that special characteristics of the uses within such a facility will
require fewer spaces than the computed sum, in which case the Commission may
reduce the required number of spaces by no more than one-half of the sum of the
spaces required for each individual use as a conditional use.
   (j)    Parking Lots in Residential District. The Planning and Zoning
Commission may issue a conditional zoning certificate for parking lots in
residential districts subject to the following conditions:
      (1)    The parking lot shall be accessory to and for the use in
connection with one or more permitted or conditionally permissible uses in and
adjoining commercial or industrial district.
      (2)    Such parking lot shall contain not less than 5,000 square feet,
which shall abut at least fifty feet, either directly or across an alley or
street, on the district in which the use for which the parking is provided,
permitted or conditionally permissible.
      (3)    Such parking lot area shall conform to the minimum building lines
of the district in which the parking area is located.
      (4)    Such parking lot shall be used solely for the parking of passenger
vehicles and no commercial repair work or service of any kind shall be
conducted on such parking lot.
      (5)    No sign of any kind, other than those designating entrances, exits
and conditions of use shall be maintained on such parking lot. Entrances and
exits shall be at least twenty feet from any adjacent property located in any
residential district. Such parking lot shall be efficiently screened on each
side by a fence of acceptable design, wall or compact hedge. Such fence, wall
or hedge shall be not less than four feet in height and no solid portion shall
be more than six feet in height and shall be maintained in good condition. The
planting strip for hedges shall be no less than three feet in width. At least
one water outlet shall be provided not more than fifty feet from the lot for
maintenance of plant materials. The space between such fence, wall or hedge and
the side lot line of adjoining premises in any residential district shall be
landscaped with grass, hardy shrubs or evergreen ground cover and maintained in
good condition
   (k)    Off-Street Parking Landscaping. Parking areas, in any zoning
district, shall be provided with fifteen square feet of landscaping per space
within the parking area which shall be distributed reasonably evenly across the
parking area when the following conditions exist:
      (1)    The parking area has a minimum of thirty parking spaces;
      (2)    The parking area consists of one or more double-loaded parking
aisles; and
      (3)    The parking area, or portion thereof, is in full view from the
street right of way or adjacent to residential district.
The Planning and Zoning Commission, in reviewing the development plan pursuant
to Section
1151.27, may reduce the amount of landscaping required when it determines that
the landscaping required is not necessary in reducing the adverse impact of
such parking area on adjacent street right of ways or adjacent residential
property.
(Ord. 2018-80. Passed 6-11-18.)
   (l)   With respect to any non-residential use, including three-family, four-
family, and multifamily uses, the Planning and Zoning Commission may, upon
finding that the number of parking spaces required by Section
1155.02 are not reasonably necessary in order to provide adequate parking for a
proposed development, authorize or require a developer to provide a lesser
number of actual parking spaces and to landbank the remaining spaces required
by Section
1155.02 for future parking needs. The entire landbanked area shall be shown on
the site plan and improved with landscape plantings as approved by the
Commission. In the event a future change of use or tenancy or expansion of a
use requires, in the determination of the Commission, additional actual
parking, then the Commission shall require that additional parks spaces be
provided from the previously landbanked area of the development. The Planning
and Zoning Commission may grant a deviation to the number and dimensions of
landbanked parking spaces as a part of the Site Plan Review or Site Plan
Amendment approval process, provided that the Commission determines that the
applicant has submitted sufficient evidence to support the deviation.
(Ord. 2009-76. Passed 6-22-09; Ord. 2023-144. Passed 11-13-23.)
   1155.04 MINIMUM LOADING AND UNLOADING SPACES.
   Every building used for nonresidential purposes which customarily receives
or distributes goods by motor vehicle shall provide sufficient space on the
premises for all loading and service purposes on the basis of the following
minimum regulations:
   (a)    Access to truck loading and unloading space shall be provided
directly from a public street or alley or from any right of way that will not
interfere with public convenience and that will permit the orderly and safe
movement of such trucks.
   (b)    Loading space required pursuant to this section shall be provided in
addition to off-street parking spaces required under Section
1155.01 and shall not be considered as supplying any portion of the required
off-street parking spaces.
      (Ord. 1980-20. Passed 1-28-80.)
   1155.05 PARKING AND LOADING FOR USES NOT SPECIFIED. 
   Where the off-street parking and loading requirements for a use are not
specifically defined herein, the parking and loading facilities for such use
shall be developed so as to be sufficient to meet all the parking and loading
needs of the proposed use; no parking, loading or servicing shall be done on
the right of way of any publicly dedicated thoroughfare.

   1165.04 TOPOGRAPHICAL SITE PLAN REQUIREMENTS FOR SINGLE, TWO AND THREE
FAMILY DWELLINGS.
   The site plan requirements for single, two and three family dwellings shall
include the following:
   (a)    The plan shall show the existing topography of the lot and land
adjacent thereto as indicated: buildings adjacent thereto, proposed finished
yard elevations at points indicated, proposed finished floor elevations,
proposed basement floor elevation, proposed drainage swales, driveway, driveway
catch basin(s), walks, building storm sewer, sanitary sewer, water line,
electric service line, telephone service line, rear-yard basin, when required,
and any other utilities. If the lot is in a development or subdivision, this
plan shall be in addition to the mass grading plan and the existing elevations
shown shall be those elevations as existing at the time of application for
building permit. The final lot grading shall be in general conformance with the
surrounding lots and mass grading plan. An elevation at the building setback
line shall show the front elevations of the house in relation to the existing
or proposed grading of the adjacent lots and their houses either existing or
under construction. In addition to the elevations shown, the plan shall also
show the existing and proposed contours at one-foot intervals. For large size
lots, the existing elevations and contours need not be shown more than 100 feet
beyond construction limits and the required sheet size of the plan may be
larger.
   (b)    Each lot shall be shown to be graded so that the front yard slopes
toward the street and that the ground slopes away from the building. Side yard
swales shall be constructed and maintained between all houses to a minimum
depth of three inches below finished grade at the lowest adjacent house, and
shall be deep enough to drain any swale at the rear of the house.
   (c)    Where the rear yard slopes towards the house, a swale shall be
constructed at least thirteen feet to the rear of the house to a minimum depth
of three inches below the finished building grade of that house and shall drain
to the side yard swales.
   (d)    In a case where lots behind the subject lot are higher in elevation
and the rear yards of the high lots slope toward the rear of the subject lot,
swales on the lower lots or lots shall be constructed along the side lot lines
with an average depth of three inches below the lowest adjacent lot surface at
the building and shall extend from the front lot line to the rear lot line. In
this case, drainage from no more than two high rear lots shall accumulate to
outlet along a side line of a given low lot.
      (e)    Where the rear yards slope toward the rear of the lot and the
method of grading described above is not possible, a catch basin shall be
constructed in a swale constructed along the rear lot line. In subdivisions,
the maximum distance between catch basins along the length of any such rear
swale shall be 100 feet and each lot shall have a catch basin at its rear lot
line. Catch basins shall be either constructed during the development phase or
the building phase, but shall exist prior to the issuance of an occupancy
permit. Each such swale and catch basin shall be maintained by the property
owner to ensure effective and total storm water control. In a development, the
center of the swale may be along the property line and in any other case it
shall be at least six feet, but not more than ten feet, onto the property being
developed and a minimum of four inches below the lower property.
     (f)    For additions to existing dwellings and detached garage
construction on an existing site, site drainage shall be maintained in
accordance with the above.
   (g)    No yard slope shall exceed a one-foot rise vertically for a five-foot
horizontal distance when possible.
   (h)   All sanitary sewer house connections shall be indicated on the site
plans as follows:
      (1)    From the curb connection to the front of the dwelling or to the
individual waste water system, if approved, shall be shown.
      (2)    If a central collection system (street sanitary sewer) is to be
used, the elevation of the invert of the nearest manhole and the estimated
invert elevation of the curb connection invert shall be shown. If an individual
waste water system approved by the County Board of Health is to be used, the
elevations and sizes of the septic tank tops, bottoms, inlets and outlets shall
be shown, including splitter box inlets and outlets, distribution boxes inlets
and outlets, inspection ports and all pipe lines, including materials and sizes
or evaporation-transpiration trench and filters or, details of, other approved
system shall be shown in detail.
      (3)    The site plan shall show the location of the test tee, two feet
minimum in the front yard from the street right-of-way and the invert elevation
at the front of the building, which shall be below the building footing.
      (4)    The grade of the house connection shall be a minimum of one
percent (1%).
   (i)    All roof drainage shall be collected by downspouts and directed into
the storm sewer drainage system, unless otherwise approved.
   (j)    All construction in designated floodplain areas shall be in
accordance with the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (k)    Prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit, iron lot pins shall be
installed on all lot corners by the builder as shown on the building site plan
and verified by the Residential Building Official and/or City Engineer.
   (l)    The site plan shall indicate all existing curbs, walks, water service
connector boxes, water line valve hydrants and manholes located in the street
right-of-way adjacent to the lot. All such appurtenances shall be protected by
the builder during construction, and any damage to them shall be repaired by
the builder and where repaired, such existing appurtenances reset by the
builder to proper grade prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit.
      (Ord. 2021-118. Passed 8-9-21.)

elevations. The following certification is to be included on the "as-built"
submittal:
      "I hereby certify that I have made the survey of record (as-built)
measurements shown hereon and that the information shown is a true
representation of the conditions which existed at the time of said survey".
      The surveyor is to sign, seal and date the revised topographical plan and
include his/her registration number.
   (e)   The City shall perform final grade inspection upon receipt of the as-
built topographical site plan. If the inspection reveals that the site does not
satisfy the final grade requirements, the City shall notify the permit holder
of deficiencies identified during the inspection. Following notification by the
permit holder, the City shall perform re-inspection of previously deficient
final grade. If all deficiencies are not corrected and/or the if City
identifies new items during the re-inspection, the City shall notify the permit
holder. Each re-inspection conducted by the City shall carry fees as specified
in Section
1165.07. If the site is determined to meet the requirements for the final
grade, the requirements were met within the 6-month period following issuance
of the building occupancy permit, and no violations exist, the surety bond
submitted pursuant to subsection (a) above shall be returned.
   (f)   Whenever the City determines it to be appropriate either during
construction or after its completion, the City may examine a construction site
for which the topography site plan has been submitted, to ensure no violations
beyond the established tolerances exist.

Procedures
1177.01    Purpose.
1177.02   Classification and determination of subdivision type.
1177.03   Minor subdivision.
1177.04   Major subdivision.
CROSS REFERENCE
   Planning authority approval without plat - see Ohio R.C. 711.131
   1177.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to specify the procedures that shall be
followed to subdivide land.
(Ord. 1981-99. Passed 8-24-81.)
   1177.02  CLASSIFICATION AND DETERMINATION OF SUBDIVISION TYPE.
   There are two basic types of subdivision:
   (a)    Minor Subdivision. The City Engineer may determine that a proposed
subdivision of land is a minor subdivision if the proposed division of a parcel
of land is along an existing public street, does not involve the opening,
widening or extension of any street or road and does not involve more than five
lots after the original tract has been completely subdivided.
   (b)    Major Subdivision. Any subdivision that does not meet the
requirements of a minor subdivision.
      (Ord. 1981-99. Passed 8-24-81.)
   1177.03 MINOR SUBDIVISION.
   (a)    Staff Granted the Authority of Review and Approval. The City Engineer
is authorized to represent the Planning Commission in the review and approval
of a minor subdivision, and to endorse the conveyance of a parcel or parcels of
land in a minor subdivision for transfer without plat.
   (b)    Submission of Minor Subdivision. Any person proposing to create a
minor subdivision shall submit the following to the Service Director.
      (1)    A legal description, of the parcel or parcels sought to be
transferred, on a conveyance of the parcel or parcels.
      (2)    Two copies of a private survey by a registered surveyor of the
parcel or parcels sought to be transferred. (See Appendix A.)
      (3)    Pins must be set at all new corners.
      (4)    Public right-of-way acreage must be stated separately from the net
acreage.
      (5)    The surveyor must certify an actual field survey and state
conditions and location of monuments already in place.
      (6)    The City Engineer's statement is to be on the plat.
      (7)    Sublots and secondary outlots must comply with zoning frontage.
      (8)    Minor subdivision fees. (See Section
1175.05.)
   (c)    Action by City Engineer. Within seven working days after submission
of a minor subdivision or within a mutually agreed upon extension, the City
Engineer shall either approve or disapprove the application for transfer
without plat.
   If the City Engineer does not approve the transfer without plat, the
applicant shall be notified in writing of the reason for disapproval. If the
City Engineer approves the transfer without plat, the conveyance shall be
stamped: "Approved by the Planning Commission, no plat required", and the
signature of the City Engineer affixed along with the date of such approval.
The approval shall expire within sixty days, unless the conveyances are
recorded in the office of the County Recorder during such period.
   (d)    Action by Health Commissioner. The City Engineer may, within seven
days after submission of a minor subdivision, submit the proposed subdivision
to the Health Commissioner who shall approve or disapprove building sites for
individual sewer systems. If disapproved, the Health Commissioner shall notify
the owner of the reasons for disapproval.
(Ord. 1985-50. Passed 5-28-85.)
   1177.04 MAJOR SUBDIVISION. 
   (a)    General Procedure. Major subdivisions shall be approved in seven
stages:
      (1)   Stage I. The submitter shall review the submittal with the Service
Director who shall attach comments relative to maintenance problems encountered
in the proximity of the development, and shall make distribution of preliminary
discussion material to the Planning Commission, Safety Department, Fire
Department, Park Board, City Engineer, and the appropriate sewer district
sanitary engineer. He shall notify the Mayor and Council of the submittal
through the regular Service Director's report. The City Engineer and Planning
Commission shall review the material with the developer at a work session and
coordinate the comments of City agencies and advise the developer of the
salient provisions of the master sewer, water, highway and park plans expected
by the development.
      (2)   Stage II. Preliminary plan shall be first presented to the Service
Director in quantities necessary for distribution as indicated in subsection
(a)(l) hereof. The preliminary plan shall include details as defined under
Section
1179.03 hereinafter. The City Engineer shall have a minimum of ten working days
to prepare comments for the Planning Commission formal session of preliminary
plan review.
      (3)   Stage III. Construction documents shall be presented to the City
Engineer and District Sanitary Engineer, in two copies including plans,
profiles and specifications as further described in subsection (d) hereof. The
City Engineer shall coordinate the comments of the City agencies relative to
the plans and advise the Planning Commission of any conflicts between or among
City agencies with recommendations, and the decision of the Planning Commission
shall be final in mediating such disputes. The submittals shall be in the hands
of the City Engineer ten working days prior to the scheduled Planning
Commission regular session. The Planning Commission shall notify the school
board of the plan approval.
      (4)   Stage IV. A construction agreement shall be negotiated with the
City through the Office of the Mayor, coordinating financial assurances of
improvements, traffic maintenance, safety precautions, delivery routing, load
limits, road cleaning, inspection costs/services, interruption of plan
modifications due to unforeseen hardship and other matters at the City's
discretion.
      (5)   Stage V. Construction Phase. During the construction phase the City
Engineer shall file the dedication plat and supervise his construction resident
inspector who shall maintain a log of working conditions and as built locations
for plan corrections by the owner's engineer. The City Engineer may stop work
if safety precautions, quality control, payment schedules, improvements or
procedures differ significantly from the stipulations of the construction
agreement. As built corrected original tracings shall be turned over to the
City Engineer. At the conclusion of the construction phase the City Engineer,
by joint inspection with the Service Director, shall issue a Certificate of
Substantial Completion which shall allow limited use of the improvements while
maintaining capital maintenance by the owner.
      (6)   Stage VI. Initial Occupancy. During the first eighteen months after
the issuance of the Certificate of Substantial Completion, the Service Director
shall assume responsibility for snow removal as required for citizen residents.
The City Engineer shall notify postal authorities, safety, fire protection and
school bus services of the public use of the improvements. The owner shall make
timely corrections to capital improvement deficiencies as may become evident
during initial occupancy. No occupancy permit shall be issued without the
Certificate of Substantial Completion.
      (7)   Stage VII. Formal acceptance of the improvement for all
maintenance, capital and public use shall be initiated by the submittal of the
approved improvements by the Service Director and the City Engineer to Council
and their acceptance of same for the City. In the event of a conflict between
the recommendations by the Engineer and the Service Director, the Mayor shall
mediate the dispute and make recommendation to Council. No improvement
financial assurances may be released to the developer until improvements have
been accepted by Council. A minimum of eighteen consecutive months must
transpire between the Certificate of Substantial Completion and the formal
acceptance of the improvements by Council. Capital repair items effected by the
developer during this period shall restart the eighteen consecutive months for
those items.
   (b)    Preliminary Conference. Before submitting an application for
preliminary plat, the applicant shall consult with the Planning Director and
the City Engineer. The applicant shall submit a preliminary discussion map
including all items required by Section
1179.02, and shall also obtain a preliminary steps certification form (see
Appendix C) from the Service Director, which shall be signed by the agencies
listed on the form. The purpose of the conference shall be to exchange
preliminary information that may affect the design of the subdivision,
including, but not limited to, the need for an environmental assessment report
under Section
1152.05.
   (c)    Preliminary Plat Procedure. 
      (1)    Submission of Preliminary Plat. An applicant shall make
application to the Planning Director for approval of a preliminary plat. All
information required by Section
1179.03 shall be submitted to the Planning Director at least ten (10) working
days before the meeting of the Planning and Zoning Commission at which the plat
is to be considered. When the application is complete (as determined by the
Planning Director), the application shall be submitted to the Planning and
Zoning Commission and placed on the agenda for the next regularly-scheduled
meeting, with the following information:
         A.   Two (2) copies of application. (See Appendix B.)
         B.   One (1) copy of the preliminary steps certification form. (See
Appendix C.)
         C.   At least ten (10) copies of the preliminary plat including a
vicinity map. (See Appendix D.)

         G.   The Service Director.
         H.   Such other persons or agencies the Planning Director deems
appropriate.
   The applicant may transmit copies of the preliminary plat to utility
companies and others as deemed necessary. The officials and agencies shall make
their review and submit their recommendations to the Planning and Zoning
Commission at least three (3) working days before the meeting of the Planning
and Zoning Commission at which the plat is to be considered.
      (3)    Official Filing of Preliminary Plat. Upon determination by the
Planning Director that the preliminary plat application has been properly
submitted, the preliminary plat and application shall be accepted as being
officially filed.
      (4)    Planning and Zoning Commission Action. The Planning and Zoning
Commission, within one hundred eighty days (180) of the date of official
filing, shall approve, approve conditionally, or disapprove the preliminary
plat. The action shall be noted on both the preliminary plat and application
and a copy of each returned to the applicant. The action shall also be entered
on the official records of the Planning and Zoning Commission and a copy of the
preliminary plat and application with action noted kept on file.
   In reviewing the preliminary plat, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
consider the recommendations and comments from the City Staff and Agencies and,
where appropriate, require submission of an environmental assessment report or
other data needed to assure compliance with these Regulations.
      (5)    Effect of Approval. Approval of a preliminary plat by the Planning
and Zoning Commission is not an acceptance of the subdivision for record. It is
an approval of a general plan as a guide for the preparation of improvement
plans and a subdivision plat for approval and recording upon fulfillment of all
requirements of these Regulations. Approval of a preliminary plat shall be
effective for a period of one (1) year following the date of approval by the
Planning and Zoning Commission unless an extension of time is granted. Upon
expiration of a preliminary plat approval, no approval of a plat shall be given
until the preliminary plat and application has been resubmitted and approved by
the Planning and Zoning Commission. Construction of improvements shall not
begin until action on the Construction Agreement has been taken by Council.
(See Section
1177.04(e)(3)).
   (d)    Improvement Plan Procedure. The applicant-developer’s engineer shall
prepare improvement plans that include all phases of the work to be performed
to make the land suitable for development into the use proposed. These plans
shall be complete and precise in all details, conform with the approved
preliminary plat, and be submitted to and approved by the City Engineer before
any improvements are constructed.
   (e)    Final Plat Procedure. 
      (1)    Submission of the Final Plat. The applicant shall make application
to the Planning and Zoning Commission for approval of a final plat. The final
plat submitted shall conform to the approved preliminary plat. Subdivisions may
be submitted for approval in consecutive sections provided that preliminary
plat and improvement plan approval has been given for the entire subdivision.
   All items as required by Section
1179.04 shall be submitted to the City Engineer as follows:
         A.   Two (2) copies of the application for final plat approval. (See
Appendix E.)
         B.   Original tracing and two (2) copies of plat and vicinity map.
(See Appendix F.)
         C.   Original tracing and four (4) copies of approved improvement
plans.
         D.   Plat fees. (See Section
1175.05.)
         E.   One (1) copy of financial assurances approved by City’s Law
Director in an amount stated by the City Engineer.
         F.   The City Engineer may request additional copies of any of the
above items and any other additional information deemed necessary.
   Within five (5) working days of the date of submission, the City Engineer
shall determine if all the items as required by Section
1179.04 have been submitted. If all the required items have not been submitted,
the City Engineer shall notify the applicant of such omissions.
      (2)    Official Filing of Plat. The City Engineer shall present to the
Planning and Zoning Commission the final plat documents, which meet the
requirements of Section
1179.04 at the next regularly-scheduled Planning and Zoning Commission meeting
after all required documents have been submitted. Upon determination by the
Planning and Zoning Commission that the plat has been properly submitted, the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall accept the plat as being officially filed
and shall certify on the copies the date of acceptance.
      (3)    Planning and Zoning Commission Action. The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall approve or disapprove the final plat within sixty (60) days
from the date of official filing or within a mutually agreed upon time
extension; otherwise, the plat shall be deemed to have been approved.   
   One of the following actions shall be taken by the Planning and Zoning
Commission:
         A.    Approval. The Planning and Zoning Commission may give approval
before all required improvements are installed, authorizing its chairman to
sign the plat at such time as a construction agreement and financial assurance,
acceptable to the City’s Law Director and City Engineer, are provided for the
purpose of assuring installation of such improvements. The amount of such
financial assurance shall be sufficient to cover the cost of all improvements,
based upon an estimate by the City Engineer. For the purpose of satisfying the
financial assurance requirement of this Section
1177.04(e)(3), it shall be sufficient for the applicant to submit the guarantee
of a solvent bank or other financial institution that funds in the amount of
the financial assurance requirement have been committed to the installation of
such improvements, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 1151.293 and that such funds
shall not be disbursed by the bank or financial institution without the prior
approval of the City Engineer. Upon receipt of the City Engineer’s
certification and determination that all the requirements of these Regulations
have been met, the Planning and Zoning Commission may give approval and shall
indicate such approval and date on the tracing of the plat.
         B.    Disapproval. Should the Planning and Zoning Commission determine
to disapprove the plat, written notice of such action, including reference to
the regulations or regulation violated by the plat, shall be mailed to the
applicant. The action shall also be entered on the official records of the
Planning and Zoning Commission.
         C.    Approval Without Board Action. In the event the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall fail to approve or disapprove the plat within sixty
(60) days from the date of its official filing, or within a mutually agreed
upon time extension, the final plat shall be deemed to have been approved.
         D.    Power to Review. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall have
the power to review, recommend, and regulate additional or a modification of
improvements under Section
1183.01, shade trees, street trees, shrubbery, and other vegetative plantings,
including buffer zones and setbacks and wetland and riparian setbacks in
residential subdivisions, commercial developments, and the development of
industrial parks or parcels as required by Chapters
1151 and
1152.
      (4)    Effect of Approval. Approval of a final plat by the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall not be an acceptance by the public of the offer of
dedication of any street, highway, or other public ways or open space upon the
plat unless such acceptance is also endorsed by Council upon the tracing of the
plat or upon ordinance of Council specifically accepting such streets as public
streets.
      (5)    Recording of Plat. After approval of a final plat by the Planning
and Zoning Commission, the applicant shall return the tracing to the City
Engineer who, after rechecking, shall secure approval of the Tax Map
Department. The City Engineer shall then present the plat to the County Auditor
for transfer and to the County Recorder for recording. All fees required in
connection with the above process as well as costs of reproductions of the plat
shall be paid by the applicant.

   1181.01 PHYSICAL CONSIDERATIONS.
   (a)    Natural Land Use. Subdivisions should be planned to take advantage of
the topography of the land to economize in the construction of drainage
facilities, to reduce the amount of grading and to minimize destruction of
trees and topsoil.
   (b)    Flood Hazard. If any portion of the land within the subdivision is
subject to flooding or other hazards, due consideration shall be given to such
problems in the design of the subdivision. Land subject to flooding and land
otherwise uninhabitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy nor for
such other uses that may increase danger to health, life or property, or
aggravate the flood hazard. (Ord. 1981-99. Passed 8-24-81.)
   1181.02 STREETS. 
   (a)    Arrangement. The arrangement, character, extent, width and location
of all streets shall conform to the locally adopted Land Use and Thoroughfare
Plan. The design of proposed streets shall provide for both the continuation of
existing streets and access to adjacent unplatted lands so that the entire area
can be served with a coordinated street system.
   (b)    Street Classifications.
      (1)    Major arterial thoroughfares shall be planned for continuation of
movement of fast traffic between points of heavy traffic generation and from
one section of the community to another. They shall contain as few
intersections with minor streets as possible. Such thoroughfares should
traverse the community and should be spaced approximately one mile apart.
      (2)    Collector streets shall provide a traffic route from local streets
to major arterial thoroughfares. These streets should be spaced at least one-
fourth mile apart.
      (3)    Local streets shall provide direct and full access to each lot and
shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic shall be discouraged.
      (4)    Parallel streets may be required along an existing or proposed
major arterial thoroughfare to provide access to lots along such major arterial
thoroughfares.
      (5)    Service drives shall be designed to provide only secondary access.
   (c)    Street Right-of-Way Widths and Grades and Standard Details. (Refer to
Appendix H.)

Light Industrial            60                         5       .5
   (d)    Half Streets. Half streets shall be prohibited except where there is
an existing half street adjacent to the subdivision in which case the remaining
half of the street shall be platted.
   (e)    Cul-de-Sacs and Dead-End Streets. Streets designed to be permanently
dead- ended shall not be longer than 600 feet and shall be provided at the
closed end with a turnaround having an outside pavement diameter of at least
100 feet and a street property line diameter of at least 120 feet. If such a
street is of a temporary nature and a future extension into adjacent land is
anticipated then the turning circle beyond the normal street width shall be in
the nature of an easement over the premises included in such turning circle,
but beyond the boundaries of the street proper. Such easements shall be
automatically vacated to abutting property owners, when the dead-end street is
legally extended into adjacent land, if such dead-end street is legally
extended into adjacent land. If such dead-end street extends only one lot depth
past a street intersection, no turnaround shall be required. Subdivider shall
be required to reserve for public use a strip of land five feet in width at the
end of all dead-end streets. No person or persons shall have access across this
property until an adjacent subdivision is developed and streets in such
development are dedicated for public use. The cost of paving such five foot
strip shall be borne by the subdivider connecting into such street.
   (f)    Corner Radii. Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded
with a radius of not less than fifty feet for major arterial thoroughfares,
thirty feet for collector and industrial streets and twenty feet for local
streets. Chords or cutoffs may be permitted in places of rounded corners.
Industrial park road right-of-way corner radius shall be sixty-five feet with
fifty foot curb corner radius.
   (g)    Horizontal and Vertical Curves. Angles in the alignment of street
lines shall be connected by a curve with a radius on the center line of not
less than 286.48 feet for local, collector and industrial streets, and 572.96
feet for major arterial thoroughfares. Between reverse curves there shall be a
tangent at least 100 feet long on major arterial thoroughfares. Every change in
street grade shall be made with a vertical curve to provide distance suited to
the location which in no case shall be less than 300 feet from a height of four
and one-half feet.
   (h)    Intersections. Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at an
angle of less than sixty degrees. Three-way intersections are encouraged, but
in no event shall an intersection containing streets in excess of four be
approved.
   (i)    Street Jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125
feet shall be prohibited. If deemed necessary by the Planning Commission, the
minimum distance between centerline offsets may be increased.
(Ord. 1981-99. Passed 8-24-81.)
   1181.03 EASEMENTS.
   (a)    Utility Easements. Electric and telephone lines should be located

side line.
   (b)    Drainage Easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a drainage
way, a storm water or drainage easement conforming substantially with the lines
of such drainage way shall be provided. The easement shall be twenty feet wide
or shall generally follow, but not be centered upon rear and side lot lines.
(Ord. 1981-99. Passed 8-24-81.)
   1181.04  BLOCKS.
   (a)    Residential Block Lengths. The long dimension of a residential block
shall not exceed 1,500 feet or be less than 800 feet.
   (b)    Pedestrian Walkways. Pedestrian walkways, with not less than a ten
foot wide right of way, or of such greater width as deemed necessary by the
Planning Commission, shall be required across blocks where the Planning
Commission deems that pedestrian access to schools, playgrounds, shopping
centers, transportation and other community facilities is necessary.
   (c)    Commercial or Industrial Blocks. Blocks intended to be used for
commercial or industrial purposes shall be designed specifically for such use
with adequate space set aside for off-street parking and loading facilities.
(Ord. 1981-99. Passed 8-24-81.)

   (a)    Zoning Conformance. The lot size, width, depth and the minimum
building setback lines shall conform to the existing City zoning regulations.
   (b)    Corner Lots. Corner lots shall have a side yard setback equivalent to
the front yard. (Ord. 1989-49. Passed 8-28-89.)
   (c)    Access to Public Streets. The subdividing of land shall provide each
lot with access to an existing public street.
   (d)    Double-Frontage Lot. Lots shall not be laid out so that they have
frontage on more than one street except: where the lots are adjacent to the
intersection of two streets; or where it is necessary to separate residential
lots from major arterial thoroughfares. Where double-frontage lots are created
adjacent to major arterial thoroughfares, a reserve strip along the major
arterial thoroughfare shall be deeded to the City. The plat shall state that
there shall be no right of access across such reserve strip. The Planning
Commission may require that a six foot high solid board fence or masonry wall
be constructed or that a ten foot wide planting screen be provided.
   (e)    Lot Lines. Lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial
to street lines. Lot lines should follow municipal, township and County
boundary lines rather than cross them insofar as possible. Lot lines shall not
be established within 100 feet of an existing oil, gas or brine well, or

(Ord. 2004-183. Passed 11-22-04.)
   (a)   Drainage. A drainage system shall be designed and constructed by the
subdivider to provide for the proper drainage of the surface water of the
subdivision and the drainage area of which it is a part. To this end the
subdivision shall be graded as required by Table 1 of Section
1183.01 and the following requirements and methods shall be followed:
      (1)    Drainage plan. Prior to the start of any construction, houses or
streets, the subdivider shall furnish a plat plan showing the slab or floor
elevation of each house proposed to be constructed. He shall also show by the
use of arrows how he proposes to surface drain each lot and furnish elevations
at lot corners and break in grade. The plan should indicate existing and
finished grades.
         The subdivider shall submit topographic maps showing the area to be
drained with calculations prepared by a registered professional engineer in
determining the proposed storm water collection system.
      (2)    Drainage requirements, grading. No final grading or sidewalk or
pavement construction or installation of utilities shall be permitted in any
proposed street until the plat has been approved or conditionally approved.
         The subdivider shall grade each subdivision as specified in Table 1 of
Section
1183.01 in order to establish street, block and lot grades in proper relation
to each other and to topography, as follows:
         A.    Street grading plan. A grading plan shall be prepared for the
streets along with street improvement details. The grading of the roadway shall
extend the full width of the right of way. Planting strips shall be graded at a
gradient of not less than two percent (2%) or more than three percent (3%)
upward from the curb to the sidewalk or property line.
            (Refer to Appendix H.)
         B.    Block and lot grading.
            1.    Block grading shall be as follows:
               a.    A ridge along rear lot lines, draining into the streets.
               b.    Parts of all lots draining to a sidewalk or ditch along
rear lot lines.
            2.    Lot grading shall be as follows:
               Lots shall be graded so that water drains away from each
building at a minimum grade of two percent (2%). Surface drainage swales shall
have a minimum grade of one-half percent (1/2%) and shall be designed so that
surface water shall drain into a driveway, street gutter, storm sewer, drain
inlet or natural drainage way. The minimum grades of driveways shall be four-
tenths percent (.4%) and a maximum of fifteen percent (15%).
         C.    Topsoil. If grading results in the stripping of topsoil, the
topsoil shall not be removed from the site or used as fill, but shall be saved
and uniformly spread over the lots as grading is finished.
         D.    Trees. As many trees as can be reasonably utilized in the final
development plan shall be retained and the grading adjusted to the existing
grade at the trees.
      (3)    Drainage system requirements. The design criteria for the drainage
systems shall be based on the correct State Department of Highways, Manual of
Location and Design. Runoff or design discharge for sewer design, where the
contributing area generally consists of pavement and a narrow strip back of the
pavement, shall be obtained from the rational formula: Q = Cia (See Manual of
Location and Design). Peak rates of runoff from watersheds under 1,000 acres
shall be obtained from the following formula: Q = RF x CF x FF x Q (See Manual
of Location and Design). The following minimum design frequencies are to be
used:
 
Roadway ditches        2 years
Storm sewers           10 years
Culvert under roadways 25 years
Watercourses           10 years
         A.    Road drainage system. The road storm drainage system shall serve
as the prime drainage system. It shall be designed to carry roadway, adjacent
land and house storm water drainage.
            1.    Road storm sewers, enclosed. The design discharge used to
determine pavement inlet spacing shall be based on the rational method
mentioned in subsection (a)(3) hereof. The gutter flow between inlets shall be
calculated by the equation: Q = .56 Z/NS 1/2F 8/3. (See Manual of Location and
Design) The inlet spacing shall be based on a two-year frequency, fifteen
minutes duration design storm. The spread of water on the pavement shall be
limited to eight feet into the traveled lane.
               In addition, standard manholes or combination manhold inlets for
cleaning purposes shall be placed no further than 300 feet apart.
         B.    Off-road drainage systems. The design of the off-road drainage
system shall include the watershed affecting the allotment and shall be
extended to a watercourse or ditch adequate to receive the storm drainage.
Enclosed storm sewer laterals of not less than four inches in diameter shall be
provided for each lot or building site and used for collection of sump pump
discharges. The flow shall not be included in calculations for subsection (a)
(3) hereof, but shall connect to the enclosed road storm sewers.
            1.    All watercourses or ditches with a design capacity not
exceeding the capacity of a thirty-six inch concrete pipe shall be enclosed.
               Existing creeks or ditches constructed by the subdivider which
exceed the above limit shall be constructed with a minimum fifteen foot wide
continuous earth roadway to provide access for maintenance equipment to all
sections of the ditch. The ditch easement shall be wide enough to contain the
ditch slopes and roadway with ample clearance for the operation of maintenance
equipment. Open ditches shall have a side slope ratio of two to one and a
minimum two foot bottom width.
            2.    Any storm drainage courses carried along side lot lines shall
be enclosed with approved pipe.
               a.    Drainage easement. Easements for drainage purposes shall
be a minimum of fifteen feet in width. Where the watercourse is large, easement
widths shall be increased as determined by the City Engineer (See subsection
(a)(3)B.2. hereof.) Where watercourses cross plotted lots diagonally, the
subdivider shall straighten such courses where practicable and shall
substantially follow sublot lines. Easements shall be shown on the record plat
and deeds and shall cover all existing or reconstructed watercourses.
         C.    Protection of drainage systems. The subdivider shall adequately
protect all ditches, roadways and watercourses to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer as follows:
            1.    Any watercourse having a gradient in excess of two and one-
half percent (2 1/2%) shall be enclosed with pipe with the necessary inlets and
shall be piped to a storm sewer, if nearby, or otherwise to a natural
watercourse. Where a street is of considerable length and of various gradients,
part of which require storm sewers, the lengths between the storm sewers even
though less than two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) gradient shall also be
enclosed in pipe, when required by the City Engineer. Material and construction
shall be in accordance with the specifications of the City Engineer.
Watercourses or road gutters having a gradient exceeding one and one-half
percent (1 1/2%) shall be sodded or paved with brick, concrete, half tile or
broken concrete slabs. All areas within the right of way not paved or sodded
shall be fertilized and seeded. All adjoining land where the vegetation has
been injured or destroyed or where the land is in need of protection to prevent
erosion, deposits in the drainage facilities and/or unsightly conditions shall
be restored and protected as directed by the City Engineer. In all cases, any
drainage facility within the subdivision shall be in a stable condition, free
from either erosion or sedimentation and/or other debris.
         D.    Pipe policy. The following pipe policy and the pipe policy of
the State Department of Highways, Construction and Material Specifications,
Items 706 and 707, shall be used in designing storm sewer systems subject to
the approval of the City Engineer.
            1.    All pipe lines, including culverts and storm sewers, which
are located beneath the roadway shall meet the requirements set forth for Class
A pipe.
            2.    Longitudinal storm sewer lines, not under the main roadways,
shall be Class D or Class E pipe. Where these sewers are shallow or located
beneath drives, Class B or Class C pipe shall be specified.
            3.    Longitudinal roadway drainage lines, for which sealed joints
are unnecessary or undesirable, shall be Class H pipes. Portions of these
drains that require stronger pipe because of shallow cover or location beneath
drives shall be Class C pipe.
            4.    Open end driveway pipe twenty-four inches or less in diameter
may be Class F pipe and larger pipes shall be Class B or Class C pipe.
            5.    Outlet pipe or open-joint drains, Class H or I, shall be in
accordance with the provisions of Class F pipe and shall usually be ten feet in
length.
            6.    Pipe underdrains shall be Class E pipe.
            7.    Pipe arches or elliptical pipes shall be Class G pipe.
   (b)    Street Improvements. The subdivider shall design and construct
pavements, curbs and gutters of sizes and types not less than set forth in
Appendix H for all streets. Pavement cross sections shall be as shown in
Appendix H. The construction and materials shall be as specified by the State
Department of Highways Construction and Material Specifications or as specified
by the City Engineer.
      (1)    Pavements. Higher standards and/or greater widths than indicated
herein may be required by the City Engineer or Planning Commission to
adequately provide for unusual soil conditions or extraordinary traffic volumes
or loads.
         After the underground utilities and house connections are installed
and rough grading completed, the roadway subgrade shall be shaped, rolled and
compacted. The subdivider may construct a temporary roadway of slag or stone
for use during the building construction period. Such pavements shall be
maintained in a safe and passable condition by the subdivider without expense
to the City.
      (2)    Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be provided as specified in the
required improvement schedule and in the location shown by the typical cross
section in Appendix H. Sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete four inches
thick with the thickness increased to seven inches where the sidewalk is
crossed by a driveway. The construction and materials shall be as specified in
Item 608 of the State Department of Highways Construction and Material
Specifications or as specified by the City Engineer.
      (3)    Street signs. The subdivider shall install a street sign showing
the names of all streets at all street intersections. The signs shall conform
to the specifications of the City Engineer and be mounted at a height of
approximately seven feet above the top of the curb or the crown of the
pavement. The sign shall be located as directed by the City Engineer.
         A.    Street name signs, of a type in use throughout the City, shall
be erected by the subdivider at all intersections.
         B.    For purposes of street naming, the following suffixes shall
apply:
            1.    Avenue shall be used only for streets that run in a generally
east-west direction;
            2.    Boulevard or Drive shall be used only for a large meandering
type street;
            3.    Circle or Court shall be used only for cul-de-sac type
streets that run in a generally east-west direction;
            4.    Lane or Place shall be used for cul-de-sac type streets that
run in a generally north-south direction;
            5.   Road or Way shall be used only for streets that run in a
diagonal manner, either a generally north-west-southeast direction or a
northeast-southwest direction;
            6.    Street shall be used only for thoroughfares that run in a
generally north-south direction;
            7.    The words north, south, east or west should be avoided as
part of a street name whenever possible.
         C.    Whenever a new street is constructed along the approximate
alignment or extension of an existing street, its name shall be the same as
that of the existing one.
         D.    Whenever a street alignment changes direction more than seventy-
five degrees without a return to the original alignment within a distance of
500 feet, then the name of the street shall be changed at the point of
curvature.
         E.    Whenever a cul-de-sac street serves not more than three lots,
the name of the intersecting street shall apply to the cul-de-sac.
         F.    To avoid duplication and confusion, the proposed names of all
streets shall be approved by the City Engineer prior to such names being
assigned or used.
         G.    Stop signs, safety, speed limit and information signs shall be
to local standards and installed at the direction of the Engineer.
      (4)    Street lights and underground utility lines. In all new allotments
or reallotments, all utility lines including those for street lighting, shall
be installed underground. All owners or petitioners for subdivision of land
shall grant easements for such lines and areas as are needed by the utilities
for installation, maintenance and replacement of their lines and needed
equipment including street lighting.
         The subdivider shall include a restrictive covenant in the plat to
allow for the agreement of property owner/purchasers/grantees or assignees to
assessment installation and operation and maintenance of street lighting as
deemed appropriate by Council resolution of necessity.
      (5)    Street trees. The trees shall be provided only on streets with
curbs and gutters as required in the improvement schedule and as follows:
         A.    Species. The trees shall be species which are resistant to
damage and disease and which do not cause interference with underground
utilities or street lighting.
            The species of trees suggested are Red Maple, Norway Maple, Sugar

branches, unpleasant odors, excessively thick foliage, susceptibility to
disease or attack by insects, or large root systems such as Poplar, Willow,
Cottonwood, American Elm, Ailanthus, Mountain Ash, Silver Maple, Ash Leaved
Maple and Oregon Maple are prohibited in the planting strip. Poplar, Willow or
Cottonwood trees, if planted on private property, shall be located not less
than 100 feet from any public sewer.
         B.    Location. Street trees shall be spaced so that there shall be
one per lot, but not in excess of eighty feet on center. No trees shall be
planted within forty feet of the intersection of two street right-of-way lines.
Approaches to buildings should be considered when locating trees.
         C.   Tree Size. Trees shall be at least one and one-half inches in
diameter one foot above the ground. Lowest branches shall be not less than
seven feet and no more than ten feet above the ground.
      (6)    Planting screens or fences. The Planning Commission may require
and permit planting screens or fences where reverse frontage lots abut a major
arterial street or between a major arterial thoroughfare and a marginal access
street, provided that such planting screens or fences shall not constitute a
safety hazard. A plan of proposed planting screens or fences shall be submitted
for approval with the plat.
   (c)    Sewer and Water Facilities. Adequate central sanitary sewer,
including manholes, house laterals and other incidentals and water supply
systems, shall be provided by the subdivider, either by the installation of new
systems or by connection to existing systems which are deemed adequate by the
City Engineer to handle the additional demands and volume which shall result
from the proposed subdivision. The subdivider, prior to the submission of the
plat for approval by the Planning Commission, shall receive the prior written
approval for the extension or installation of the central water system and
central sanitary sewer system from the City Engineer, the State Department of
Health, and particular private or public utilities involved. All sanitary sewer

      (Ord. 1982-119. Passed 12-20-82.)
   (d)    Public Sites
      (1)    The Planning Commission may require the dedication of land for
parks, playgrounds, open space and/or school sites and shall require the
developer to pay a fee per family unit to the Parks and Recreation Board
pursuant to the Parks and Recreation's Master Plan to facilitate the
development of said plan.
         This fee shall be in accordance with the fee structure as set forth
under Chapter
149, Fees and Permit Charges (Section
149.09). These provisions shall apply to all major and minor subdivisions,
single or multi-family improvements, apartments, condominiums and planned unit
developments.
         Acceptance of any land is contingent on Council action to accept on
behalf of the City, and further does not exempt one from the requirements of
Section
149.09 unless the proposed development is a non-residential commercial
development, private recreation park, business property and/or industrial
development. It is further required that any funds received by the Park Board
pursuant to this section be restricted for Capital Improvements only.
      (2)    Lands dedicated to the City for public sites may have multiple
uses, including 10 year flood plain, setback; requirements for wells, and
preservation of archaeological sites, at the discretion of the Planning
Commission.
      (3)    The designation of a private park within the boundaries of the
lands proposed shall not exempt the applicant from the requirements of these
Public Site provisions.
      (4)    At the discretion of the Planning Commission, public sites may be
designated for schools whereby the multiple uses listed in subsection (d)(2)
hereof shall not apply. It is recommended that public sites for schools be at
least ten acres in area; sites for neighborhood parks be at least seven acres,
and school-park sites be at least fifteen acres in area. It is also recommended
that public sites adjoining subdivisions should be located together so that
larger, more useable sites are created.
      (5)    The applicant shall submit improvement plans for the public site
to the Planning Commission at the time of site plan or plat submittal. Public
Site improvements may include all weather access, ground clearing and shaping,
drainage, seeding, landscaping, parking, sport apparatus, fencing and lighting
as deemed appropriate by the Planning Commission.
      (6)   The Planning Commission may elect to cause the applicant to engage
the services of an approved professional archeologist to survey the land and
inventory archaeologically sensitive areas. Such areas may be required to be
set aside as a public site at the Planning Commission's discretion. At the
conclusion of archaeological salvaging, the site may revert to the applicant's
use or a public site as determined by the archeologist's report and the
applicant's and Planning Commission's agreement.
         (Ord. 1994-27. Passed 3-28-94.)
         No zoning permit shall be issued without the dwelling unit park fee
being on deposit with the City Finance Director and the public site legal
boundary description or plat, signed by the property owner, transferred to the
City Engineer, for presentation to and acceptance by Council.
         (Ord. 1986-101. Passed 12-22-86.)
   (e)    Monuments.
      (1)    Monuments shall be one inch pipe or steel rods set in and running
through a concrete block at least six inches in diameter and at least thirty
inches long and the bottom of such block shall be set at least thirty inches
deep, below finished grade in the plat, and the points at which they may be
found shall be designated on the plat. All monuments set in pavements shall be
set in standard type monument boxes. Where new streets intersect existing
highways, monuments may be placed on the centerline of the new road at the
right of way of the existing road.
      (2)    Four monuments shall be set in each plat of ten lots or less, and
not less than six shall be set in each plat containing over ten lots. Iron pins
shall be set at all lot corners and in all changes in lot line direction and at
the P.C. and P.T. of all right-of-way curves.
         (Ord. 1982-119. Passed 12-20-82.)
   1183.02 OVERSIZE AND/OR OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS. 
   Oversize and/or off-site extensions of utilities, pavements and other
improvements shall be designed and constructed to facilitate the orderly
development of nearby land which is an integral part of the neighborhood
service or drainage area. Where the City Engineer determines that improvements
in excess of the size needed to serve the proposed subdivision are necessary,
the subdivider shall install all improvements required to serve his subdivision
plus the additional oversize and/or off-site improvements required. The
subdivider may contract with adjacent property owners and/or subdividers of
adjacent land for reimbursement of the oversize and/or off-site improvements
required. Such improvements shall be available for connections by individual
property owners and/or subdividers of adjoining land.
(Ord. 1982-119. Passed 12-20-82.)
   1183.03  CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS. 
   (a)    Preconstruction Meeting and Work Schedule. A preconstruction meeting
shall be held with the City Engineer prior to the commencement of any project.
At this time the project shall be discussed in regard to procedure, plans,
materials and inspections.

   1191.01 COMPREHENSIVE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   The Riparian and Wetland Setback Plan developed to meet this regulation will
be coordinated and combined with the Post-Construction Water Quality Plan and
the Construction Site Conservation Plan that are developed for the same site.
These plans will be titled and numbered in one consecutive sequence to make a
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan for the site. The Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plan so developed will serve as the Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part of the NPDES Storm Water
Permit for General Construction.
(Ord. 2009-73. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1191.02 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The intent of this regulation is to:
      (1)   Protect the receiving stream's physical, chemical, and biological
characteristics and to maintain stream functions.
      (2)   Establish consistent, technically feasible and operationally
practical standards to achieve a level of storm water quantity and quality
control that will minimize damage to public and private property and
degradation of water resources, and will promote and maintain the health,
safety, and welfare of the residents of the Community.
      (3)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the community and building sites and minimize the need to
construct, repair, maintain, and replace enclosed storm drain systems.
      (4)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
ground water recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water
resources, wetlands, and wells.
      (5)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil,
especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands.
      (6)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance, costly mitigation, and
repairs to roads, embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources,
wetlands, and storm water management practices that are the result of
inadequate storm water control due to the loss of riparian areas and wetlands.
      (7)   Reduce the long term expense of remedial projects needed to address
problems caused by inadequate storm water control.
         (Ord. 2009-73. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1191.03 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.

maintain a private or public nuisance on his or her property. Compliance with
the provisions of this regulation shall not be a defense in any action to abate
such nuisance.
   (d)   Failure of the Community to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the
owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting there from,
and shall not result in the Community, its officers, employees, or agents being
responsible for any condition or damage resulting there from. (Ord. 2009-73.

(Ord. 2009-73. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1191.09 RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACK REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that the system of wetlands, riparian areas,
rivers, streams, and other natural watercourses within the Community
contributes to the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents. The
specific purpose and intent of this part of these regulations is to regulate
uses and developments within riparian and wetland setbacks that would impair
the ability of riparian and wetland areas to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of floodwaters, and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Assist in stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce bank
erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourse
banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling,
transforming and absorbing pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses.
      (5)   Provide watercourse habitats with shade and food.
      (6)   Provide habitat to a wide array of aquatic organisms, wildlife,
many of which are on Ohio's Endangered and/or Threatened Species listings, by
maintaining diverse and connected riparian and wetland vegetation.
      (7)   Benefit the Community economically by minimizing encroachment on
wetlands and watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering solutions
such as dams, retention basins, and rip rap to protect structures and reduce
property damage and threats to the safety of residents; provide free water
absorption, filtration and well recharge; and by contributing to the scenic
beauty and environment of the Community, and thereby preserving the character
of the Community, the quality of life of the residents of the Community, and
corresponding property values.
   (b)   The following regulations have been enacted to protect these services
of riparian and wetland areas by providing reasonable controls governing
structures and uses within a wetland and/or riparian setback along designated
watercourses in the Community.
   (c)   Applicability and Compliance:
      (1)   These regulations shall apply to:
         A.   All lands that are within the jurisdiction of the Community and
that border designated watercourses and wetlands as defined in these
regulations.
         B.   These regulations shall apply to property/parcel split plan
approvals, site plan approvals, and land development plan approvals requested
of the Community.
         C.   These regulations shall apply to all building permits, which
involve soil disturbing activities.
      (2)   The Community shall issue no approvals or permits without full
compliance with the terms of these regulations.
         (Ord. 2009-73. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1191.10 ESTABLISHMENT OF DESIGNATED WATERCOURSES AND RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Pursuant to Ordinance 2011-06, passed January 24, 2011
Council has enacted Riparian Setback Map. Copies are on file with the Clerk of
Council.)
   (a)   Designated watercourses addressed by this ordinance are those which
meet the definition of "stream" of these regulations and are indicated on at
least one of the following maps (most recent edition):
      (1)   USGS topographical map.
      (2)   Portage County/City of Streetsboro Riparian map
      (3)   Soils maps located in the Soil Survey for Portage County, Ohio,
USDA, NRCS.
 
   (b)   Riparian setbacks on designated watercourses are established as
follows:
      (1)   A minimum of 300 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 300 square miles.
      (2)   A minimum of 100 feet on both sides of all watercourses draining an
area greater than 20 square miles and up to 300 square miles.
      (3)   A minimum of 75 feet on both sides of all watercourses draining an
area greater than one half square mile (320 acres) and up to 20 square miles.
      (4)   A minimum of 50 feet on both sides of all watercourses draining an
area greater than 0.05 square miles (32 acres) and up to one half square mile
(320 acres).
      (5)   A minimum of 25 feet on both sides of all watercourses draining an
area less than 0.05 square miles (32 acres).
 
   (c)   Riparian Setback Map:
      (1)   The Community shall use the latest edition of the official soil
survey that shows drainage features, as the map identifying designated
watercourses and their riparian setbacks. The drainage features identified on
the paper maps in the official soil survey and the information contained
therein shall be believed to be accurate.
      (2)   At the time of application of this regulation, if any discrepancy
is found between the Riparian Setback Map and the criteria for designated
watercourses or riparian setbacks as set forth in these regulations, the
criteria shall prevail.
      (3)   In reviewing and interpreting the maps the Community may consult
with a representative of the local county SWCD and other technical experts as
necessary.
 
   (d)   The following conditions shall apply in riparian and wetland setbacks:
      (1)   Riparian and wetland setbacks shall be measured in a perpendicular
and horizontal direction outward from the ordinary high water mark of each
designated watercourse and defined wetland boundary.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in this regulation, riparian and
wetland setbacks shall be preserved in their natural state and shall be
established and marked in the field prior to any soil disturbing or land
clearing activities.
      (3)   Where the 100-year floodplain is wider than a riparian setback on
either or both sides of a designated watercourse, the riparian setback shall be
extended to the outer edge of the 100-year floodplain. The 100-year floodplain
shall be determined by the project engineer conducting a hydrologic analysis of
the project area in conformance with standard engineering practices and
approved by the Engineering Director and/or his or her designees. The 100-year
floodplain shall be defined by FEMA.
      (4)   Where wetlands are identified within a riparian setback, the
minimum riparian setback width shall be extended to the outer boundary of the
wetland. In addition, wetlands shall be protected to the extent detailed in
these regulations.
      (5)   Wetlands shall be delineated by a site survey approved by the
Community using delineation protocols accepted by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and the Ohio EPA at the time of application of this regulation. If a
conflict exists between the delineation protocols of these two agencies, the
delineation protocol that results in the most inclusive area of wetland shall
apply. All wetland delineations shall also include the latest version of the
Ohio Rapid Assessment Method for wetland evaluation approved at the time of
application of the regulations.
 
   (e)   The applicant or his or her designated representative shall be
responsible for delineating riparian and wetland setbacks, including any
expansions or modifications as required by these regulations, and identifying
these setbacks on all property/parcel splits, commercial development or other
land development plans, and/or building permit applications submitted to the
Community. This delineation may be done by a metes and bounds, or higher level,
survey and shall be subject to review and approval by the Community. As a
result of this review, the Community may consult with a representative of the
local county SWCD or other technical experts as necessary.
 
   (f)   Prior to any soil disturbing activity, the Riparian Setback shall be
clearly delineated with construction fencing or other suitable material by the
applicant on site, and such delineation shall be maintained throughout soil-
disturbing activities. The delineated area shall be maintained in an
undisturbed state unless permitted by these regulations. All fencing shall be
removed when a development project is completed.
 
   (g)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the Community prior to on-
site delineation of riparian and wetland setbacks in conformance with these
regulations.
 
   (h)   Upon completion of an approved property/parcel split, land
development, or other improvement, riparian and wetland setbacks shall be
permanently recorded on the plat records of the Community.
 
   (i)   The following are exempt from the terms and protection of this
ordinance: grassy swales, roadside ditches, drainage ditches created at the
time of a subdivision to convey storm water to another system, tile drainage
systems and stream culverts.
 
   (j)   Because the gradient of the riparian corridor significantly influences
impacts on the stream, the following adjustment for steep slopes will be
integrated into the Riparian Setback formulae for width determination:
 
Average Percent Slope        Width of Setback
15% through 20%              Add 25 feet
Greater than 20% through 25% Add 50 feet
Greater than 25%             Add 100 feet
 
   Average percent slope of the stream bank is to be calculated for the area
within the Riparian Setback and is to be measured as a line perpendicular to
the stream channel at the location where structures or uses are proposed in the
plan.
(Ord. 2009-73. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1191.11 ESTABLISHMENT OF WETLAND SETBACKS.
   Wetland setbacks are established as follows:
   (a)   A minimum of 120 feet surrounding and including all Ohio EPA Category
3 Wetlands, or current equivalent Ohio EPA classification.
   (b)   A minimum of 75 feet surrounding and including all Ohio EPA Category 2
Wetlands, or current equivalent Ohio EPA classification.
   (c)   A minimum of 25 feet surrounding and including all Ohio EPA Category 1
Wetlands, or current equivalent Ohio EPA classification.
      (Ord. 2009-73. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1191.12 PROCEDURE FOR WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   No change to parcel boundaries or land use:
      (1)   Upon filing a request for a building permit that does not involve
changing of any parcel boundaries or changes in land use, the applicant will
check for indicators of wetlands on the National Wetlands Inventory maps, and
Ohio Wetlands Inventory map, and the Portage County Wetlands Inventory (if
applicable). A photocopy of the applicable section of each map will be attached
to the permit application.
      (2)   If a potential wetland is shown on any of the maps or if there is
reason for the Community to believe that an unmapped wetland exists including
but not limited to vernal pools, wet woods, or any well water re-charge areas,
or on or within 50 feet of the project site the applicant will retain a
qualified wetland professional to evaluate the proposed project site for
wetlands or wetland buffer areas. If no wetland or wetland buffer areas are
found, the applicant shall submit a letter from the qualified wetland
professional with the preliminary plat or permit application verifying his or
her negative findings.
 
   (b)   New residential or commercial or other type development and projects
involving a change to parcel boundaries or a land use change:
      (1)   Upon filing a request for approval of a preliminary plat or
building permit for new residential, commercial or other type of development
that involves changes in any parcel boundaries or changes in land use, the
applicant or his or her designated representative shall retain a qualified
wetland professional to survey the proposed development site for wetlands. If
no wetlands are found, the applicant or his or her designated representative
shall submit a letter with the preliminary plat or permit application verifying
that a qualified wetland professional has surveyed the site and found no
wetlands. If wetlands are found, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (2)   A qualified wetland professional, acceptable to the Engineering
Director and/or his or her designees, shall determine the presence of Ohio EPA
Category 1, 2 or 3 wetlands (or current equivalent Ohio EPA classification) on
the proposed development site using the latest version of the Ohio Rapid
Assessment Method for wetland evaluation approved at the time of application of
this regulation. Acceptance of this determination shall be subject to approval
by the Engineering Director and/or his or her designees.
      (3)   If Ohio EPA Category 1, 2 or 3 wetlands (or current equivalent Ohio
EPA classification) are located on the proposed development site, the applicant
or his or her designated representative shall delineate these wetlands and the
wetland setback in conformance with these regulations. The applicant or his or
her designated representative shall identify all delineated wetlands and their
associated setbacks on all property/parcel split plans, land development plans,
and/or permit applications submitted to the Community.
         A.   Wetlands shall be delineated by a site survey, approved by the
Community, using delineation protocols accepted by the US Army Corps of
Engineers and the Ohio EPA at the time of application of this regulation. If
conflict exists between the delineation protocols of these two agencies, the
delineation protocol that results in the most inclusive area of wetland shall
apply.
         B.   Wetland setbacks shall be delineated through a metes and bounds,
or higher level, survey subject to approval by the Community.
      (4)   Prior to any soil or vegetation disturbing activity, the applicant
or his or her designated representative shall delineate wetland setbacks on the
development site in such a way that they can be clearly viewed, and such
delineation shall be maintained throughout construction.
      (5)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the Community prior to
delineation of wetland setbacks in conformance with this regulation.
 
   (c)   Upon completion of an approved property/parcel split, commercial
development or other land development or improvement, riparian and wetland
setbacks shall be permanently recorded on the plat records for the Community
and shall be maintained as open space thereafter.
(Ord. 2009-73. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1191.13 USES PERMITTED IN RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   By-Right Uses Without a Permit: Open space uses that are passive in
character shall be permitted in riparian and wetland setbacks, including, but
not limited to, those listed in these regulations. No use permitted under these
regulations shall be construed as allowing public trespass on privately held
lands.
      (1)   Recreational Activity. Passive recreational uses, as permitted by
federal, state, and local laws, such as hiking, non-motorized bicycling,
fishing, hunting, picnicking, and similar uses and associated structures
including boardwalks, pathways constructed of pervious material, picnic tables,
and wildlife viewing areas.
      (2)   Removal of Storm Damaged or Diseased Trees. Storm Damaged or
diseased trees may be removed. Because of the potential for storm damaged
braches to damage downstream properties and/or block ditches or otherwise
exacerbate flooding, new logs and branches resulting from the removal of
damaged or diseased trees that are greater than 6 inches in diameter, shall be
anchored to the shore or removed from the 100-year floodplain. Existing downed
logs and braches help stabilize the soil and should not be moved.
      (3)   Revegetation and/or Reforestation. The revegetation and/or
reforestation of the Riparian Setback shall be allowed without approval of the
Portage SWCD. Native Species of shrubs and plants are recommended for
stabilizing flood prone areas along streams within the City of Streetsboro are
listed in the Appendix.
      (4)   Maintenance of lawns, gardens and landscaping: Lawns, gardens and
landscaping, that existed at the time this ordinance was passed, may be
maintained as long as they are not increased in size, or having increased
amounts of fertilizer, pesticides and/or herbicides.
 
   (b)   The following uses are permitted by right within the Riparian Setbacks
with prior approval of the design:
      (1)   Stream bank Stabilization/Erosion Control Measures. Best Management
Practices (BMP's) for stream bank stabilization or erosion control may be
allowed if such practices are within permitted uses by the local, state, and
federal government regulations and are ecologically compatible and emphasize
the use of natural materials and native plant species where practical and
available. Such stream bank stabilization/erosion control practices shall only
be undertaken upon approval of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP
or SW3P) by the Portage SWCD.
      (2)   Crossings. In reviewing plans for stream crossings, the City may
confer with the Portage SWCD, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Natural Areas; the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, Division
of Surface Water; the County of Portage Engineer; the Portage County Water
Resources Department; the Portage County Health Department; or other technical
experts as necessary.
         A.   Limited crossings of designated streams through the Riparian
Setback by vehicles, storm sewers, sewer and/or water lines, and public utility
lines will be per the approval of local, county, and state governing agencies
and as a part of the regular subdivision review process.
         B.   One driveway crossing per stream per tax parcel will be allowed
for an individual landowner.
         C.   Roadway crossings for major and minor subdivisions, open space
subdivisions, or any other non-single family residential use shall be designed
and constructed per the City of Streetsboro Engineer's design standards and as
approved by the City of Streetsboro Planning Commission. If more than two
crossings per 1,000 lineal feet of stream center are required for these areas,
the applicant must apply for a variance.
         D.   All roadway crossings shall be perpendicular to the stream flow
and shall minimize disturbance to the Riparian Setback and shall mitigate any
necessary disturbances.
      (3)   Placement of storm water retention or detention facilities may be
considered within the Riparian Setback if:
         A.   Storm water quality treatment that is consistent with current
state standards is incorporated into the basin.
         B.   The storm water quality treatment basin is located at least 50
feet from the ordinary high water mark of the stream.
            (Ord. 2009-73. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1191.14 USES PROHIBITED IN RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS.
   Any use not authorized under these regulations shall be prohibited in
riparian and wetland setbacks. By way of example, the following uses are
specifically prohibited; however, prohibited uses are not limited to those
examples listed here.
   (a)   Construction. There shall be no structures of any kind, except as
permitted under these regulations.
   (b)   Dredging or Dumping. There shall be no drilling for petroleum or

with these regulations; for such disturbances as are approved under these
regulations; and for the passive enjoyment, access and maintenance of
landscaping or lawns existing at the time of passage of these regulations.
      Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a landowner to
plant or undertake any other activities in the Riparian Setback provided the
landowner allows natural succession of native species.
   (f)   Parking Lots. There shall be no parking lots or other human-made
impervious cover, except as permitted under these regulations.
   (g)   New Surface and/or Subsurface Sewage Disposal or Treatment Areas.
Riparian and wetland setbacks shall not be used for the disposal or treatment
of sewage except in accordance with local county Board of Health regulations in

      (Ord. 2009-73. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1191.15  NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES OR USES IN RIPARIAN AND/OR WETLAND
SETBACKS.
   (a)   Structures and uses within the Riparian and/or Wetland Setbacks,
existing at the time of passage of these regulations, that are not permitted
under these regulations may be continued but shall not be expanded except as
set forth in this title.
 
   (b)   If damaged or destroyed, these structures or uses may be repaired or
restored within two years from the date of damage/destruction or the adoption
of these regulations, whichever is later, at the property owners own risk.
 
   (c)   A residential structure or use within the Riparian and/or Wetland
Setback existing at the time of passage of these regulations may be expanded
subject to the provisions of (1) through (3) below:
      (1)   The expansion conforms to existing zoning regulations.
      (2)   The expansion must not impact the stream channel or the 100-year
flood plain.

existing structure or use that lies within the Riparian and/or Wetland setback.
Expansions exceeding 15% of the footprint within the Riparian and/or Wetland
Setback must be obtained through the variance process.
 
   (d)   A non-conforming structure or use that is discontinued may be resumed
any time within six (6) months from such discontinuance but not thereafter. No
change or resumption shall be permitted that is more detrimental to riparian
and wetland setbacks, as measured against the intent and objectives of these
regulations as determined by the Community, than the existing or former non-
conforming structure or use.
(Ord. 2009-73. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1191.16 VARIANCES WITHIN RIPARIAN AND/OR WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   The Community may grant a variance from this regulation as provided
herein. In determining whether there is unnecessary hardship or practical
difficulty such as to justify the granting of a variance, the Community shall
consider the potential harm or reduction in riparian and/or wetland area
functions that may be caused by a proposed structure or use. The Board of
Zoning and Building Appeals may consult with representatives from the Portage
SWCD; the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Natural Areas; the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Surface Water; the County
Engineer; the Portage County Water Resource Department; the Portage County
Health Department; or other technical experts as necessary to consider variance
requests.
 
   (b)   Expansions of residential structures or uses exceeding 15% of the
footprint area and expansions of all non-residential structures or uses are
subject to provisions (1) through (4) below:
      (1)   The expansion conforms to the existing zoning regulations.
      (2)   The expansion must not impact the stream channel, wetlands or the
100-year floodplain.
      (3)   The expansion of a non-residential structure or use must not affect
upstream or downstream hydrologic conditions which could cause damage from
flooding or stream bank erosion to landowners in those areas. The hydrologic
study must be completed by non-residential applicants only as a process of the
variance application.
      (4)   The expansion of a non-residential structure or use will not exceed
25% of the footprint area. The 25% expansion limit is per the portion of the
structure or use that lies within the Riparian Setback.
 
   (c)   Requests for variances for subdivisions will be considered for the
following:
      (1)   An additional stream crossing or crossings for a subdivision or
open space development which is necessary for the health, welfare, and safety
of the residents of the subdivision.
      (2)   A reduction of the setback width, not to exceed 10% of the
prescribed Riparian Setback width.
 
   (d)   No variances shall be granted for expansion of the following
structures or uses:
      (1)   Facilities which use, store, distribute, or sell petroleum-based
products or any hazardous materials. Such facilities include, but are not
limited to: asphalt plants, dry cleaners, gasoline services, and road
maintenance facilities.
      (2)   Facilities which use, store, distribute, or sell products which may
contribute higher than acceptable concentrations of dissolved or particulate
matter to storm water runoff around the facility. Such facilities include, but
are not limited to: landfills or transfer stations, junk yards, recycling
facilities, quarries and borrow pits, sand and gravel extraction operations,
and road salt storage barns.
 
   (e)   In making a variance determination, the Community shall consider the
following:
      (1)   Varying the front, rear and side yard setback before the riparian
and wetland setbacks are varied.
      (2)   Variances should not be granted for asphalt or concrete paving in
the riparian and wetland setbacks in any situation where gravel or porous
pavement (i.e., porous pavers, and similar products) will do the job.
 
   (f)   In making a variance determination, the Community may consider the
following:
      (1)   A parcel existing at the time of passage of this chapter is made
unbuildable.
      (2)   The soil type natural vegetation of the parcel, as well as the
percentage of the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain. The criteria of
the Community's flood damage prevention regulations may be used as guidance
when granting variances in the 100-year floodplain.
      (3)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, soil erosion control, sediment control, water quality protection, or
other functions of the riparian and/or wetland area. This determination shall
be based on sufficient technical and scientific data.
      (4)   The degree of hardship this regulation places on the landowner, and
the availability of alternatives to the proposed activity.
      (5)   Soil disturbing activities permitted in a riparian and/or wetland
setback through variances should be implemented in order to minimize clearing
to the extent possible, and to include Best Management Practices necessary to
minimize soil erosion and maximize sediment control.
      (6)   The presence of significant impervious cover, or smooth vegetation
such as maintained lawns, in riparian setback areas compromises their benefits
to the Community.
      (7)   A reduction in storm water infiltration into the soil in wetland
areas will occur.
      (8)   A requested above ground fence does not increase the existing area
of mowed grass or lawn.
      (9)   Modifying parking requirements before varying the riparian setback.
      (10)   Modifying building shape, size or design to avoid or minimize
intrusion into the riparian setback.
      (11)   In the case of a lot made unbuildable by this regulation, consider
the minimum variance needed to make it buildable for an appropriately sized and
compatibly designed structure, while following the guidance provided in this
section.
      (12)   Whether the variance will increase the likelihood for flooding or
erosion damage to either the applicant's property or to other properties.
      (13)   Culverting of watercourses should be avoided.
      (14)   Whether the variance will result in the need for artificial slope
or bank stabilization measures that could interfere with the functions of the
riparian zone.
 
   (g)   When a variance is granted that results in a loss of riparian or
wetland function, that loss must be mitigated according to the following:
      (1)   If the loss will result in increased flooding, stream bank erosion,
or in-stream sedimentation, the loss shall be mitigated at the site or upstream
of the site in the same watershed.
      (2)   If biological functions are the only loss, mitigation will occur
upstream whenever feasible. If not, a downstream site will be sought. If no
suitable mitigation sites can be found on the affected stream, a site located
anywhere in the community shall be selected.
      (3)   All wetland losses must be mitigated upstream of the disturbed
locations.
      (4)   Mitigation or riparian and wetland setback losses shall consist of
a minimum of 150% of the area disturbed by the variance granted.
      (5)   Mitigation of actual wetland losses shall be at the rate of 150% of
the area lost by the variance granted.
      (6)   Mitigation of wetland setback losses can occur at any previously
impacted site in the community or in an upstream tributary area outside of the
community.
      (7)   Prior to granting any variance that results in a loss of riparian
or wetland function or wetland area, the applicant must submit a statement that
identifies all requested losses, an evaluation of mitigation needs and
documentation of the planned mitigation to offset the losses; this statement
will be submitted to Ohio EPA at part of the community's Annual Storm Water
Program Report.
      (8)   Prior to granting any variance that results in a loss of riparian
or wetland function or wetland area, the applicant must submit a statement that
legally binds the applicant to complete, at his or her personal expense, any
future mitigation and to pay any penalties or fines that may be assessed or
assigned to the community by any regulatory authority relative to the granting
of any of the applicants requested variances under this ordinance.
      (9)   Completion of all mitigation projects resulting from the granting

under this regulation may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 2009-73. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1191.18 INSPECTION OF RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACK.
   (a)   The delineation of riparian and/or wetland setbacks shall be inspected
by the Community, as follows:
      (1)   Prior to any soil disturbing activities authorized by the Community
for a property/parcel split, land development plan, and/or building permit. The
applicant or his or her designated representative shall provide the Community
with at least five (5) working days notice prior to starting soil disturbing or
land clearing activities.
      (2)   Prior to starting any of the activities authorized by the Community
under the uses permitted in riparian and wetland setbacks section of these
regulations, the applicant or his or her designated representative shall
provide the Community with at least five (5) working days notice prior to
starting such activities.
      (3)   Any time evidence is brought to the attention of the Community that
uses or structures are occurring that may reasonably be expected to violate the
provisions of these regulations.
         (Ord. 2009-73. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1191.19 VIOLATIONS.
   No person shall violate, or cause, or knowingly permit to be violated, any
of the provisions of these regulations, or fail to comply with any such
provisions or with any lawful requirements of any public authority made
pursuant to these regulations, or knowingly use or cause or permit the use of
any lands in violation of these regulations or in violation of any permit
granted under these regulations.
(Ord. 2009-73. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1191.99 PENALTIES.
   (a)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any provision of this
regulation is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined no
more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisoned for no more than one
hundred eighty (180) days, or both, for each offense.
 
   (b)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues.
 
   (c)   Upon notice from the Engineering Director and/or his or her designees,
or designated representative, that work is being performed contrary to this
regulation, such work shall immediately stop. Such notice shall be in writing
and shall be given to the owner or person responsible for the development area,
or person performing the work, and shall state the conditions under which such
work may be resumed; provided, however, in instances where immediate action is
deemed necessary for public safety or the public interest, the Engineering
Director and/or his or her designees may require that work be stopped upon
verbal order pending issuance of the written order.
 
   (d)   The imposition of any other penalties provided herein shall not
preclude the Community, by or through its Law Director and/or any of his or her
assistants, from instituting an appropriate action or proceeding in a Court of
Proper Jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful development or to restrain, correct
or abate a violation, or to require compliance with the provisions of this
regulation or other applicable laws, or ordinances, rules or regulations or the
orders of the Engineering Director and/or his or her designees.

*High Flood Tolerance: Generally lowland wet species surviving when flooded or
exposed to high water table more 40% of the growing season.
*Moderate Flood Tolerance: Generally lowland wet species surviving when
flooding or exposed to high water table more than 30% of the growing season but
less than 40%.
*Intermediate Flood Tolerance:  Generally lowland wet-mesic species surviving
occasional inundation or elevated water table between 20% and 30% of the
growing season.
*Low Flood Tolerance: Generally upland mesic and mesic-dry species rarely
inundated or exposed to an elevated water table for periods of short duration,
between 5% and 20% of the growing season.
*No Flood Tolerance: Generally upland dry species exhibiting immediate and
rapid decline frequently culminating in death if inundated or exposed to
elevated water table for more than 5% of the growing season.
**Shade Tolerance: Shade tolerance means able to grow in a state of health and
vigor beneath dense shade. In this ranking, shrubs and vines are ranked on a
scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very shade tolerant, and 5 being very shade
intolerant.

   1193.01  COMPREHENSIVE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   The Construction Site Conservation Plan developed to meet this regulation
will be coordinated and combined with the Riparian and Wetland Setback Plan and
the Post-Construction Water Quality Plan that are developed for the same site.
These plans will be titled and numbered in one consecutive sequence to make a
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan for the site. The Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plan so developed will serve as the Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part of the NPDES Storm Water
Permit for General Construction.
(Ord. 2009-74. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1193.02 PURPOSE.
   The intent of this regulation is to establish consistent technically
feasible and operationally practical standards to achieve a level of storm
water management, and erosion and sediment control that will minimize damage to
public and private property and the degradation of water resources, and will
promote and maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the
Community.
   This regulation further intends, but is not limited, to:
   (a)   Allow development while minimizing increases in downstream flooding,
erosion, and sedimentation.
   (b)   Reduce damage to receiving water resources and drainage systems that
are caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
   (c)   Control storm water runoff resulting from soil disturbing activities.
   (d)   Assure that development site owners control the volume and rate of
storm water runoff originating from their property so that surface water and
ground water are protected, soil erosion is controlled, and flooding potential
is not increased.
   (e)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the building site and minimize the need to construct,
repair, and replace enclosed storm drain systems.
   (f)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water
resources, wetlands, and wells.
   (g)   Assure that storm water controls are incorporated into site planning
and design at the earliest possible stage.
   (h)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil,
especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands.
   (i)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and storm
water management practices that are the result of inadequate soil erosion,
sediment and storm water control.
   (j)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to address
problems caused by inadequate storm water, erosion and sediment control.
   (k)   Require the construction of storm water management practices that
serve multiple purposes including flood control, soil erosion and sediment
control, and require water quality protection; and encourage such practices
that promote recreation and habitat preservation.
   (l)   Ensure that all storm water management, soil erosion and sediment
control practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.
      (Ord. 2009-74. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1193.03 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   Neither submission of a plan under the provisions herein, nor compliance
with the provisions of these regulations, shall relieve any person or entity
from responsibility for damage to any person or property that is otherwise
imposed by law.
(Ord. 2009-74. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1193.04 CONFLICTS, SEVERABILITY, NUISANCES, AND RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon land than is
imposed or required by other Community provisions of law, ordinance, contract
or deed, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.
   (b)   If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any clause, section, or
provision of these regulations invalid or unconstitutional, the validity of the
remainder shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)   These regulations shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a private or public nuisance on their property. Compliance with the
provisions of this regulation shall not be a defense in any action to abate
such nuisance.
   (d)   Failure of the Community to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the
owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting there from,
and shall not result in the Community, its officers, employees, or agents being
responsible for any condition or damage resulting there from. (Ord. 2009-74.
Passed 6-22-09.)
   1193.05 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This chapter and its regulations shall become effective upon their passage.

Inspections and maintenance will be incorporated periodically throughout the
year to ensure that the facilities are properly operational.
   (e)   Perpetual Maintenance Inspections: One (1) inspection with a written
report will be performed each year. The written report will be given to the
Engineering Director and/or his or her designees by May 1st of each and every
year after the Best Management Practice (BMP) has been completed.
      (1)   Structures that require a permit from the Ohio Division of Water:
A written and stamped report from a professional engineer on the status of all
structural BMPs that require a permit from the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources (ODNR) Division of Water. This applies to all BMPs that require a
permit either at the time of construction or fall under the jurisdiction of the
ODNR Division of Water at any time after construction is completed.
      (2)   Easements: A written report from an inspector on the status of all
storm water management easements for each project shall be submitted to the
Engineering Director and/or his or her designees by May 1st of each year into
perpetuity. These reports will document if restricted plantings, fences and
structures are on the easement and will identify the location of the noted
easement restriction violations.
      (3)   Best Management Practices (BMPs) that do not have a high risk for
loss of life, bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure related
to imminent failure as determined by the Engineering Director and/or his or her
designees.  A written and stamped report from a professional engineer,
landscape architect or Certified Professional In Erosion and Sediment Control
(CPESC) on the status of permanent soil erosion, sediment control, water
quality management systems and the status of the related easements shall be
submitted to the Engineering Director and/or his or her designees by May 1st of
each year into perpetuity.
      (4)   BMPs that have a potential loss of Life: A written and stamped
report covering the status of all BMPs that have a potential for loss of life,
bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure will be prepared by a
professional engineer or other individual possessing a valid state license that
authorizes them to design the same type of BMP for construction. (Ord. 2009-74.
Passed 6-22-09.)
   1193.13 MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the owner or
person responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and
practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the following
standards.
   (a)   The plan shall include measures that control the flow of runoff from
disturbed areas so as to prevent soil erosion from occurring.
   (b)   Structural Practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from areas remaining disturbed for more than 14 days.
   (c)   Sediment Barriers: Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
intercepted by Silt Fence or Diversions to protect adjacent properties and
water resources from sediment. Where intended to provide sediment control, Silt
Fence shall be placed on a level contour. The relationship between the maximum
drainage areas to Silt Fence for a particular slope is shown in the following
table.
Table 1: Silt Fence Applicability
 
Maximum drainage area (in acres) to 100 Range of slope for a particular
linear feet of Silt Fence               drainage area (in percent)
0.5                                     < 2%
0.25                                    > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                   > 20% but < 50%
 
   This does not preclude the use of other sediment barriers designed to
control sheet flow runoff. The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier
shall not exceed the design capacity for that sediment barrier. Straw Bale
Barriers are not acceptable.
   (d)   Storm Water Diversion Practices: Storm water diversion practices shall
be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Such practices, which include Swales, Dikes, Berms, Roadside
Ditches, Pipe Slope Drains and Diversions, may receive storm water runoff from
areas up to ten (10) acres. Storm water diversion practices alone are not
considered a sediment control practice unless those are used in conjunction
with a sediment-settling pond.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.
   (f)   Clearing and Grubbing will be done in two (2) or more phases. The
first phase will include only those locations necessary to install the
perimeter soil erosion, sediment and storm water control BMPs. After the
perimeter controls are in place and functioning, the remaining phase(s) of
clearing and grubbing may continue.
   (g)   Timing of Sediment Trapping Practices: Sediment control practices
shall be functional throughout all phases of up slope earth disturbing
activity. Settling facilities, perimeter controls and other practices intended
to trap sediment shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7)
days from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up
slope development area is permanently restabilized. As construction progresses
and the topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or
existing controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
   (h)   Stabilization of Denuded Areas: Disturbed areas must be stabilized as
specified in the tables below, or according to the Ohio EPA NPDES Storm Water
Permit Rules, whichever is most restrictive:
Table 2: Permanent Stabilization

   Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural instability
or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques must be
employed.
   (i)   Sediment Settling Ponds: Storm water runoff that exceeds the design
capacity of sediment barriers and concentrated storm water flows shall pass
through a sediment settling facility.
      (1)   Where storm sewer drainage areas include 10 or more acres disturbed
at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment settling pond must be provided
until final stabilization of the site. In single-family residential
construction, final stabilization is after the houses are built and permanent
landscaping is done.
         A.   Alternative equivalent controls may be used if the owner can
show, in writing, that the Ohio EPA approved the use the alternatives in the
(Ohio EPA NPDES Permit for Construction Activity) Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWP3) for the site.
         B.   It is recommended that for drainage locations of less than 10
acres, smaller sediment settling basins and/or Sediment Traps be used.
      (2)   Each facility's storage capacity shall be no less than sixty-seven
(67) cubic yards per acre of total contributing drainage area. The storage
volume will be measured from the bottom of the basin to the top of the primary
(principle) spillway.
      (3)   Permanent storm water management ponds that are designed to trap
sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of
sediment-laden water. The draw down time must be at least 72 hours, or meet the
criteria in the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual whichever is most
stringent.
      (4)   The design configuration between inlet(s) and the outlet of
settling ponds must provide at least two units of length for each one unit of
width (> 2:1 length to width ratio).
      (5)   The depth of the sediment settling pond must be less than or equal
to five (5) feet.
      (6)   Sediment must be removed from the sediment settling ponds when the
design capacity has been reduced by 40%.
      (7)   Public safety, especially as it relates to children, must be
considered in the design. Alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design.
      (8)   Temporary sediment settling ponds will not be constructed in any
stream channel, wetland or sensitive area.
   (j)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection:
      (1)   All storm sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter
the storm sewer, unless the storm drain system drains to a Sediment Settling
Pond and is exempted in writing by the Engineering Director and/or his or her
designees. In areas where construction will be ongoing, such as subdivisions,
the storm sewer protection shall be maintained until all up slope areas reach
final stabilization, as determined by the Engineering Director and/or his or
her designees.
      (2)   At the end of this period the site owner shall hydraulically clean
the storm sewers to the satisfaction of the Engineering Director and/or his or
her designees. All sediments shall be removed from the system and shall not be
flushed downstream.
   (k)   Storm Sewer & Other Drainage Outlets: The outlet of all storm sewers,
footer drains, roof gutter drains and all other drains will be located at the
bottom of the slope. The slope below the outlet will be able to control the
water being drained through the storm sewer or other drains without causing
erosion of the stream or channel banks or channel bottom or other from which
the water is discharged.
   (l)   Working Near, Or Crossing Streams and Wetlands:
      (1)   Construction vehicles shall avoid water resources, wetlands,
riparian areas, and their setbacks. If construction vehicles must cross these
areas during construction, an approved temporary crossing shall be constructed.
Streams, including intermittent streams with a defined bed and banks, shall be
restabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed, interrupted, or
stopped. Erodible materials will not be used in making stream crossings.
      (2)   No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or
placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may slough, slip,
or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is authorized by
the approving authority and, when applicable, the US Army Corps Of Engineers
and Ohio EPA, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges,
culverts, and erosion or sediment control structures.
      (3)   If construction activities disturb areas adjacent to streams,
structural practices shall be designed and implemented on site to protect the
adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment runoff.
      (4)   No temporary or permanent sediment controls will be constructed in
a stream channel.
      (5)   Streams and wetland setbacks required by the community will be
implemented. As a minimum a setback of 25 feet, as measured from the ordinary
high water mark of the surface water, will be maintained in its natural state
as a permanent buffer.
   (m)   Construction Entrance:
      (1)   Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto public
roads, or surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls.
      (2)   Stone with geotextile construction entrance(s) shall be implemented
as required by the Engineering Director and/or his or her designees and the
Ohio EPA. These will be planned and installed according to the requirements in
the most recent edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual.
      (3)   Where soil is transported onto a public road surface, the roads
shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or more frequently, in
order to ensure public safety. Soil shall be removed from paved surfaces by
shoveling or sweeping. Street washing shall be allowed only after shoveling or
sweeping has removed most of the sediment and street sewer inlet protection is
properly installed unless end of sewer sediment ponds exist and are properly
functioning.
      (4)   Erodible material ramps in streets will not be used to enable
equipment to cross curbs. Non-erosive materials (e.g. wood and stone) can be
used.
   (n)   Unstable Soils:
      (1)   Unstable soils will be as determined by the local county Soil
Survey or by a detailed soils report.
      (2)   The Engineering Director and/or his or her designees may require
detailed soil reports when deemed necessary.
      (3)   Unstable soils prone to slipping or land sliding shall not be
graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
performed in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's
recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems.
   (o)   Cut And Fill Slopes: Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage. Consideration
shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope
drainage area, groundwater conditions and slope stabilization. The minimum
final unreinforced soil slopes will have a horizontal to vertical ratio of 2:1
(the horizontal will be two (2) times the vertical).
   (p)   Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels: Outfalls and constructed or
modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow from the planned post-development frequency storm without
eroding. The planned post-construction velocity and flow shall include the
entire contributing watershed.
   (q)   Establishment of Permanent Vegetation: A permanent vegetative cover
shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized.
Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is
achieved which, in the opinion of the Engineering Director and/or his or her
designees, has 80% vegetative density over the entire disturbed area and
provides adequate cover, and is mature enough to satisfactorily control soil
erosion and survive adverse weather conditions.
   (r)   Disposition of Temporary Practices: All temporary soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be disposed of immediately after final site
stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer
needed, unless otherwise required by the Engineering Director and/or his or her
designees. Trapped sediment shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further
erosion. The Construction Maintenance Guarantee shall not be released by the
Community until all temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices that
are no longer needed have been removed, properly disposed of and any trapped
sediment has been stabilized.
   (s)   Underground Utility Construction: The construction of underground
utility lines, pipes, etc. shall be subject to the following criteria:
      (1)   Trenches shall remain open for no more than five days.
      (2)   There shall be no turbid discharges to surface waters resulting
from dewatering activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it
must pass through a sediment settling pond or another equally effective
sediment control device, prior to being discharged from the construction site
or to waters of the state.
      (3)   When discharging clean ground water care must be taken to ensure
that it does not become pollutant laden by crossing over disturbed soils or
other pollutant sources.
   (t)   Inspections:
      (1)   If inspections or other information indicates a control has been
used inappropriately or incorrectly or it has failed, it must be replaced or
modified for the site conditions.
      (2)   The owner of the development area shall have the site inspected for
soil erosion, sediment control and other environmental concerns every seven (7)
calendar days, and within twenty-four (24) hours of a 0.5 inch or greater
rainfall event until the Engineering Director and/or his or her designees
certifies the site as being stable. The Engineering Director and/or his or her
designee's certification does not relieve the permittee from meeting the Ohio
EPA NPDES inspection requirements.
      (3)   The owner, or his designated representative, shall keep a written
log of each inspection and any subsequent improvements to the soil erosion,
sediment control or other environmental controls. The inspections shall include
the date of the inspection, the name of the inspector, weather conditions, and
the actions needed to correct the identified problems.
      (4)   The inspection log will include the date and actions taken to
correct problems noted in past inspection logs.
      (5)   If the construction site is subject to Ohio EPA's National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for construction
activity, a copy of all of the required inspection sheets will be submitted to
the Engineering Director and/or his or her designees within three (3) working
days of the date that the inspection was conducted.
      (6)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (7)   Erosion and sediment controls identified in the Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan shall be observed to ensure that they are operating
correctly.
      (8)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving waters.
      (9)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (10)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of
repair or maintenance, with the exception of sediment settling ponds, it must
be repaired or maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment
settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the
inspection.
      (11)   If any inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform
its intended function and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the Construction Site Conservation Plan must be amended and the new
control practice must be installed within 10 days of the inspection.
      (12)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice has not been
implemented in the time required by this ordinance it must be installed within
ten (10) days from the date of inspection.
      (13)   If the inspection reveals that a planned control practice is not
needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the
control practice is not needed.
   (u)   Control of Materials and Debris: Site management practices shall be
implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris
from entering the Community's and state's water resources or wetlands. These
practices shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   A covered dumpster shall be made available for the proper disposal
of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum
and etc. A second covered dumpster will be provided for the proper disposal of
toxic and hazardous wastes.
      (2)   The washing of excess concrete material into a street, catch basin,
or other public facility or natural resource shall not occur. A designated area
for concrete washouts shall be made available and used for all concrete
washouts.
      (3)   All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a marked storage area.
A dike shall be constructed around this storage area with a minimum capacity
equal to 110% of the volume of the largest container in the storage area. All
additional requirements of the local fire authority must be followed. If the
fuel tanks have a self-contained "dike," the plug will be kept in the "dike"
tank at all times.
      (4)   Any toxic or hazardous wastes and/or contaminated soils must be
disposed of according to all applicable environmental laws and statutes. Local
health districts and Ohio EPA can provide guidance on these issues.
      (5)   On a site with a prior industrial land use or a site that is
contaminated with gasoline, fuel oil, hydrocarbon based chemicals or other Ohio
EPA regulated contaminates, the storm water is considered wastewater. A permit
from Ohio EPA is required to address these sites.
      (6)   Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid
waste landfill sites.
      (7)   Paint, paint washing liquids, excess paints and other paint wastes
are considered solid wastes and shall be disposed of in accordance with
applicable state regulations. Appropriate handling of these wastes shall occur
at the site so as to prevent the discharge of these wastes into surface or
ground waters.
         A.   Water based paint washing liquids and small quantities of excess
water based paints may be disposed of by flushing down a connected sanitary
sewer but may not be disposed of in an on-lot disposal system.
         B.   All other paints, paint thinners, and paint cleaning materials
will be disposed of in the site's hazardous waste disposal dumpster.
      (8)   Restroom facilities will be provided for site workers at all times
that workers are present on the site and during all phases of the construction.
      (9)   All required permits from appropriate federal, state, or local
agencies are required to develop land with a previous industrial or commercial
use or another use that may have led to soil contamination by a regulated
pollutant.
   (v)   Pre-winter Stabilization: If the development area will, or is planned
to remain, active through the winter months, the owner of the development area
shall hold a Pre-Winter Stabilization Meeting. The meeting will be held before
October 1st. The owner shall invite the operator, developer, engineer,
contractor, Engineering Director and/or his or her designees and anyone else
requested by the Engineering Director and/or his or her designees to the
meeting.
   (w)   Storm Water Basins:
      (1)   Pool Geometry: The minimum length-to-width ratio for the pond is 3:
1 (the length will be three (3) times the width).
      (2)   Riser in Embankment: The riser shall be located within the
embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will be by
manholes.
      (3)   Water Drains: Each retention basin shall have a drainpipe that can
completely drain the pond. The drain shall have an elbow within the pond to
prevent sediment deposition from plugging the drain.
      (4)   Adjustable Gate Valves:  Both the storm water management and water
quality basin drains shall have adjustable gate valves. Valves shall be located
inside the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be operated in a
safe and convenient manner. During the annual inspections the valves shall be
fully opened and closed at least once, and the certifying official shall attest
to this on the inspection form. To prevent vandalism, the handwheel shall be
chained to a ringbolt or manhole step.
      (5)   Principal Spillway: Each principal spillway shall be designed in
accordance with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving
the county. Each principal spillway shall have the capacity to pass the 100-
year design storm flow. The inlet or riser size for the pipe drops shall be
designed so that the flow through the structure goes from weir flow control to
pipe flow control without going into orifice control in the riser. The crest
elevation of the primary spillway shall be no less than one foot below the
emergency spillway crest. Premium joint pipe is required and a removable trash
rack shall be installed at each location. Anti-seep collars shall be provided
for all pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (6)   Emergency Spillway: An emergency spillway shall be provided on each
storm water management basin. Emergency spillways shall convey flood flows
safely past the embankment, and shall be designed in accordance with NRCS
standards and specifications for the office serving the local county. Emergency
spillways shall have a 100-year design storm capacity unless exempted in
writing by the Engineering Director and/or his or her designees.
      (7)   Embankments: Each dam embankment shall be designed in accordance
with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the county
that the project is located in. Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all
pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (8)   Safety Features:
         A.   The primary spillway opening shall not permit access to the
public and other non-maintenance personnel.
         B.   The perimeter of all water pool areas that are deeper than three
(3) feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:
            i.   A safety bench, with a maximum slope of 3%, which extends
outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a minimum of 25
feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and maintenance vehicles
that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench may be landscaped,
without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water pool.
            ii.   Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than 3:1 (3 feet horizontal for every 1 foot vertical).
            iii.   An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of 15 inches below the
normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped to prevent
access to the deeper water pool.
            iv.   Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (2 feet horizontal for every 1 foot
vertical).
            v.   The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards.
            vi.   Side slopes getting to the pond shall not exceed 3:1 and
shall terminate on a safety bench.
            vii.   Soil erosion and sediment control practices used to satisfy
these standards shall meet the standards and specifications in the current
edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, NRCS Field Office
Technical Guide for the local county or the Ohio EPA, which ever is most
stringent.
   (x)   These standards are general guidelines and shall not limit the right
of the Engineering Director and/or his or her designees to impose at any time
additional, more stringent requirements, nor shall the standards limit the
right of the Engineering Director and/or his or her designees to waive, in
writing, individual requirements.
   (y)   Soil limitations shall be determined by using the current edition of
the county soil survey written by the NRCS, USDA.
   (z)   Methods for controlling increases in storm water runoff peaks and
volumes may include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction; for example,
grassed road ditches rather than paved street gutters where practical,
discharging roof water to vegetated areas, or grass and rock-lined drainage
channels.
      (2)   Grading and use of grade control structures to provide a level of
control in flow paths and stream gradients.
      (3)   Induced infiltration of increased storm water runoff into soil,
where practical; for example, constructing special infiltration areas where
soils are suitable, retaining topsoil for all areas to be vegetated, or
providing good infiltration areas with proper emergency overflow facilities.
      (4)   Provisions for detention and retention, for example, permanent
retention ponds and lakes, dry detention basins, and subsurface detention
tanks.
         (Ord. 2009-74. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1193.14 STREAM CHANNEL AND FLOODPLAIN EROSION DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   Runoff Rate: The peak runoff rate from the development area shall not
be greater after development than it was before development. The applicant
shall provide calculations proving no increase in the runoff rates from the one
(1), two (2), five (5), ten (10), twenty-five (25), fifty (50) and one hundred
(100) year storms.
   (b)   Runoff Volume: Increases in the runoff volume shall be offset by
further restricting runoff rates. Based on the increase in runoff volume, the
applicant shall determine the critical storm for the development area. The
runoff rate from the critical storm shall be restricted to the one (1) year
pre-development storm runoff rate. The critical storm shall be calculated as
follows:
      (1)   Determine the total volume of runoff from a one-year frequency,
twenty-four hour storm, occurring on the development area before and after
development.
      (2)   From the volumes in paragraph (1) determine the percent of increase
in volume of runoff due to development according to the equation (Q after
divided by the Q before) X 100 and, using this percentage, select the critical
storm from this table:
Table 4: Critical Storm Selection
The Percentage Increase in Volume of Runoff Is:
Equal To Or  And Less Than The 24-Hour “Critical Storm” For Discharge Will Be
Greater Than
0            10            1 Year
10           20            2 Years
20           50            5 Years
50           100           10 Years
100          250           25 Years
250          500           50 Years
500          ---           100 Years
 
   (c)   Detention or Retention Basin Exemption for Redevelopment or for
Expansion of Existing Facilities
      (1)   For any development regulated by this ordinance, the construction
of a detention or retention basin may not be required for the development if
the post-development peak discharge for a 100 year frequency 24 hour storm
increases the existing peak discharge by one (1) cubic foot per second or less
using the TR-55 method of calculation or other method approved by the
Engineering Director and/or his or her designees. The Engineering Director and/
or his or her designees can waive this requirement if existing storm sewers and
drainage structures can safely handle the expected increase in flow.
      (2)   Only one (1) exemption will be allowed per parcel. Any subsequent
expansion must provide for detention or retention and must include the
previously exempted area.
   (d)   Where the Engineering Director and/or his or her designees determines
that site constraints exist in a manner that compromises the intent of this
ordinance to improve the management of storm water runoff as established in
this section, practical alternatives may be used to result in an improvement of
water quality and/or a reduction of storm water runoff. Such alternatives must
be in keeping with the intent and likely cost of those measures that would
otherwise be required to meet the objectives of this section. When possible,
all practical alternatives shall be implemented within the drainage area of the
proposed development project. Practical alternatives can include, but are not
limited to:
      (1)   Fees shall be paid in an amount specified by the Engineering
Director and/or his or her designees. These fees shall be applied by the
Community to storm water management practices that reduce existing storm water
runoff.
      (2)   Implementation of off-site storm water management practices.
      (3)   Watershed or stream restoration.
      (4)   Retrofitting of an existing storm water management practice.
      (5)   Other practices approved by the Engineering Director and/or his or
her designees in keeping with the intent of this section.

   1195.01  COMPREHENSIVE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   The Post-Construction Water Quality Plan developed to meet this regulation
will be coordinated and combined with the Riparian and Wetland Setback Plan and
the Construction Site Conservation Plan that are developed for the same site.
These plans will be titled and numbered in one consecutive sequence to make a
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan for the site. The Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plan so developed will serve as the Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part of the NPDES Storm Water
Permit for General Construction.
(Ord. 2009-75. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1195.02 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The intent of these regulations is to:
      (1)   Allow development while reducing damage to receiving water
resources and drainage systems that may be caused by new development or
redevelopment activities.
      (2)   Protect and maintain the receiving stream's physical, chemical,
biological characteristics and stream functions.
      (3)   Provide perpetual management of storm water runoff quality and
quantity.
      (4)   Establish consistent technically feasible and operationally
practical standards to achieve a level of storm water quantity and quality
control that will minimize damage to public and private property and
degradation of water resources, and will promote and maintain the health,
safety, and welfare of the residents of the Community.
      (5)   Control storm water runoff resulting from soil disturbing
activities.
      (6)   Preserve, to the maximum extent practicable (MEP), the natural
drainage characteristics of the building site.
      (7)   Preserve, to the maximum extent practicable (MEP), natural
infiltration and groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that
replenishes water resources, wetlands, and wells.
      (8)   Assure that storm water quality controls are incorporated into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage.
      (9)   Reduce the need for costly treatment and mitigation for the damage
to and loss of water resources that are the result of inadequate storm water
quality control.
      (10)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to
address problems caused by inadequate storm water quality control.
      (11)   Require the incorporation of water quality protection that
encourages and promotes habitat preservation into the construction of storm
water management practices.
      (12)   Ensure that all storm water quality practices are properly
designed, constructed, and maintained.
         (Ord. 2009-75. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1195.03 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   Neither submission of a plan under the provisions herein, nor compliance
with the provisions of these regulations, shall relieve any person or entity
from responsibility for damage to any person or property that is otherwise
imposed by law.
(Ord. 2009-75. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1195.04 CONFLICTS, SEVERABILITY, NUISANCES, AND RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon land than is
imposed or required by other Community provisions of law, ordinance, contract
or deed, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
   (b)   If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any clause, section, or
provision of these regulations invalid or unconstitutional, the validity of the
remainder shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)   These regulations shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a private or public nuisance on their property. Compliance with the
provisions of this regulation shall not be a defense in any action to abate
such nuisance.
   (d)   Failure of the Community to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the
owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting there from,
and shall not result in the Community, its officers, employees, or agents being
responsible for any condition or damage resulting there from. (Ord. 2009-75.
Passed 6-22-09.)

practices that is determined to be the most effective, practicable (including
technological, economic, and institutional considerations) means of preventing
or reducing the amount of pollution generated by nonpoint sources of pollution
to a level compatible with water quality goals. BMPs may include structural
practices, conservation practices and operation and maintenance procedures.
   (b)   BOG: A rare type of wetland containing acid tolerant mosses, plants,
insects and animals. Bogs filter and use acidic ground, surface and rain water
and prevent flooding by absorption. This very sensitive habitat is of high

land uses and construction of new ones.
   (gg)   RETENTION BASIN: A storm water management pond that maintains a
permanent pool of water. These storm water management ponds include a properly
engineered/designed volume dedicated to the temporary storage and slow release
of runoff waters.
   (hh)   RIPARIAN AREA: Naturally vegetated land adjacent to watercourses
which, if appropriately sized, helps to, limit erosion, reduce flood flows,
and/or filter and settle out runoff pollutants, or which performs other
functions consistent with the purposes of these regulations.
   (ii)   RIPARIAN SETBACK: Those lands within the Community which are
alongside streams, and which fall within the area that the Community prohibits
and restricts changes in land use and the building of structures.

disturbs five (5) or more acres of land or will disturb less than five (5)
acres, but is a part of a larger common plan of development or sale, which will
disturb five (5) or more acres of land shall identify:
         A.   Storm Water Detention: The Post-Construction BMP(s) chosen must
be able to detain storm water runoff for protection of the stream channels,
stream erosion control, and improved water quality, and pollution prevention.
         B.   Structural BMPs: Structural (designed) Post-Construction storm
water treatment practices shall be incorporated into the permanent drainage
system for the site.
         C.   Properly Sized BMPs: The BMP(s) chosen must be sized to treat the

Standards in OAC Chapter 3745-1. The WQv shall be equivalent to the volume of
runoff from a 0.75-inch rainfall and shall be determined according to one of
the two following methods:
            i.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the local
municipal permitting authority that uses continuous hydrologic simulation and
local long-term hourly precipitation records or
            ii.   Using the following equation: WQv = C * P * A / 12 where: WQv
= water quality volume in acre-feet C = runoff coefficient appropriate for
storms less than 1 inch (see Table 1) P = 0.75 inch precipitation depth A =
area draining into the BMP in acres
 
Table 1 Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
 
         D.   Where the land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should
be calculated using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing
drainage area to the storm water treatment structure is Low Density
Residential, 30% is High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff
coefficient is calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3) + (0.3)(0.5) + (0.1)(0.2) =
0.35.
         E.   An additional volume equal to 20 percent of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the BMP for sediment storage and/or reduced infiltration
capacity. The BMPs will be designed according to the methodology included in
the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, ODOT Post-Construction storm
water standards, or other manual that is acceptable to Ohio EPA.
         F.   BMPs shall be designed such that the drain time is long enough to
provide treatment, but short enough to provide storage available for successive
rainfall events as described in Table 2 below
Table 2: Target Draw Down (Drain) Times for Structural Post-Construction
Treatment Control Practices
 
Best Management Practice                    Drain Time of WQv
Infiltration                                24-48 hours
Vegetated Swale and Filter Strip            24 hours
Extended Detention Basin (Dry Basins)       48 hours
Retention Basins (Wet Basins)*              24 hours
Constructed Wetlands (above permanent pool) 24 hours
Media Filtration, Bioretention              40 hours
 
Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized at 0.75 * WQ
         G.   The owner may request approval from the Engineering Director and/
or his or her designees to use alternative structural Post-Construction BMPs if
the owner can demonstrate, in a way that is acceptable to Ohio EPA rules and
regulations, that the alternative BMPs are equivalent in effectiveness to those
listed in Table 2 above. The use of alternative or vender supplied Post-
Construction BMPs should be limited to redevelopment projects where
justification is provided that the traditional BMPs in Table 2 are technically
and economically infeasible.
         H.   Construction activities shall be exempt from this condition if it
can be demonstrated that the WQv is provided within an existing structural
Post-Construction BMP that is part of a larger common plan of development or
sale or if structural Post-Construction BMPs are addressed in a regional or
local storm water management plan.
         I.   For redevelopment projects (i.e., developments on previously
developed property), Post-Construction practices shall either ensure a 20
percent net reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at
least 20 percent of the WQv, or a combination of the two.
         J.   Site Description:
            i.   The prior land uses of the site

expected to be disturbed (i.e., grubbing, clearing, excavating, filling or
grading, including off-site borrow, fill or spoil areas and off-site utility
installation areas)
            iv.   Amount of the impervious area and percent imperviousness
created by the construction activity
            v.   Name and/or location of the immediate receiving stream or
surface water(s) and the first subsequent named receiving water and the major

               II.   Conservation Easements
               III.   Other sensitive natural resources and areas receiving
runoff from the development.
         L.   The existing and proposed topography shown in the appropriate
contour intervals as determined by the Engineering Director and/or his or her
designees (generally one-foot contours are used).

prevent sediment deposition from plugging the drain, and prevent sediment
deposition from draining into the nearby waterways.
      (4)   Adjustable Gate Valves: Both the Water Quality and the Storm Water
Management Basin drains shall have adjustable gate valves. Valves shall be
located inside of the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be
operated in a safe and convenient manner. During the annual inspections the
valves shall be fully opened and closed at least once, and the certifying
official shall attest to this on the inspection form. To prevent vandalism, the
handwheel shall be chained to a ringbolt or manhole step.
      (5)   Principal Spillway: Each principal spillway shall be designed in
accordance with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) standards and
specifications for the office serving the local county. Each principal spillway
shall have the capacity to pass the 100-year design storm flows. The inlet or
riser size for the pipe drops shall be designed so that the flow through the
structure goes from weir flow control to pipe flow control without going into
orifice control in the riser. The crest elevation of the primary spillway shall
be no less than one foot below the emergency spillway crest. Premium joint pipe
is required and a removable trash rack shall be installed at each location.
Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all pipe conduits through an
embankment.
      (6)   Emergency Spillway: An emergency spillway shall be provided on each
Water Quality and Storm Water Management basin. Emergency spillways shall
convey flood flows safely past the embankment, and shall be designed in
accordance with NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the
local county. Emergency spillways shall have a 100-year design storm capacity
unless exempted in writing by Engineering Director and/or his or her designees.
      (7)   Embankments: Each dam embankment shall be designed in accordance
with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the county
that the project is located in. Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all
pipe conduits through an embankment.

(3) feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:
            i.   A safety bench, with a maximum slope of 3%, which extends
outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a minimum of 25
feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and maintenance vehicles
that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench may be landscaped,
without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water pool.
            ii.   Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than 3:1 (3 feet horizontal for every 1 foot vertical).
            iii.   An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of 15 inches below the
normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped to prevent
access to the deeper water pool. The aquatic bench may also be incorporated
into the Post-Construction Water Quality Plan.
            iv.   Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (2 feet horizontal for every 1 foot
vertical).
            v.   The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards. Side slopes getting to the pond shall
not exceed 3:1 and shall terminate on a safety bench.
      (9)   Water Quality Basin: If a Water Quality Basin is needed and can not
be incorporated into an existing or planned Detention or Retention Basin then a
separate Water Quality Basin will need to be planned, designed, constructed and
maintained into perpetuity.
         A.   Water Quality Basins will not be constructed in any permanent or
intermittent stream channel.
      (10)   Flexibility: These standards are general guidelines and shall not
limit the right of the Engineering Director and/or his or her designees to
impose at any time additional and/or more stringent requirements nor shall the
standards limit the right of the Engineering Director and/or his or her
designees to waive, in writing, individual requirements.
         A.   If the Engineering Director and/or his or her designees waives,
in writing, individual requirements the owner will provide the Engineering
Director and/or his or her designees with the information and documentation
required to assure Ohio EPA that the waived requirement will not degrade water
quality.
            (Ord. 2009-75. Passed 6-22-09.)
   1195.13 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   Where the Engineering Director and/or his or her designees determines that
site constraints exist in a manner that compromises the intent of this
ordinance to improve the management of storm water runoff as established in
this ordinance, practical alternatives may be used to result in an improvement
of water quality and/or a reduction of storm water runoff. Such alternatives
must be in keeping with the intent and likely cost of those measures that would
otherwise be required to meet the objectives of this section. When possible,
all practical alternatives shall be implemented within the drainage area of the
proposed development project. Practical alternatives can include, but are not
limited to:
   (a)   Fees in an amount equivalent to the cost of design, installation and
maintenance of accepted post construction storm water BMP's shall be paid. Such
costs shall be verified and documented by the Engineering Director and/or his
or her designee's. Such fees shall be placed in an account and applied to storm
water management practices to improve storm water quality in the community.
   (b)   Implementation of off-site storm water management practices.
   (c)   Watershed or stream restoration within the community.

discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or Waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the City of Streetsboro may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 of the United States, or to
minimize danger to persons.
   (b)   Suspension due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge.
      (1)   Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of these rules may
have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an
illicit discharge. The City of Streetsboro will notify a violator of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access.
      (2)   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this Section, without the prior approval of the
City of Streetsboro.
         (Ord. 2010-31. Passed 4-26-10.)
   1197.08 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.

achieve the purpose of these rules. The City of Streetsboro, if it is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of these
rules or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program to verify compliance with these rules or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of citizens; may seek, as part of the inspection warrant:
         A.   Access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept
under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the
performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.

   1197.10 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS
BY THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The City of Streetsboro will adopt requirements identifying Best Management
Practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain
system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or
industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity,
to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of
this section. These BMPs shall be part of a storm water pollution prevention
plan (SWP3) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 2010-31. Passed 4-26-10.)
   1197.11  WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.

person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 2010-31. Passed 4-26-10.)
   1197.12 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the State,
said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the City of
Streetsboro in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business
day. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three
years.

   1329.01 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   The following standards shall apply in all areas of special flood hazard in
the City as designated on the official maps prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in conjunction with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.
The maps are on permanent file in the Building Department and Service
Departments.
(Ord. 1999-02. Passed 1-11-99.)
   1329.02  DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply. In
the event of conflict between any provision of this chapter and another
provision of any other chapter of this Building Code, or any other provision of
the Codified Ordinances, or Federal and State laws adopted by reference
therein, the specific shall control over the general and the more restrictive
shall govern over the less restrictive.
   (a)   "Accessory structure" means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   "Area of special flood hazard" means the land in the flood plain
within a community subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding
in any given year.
   (c)   "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   (d)   "Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating or drilling operations located
within the area of special flood hazard.
   (e)   "Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)" means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (f)   "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (g)   "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated the areas of special flood
hazard.
   (h)   "Flood Insurance Study" means the official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency has provided flood profiles and the water surface
elevations of the base flood.
   (i)   "Flood way" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1)
foot.
   (j)   "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor.
   (k)   "New construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of this section.
   (l)   "Start of construction" means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on
the site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles,
the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
   (m)   "Structure" , for purposes of this chapter, means a walled and roofed
building, or gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (n)   "Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure either:
      (1)   Before the improvement or repair is started; or
      (2)   If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred.
      For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or
other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however,
include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places, or which is designated
a City of Streetsboro Landmark.

      (5)   Service facilities, such as electrical and heating equipment, shall
be elevated or flood proofed.
         (Ord. 1999-02. Passed 1-11-99.)
   
   1329.10 ENCROACHMENTS.
   (a)   Areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not
been provided by FEMA are designated as A Zones on the community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map. In accordance with Section
1329.17, the Building Director must utilize any available flood data, including
data pertaining to the delineation of a flood way, to regulate development
within A Zones. The flood way is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion
potential. The following provisions apply within all delineated flood way
areas:
      (1)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development, unless a technical evaluation
demonstrates that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   If subsection (a)(1) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this chapter.
    (b) Areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have been
provided by FEMA, as set forth in Section
1329.17, are designated as AE Zones (or numbered A Zones) on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map. Within these areas the following provisions apply:
      (1)   New construction, substantial improvements, or other development
(including fill) shall only be permitted if it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
      (2)   If subsection (b)(1) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this chapter.
         (Ord. 1999-02. Passed 1-11-99.)
   1329.11 APPEALS.
   Any determination made by the Director of Building pursuant to this chapter
may be appealed to the Board of Building Code Appeals as provided in Chapter
1309 of this Building Code.
(Ord. 1999-02. Passed 1-11-99.)
   1329.12 VARIANCES.
   (a)   Variances from the provisions of this chapter shall be determined by
the Board of Zoning Appeals as provided in Chapter
1309 of this Building Code, subject, however, to the additional criteria set
forth below.
   (b)   In considering all applications for variances from the terms of this
chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider the following flood hazard
factors in addition to other relevant provisions of this Building Code and the
Codified Ordinances:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept by flooding onto other lands
to the injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed use and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (5)   The necessity to the use of a water front location, where
applicable.
      (6)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
flood plain management program for that area.
      (7)   The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
      (8)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site.
      (9)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
   (c)   Upon consideration of the above factors, the Board of Zoning Appeals
may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems reasonably
necessary to further the purposes of this chapter and serve the public health,
safety and welfare.
(Ord. 1999-02. Passed 1-11-99.)
   
   1329.13  CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (a)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing the criteria in Section
1329.12(b) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the
one-half (½) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
   (b)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places,
the State Inventory of Historic Places, or one which has been designated a
Streetsboro Landmark or is located in a Landmark District, without regard to
the remaining procedures set forth in this section.
   (c)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated flood way if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (d)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (e)   Variances shall only be issued upon a finding of the following:
      (1)   Good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, public
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
Federal or State laws or the Codified Ordinances.
   (f)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice by the Building Director that the structure may be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
(Ord. 1999-02. Passed 1-11-99.)
   1329.14  INFORMATION TO BE OBTAINED AND MAINTAINED.
   The Building Director shall obtain and maintain on file open for public
inspection in the Building Department the following information relative to
construction or substantial improvement in areas of special flood hazard, where
base flood elevation data are utilized, in addition to any other information
required to be kept by the provisions of this Building Code, the Codified
Ordinances or State and Federal law.
   (a)   The actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest
floor, including basement, of all new or substantially improved structures, and
whether or not such structures contain a basement.
   (b)   For all new or substantially improved flood proofed structures:
      (1)   Verification and recording of the actual elevation (in relation to
mean sea level) to which the structure was flood proofed.
      (2)   Recording and maintenance of the flood proofing certifications
required by this chapter.
         (Ord. 1999-02. Passed 1-11-99.)
   1329.15 ALTERATION OF WATERCOURSES.
   (a)   The Building Director shall notify adjacent communities and the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, prior to any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (b)   The Building Director shall require that maintenance is provided
within the altered or relocated portion of such watercourse so that the flood
carrying capacity is not diminished.
(Ord. 1999-02. Passed 1-11-99.)
      
   1329.16 INTERPRETATION OF FLOOD BOUNDARIES.
   The Building Director shall make interpretations, where needed, as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for
example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions). Where a map boundary and elevations disagree, the
elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile shall prevail. The person
contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section
1329.11.
(Ord. 1999-02. Passed 1-11-99.)
   1329.17 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (a)   The areas of special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled
"Flood Insurance Study for the City of Streetsboro". This study, with
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps dated and effective June 15, 1981, as
amended, effective December 2, 1988, and any revisions thereto, are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The Flood
Insurance Study is on file for public inspection in the office of the Building
Director.
   (b)   Areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not
been provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in accordance with the
above paragraph are designated as Zone A on the community's Flood Insurance
Rate Map. Within these areas, the Building Director shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and flood way data available from a
Federal, State or other source in order to administer the provisions of this
chapter.
(Ord. 1999-02. Passed 1-11-99.)
   1329.18  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Streetsboro, any officer
or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 1999-02. Passed 1-11-99.)
   1329.96 APPEAL TO BOARD OF ZONING AND BUILDING APPEALS.
   Appeals may be made to the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals pursuant to
Sections
1309.01 and
 1309.07 of these Codified Ordinances. The appeals procedure shall be the
procedure provided under Sections
1105.11 and
1105.14 through

   (c)   Specific Requirements.
      (1)   All concrete used shall be subject to a strength test, if ordered
by the City Engineer. Such test to be made by a reputable laboratory selected
by the Engineer. If such test is required, six test cylinders, six (6") inches
in diameter and twelve (12") inches high shall be made as described in
“Standard Method of Making and Storing Compression Test Specimens of Concrete
in the Field”, A.S.T.M. Designation C31-33 for testing in accordance with
“Standard Methods of Making Compression Tests of Concrete”, A.S.T.M.
Designations C 39-33: three (3) sub cylinders shall be used to adequately
perform the required seven (7) day test, , and three (3) cylinders to
adequately perform the twenty-eight (28) day test. The resulting compression
strength must not be less than 2,500 pounds per square inch in seven (7) days
and not less than 3,500 pounds per square inch in twenty-eight (28) days.
Strength tests may be utilized for the purpose of checking on quality of
materials used and method of mixing. If any tests fall below the standard of
specifications set forth herein, the Engineer, may at his discretion, order the
contractor to discontinue the use of any cement, sand or stone being used in
the concrete, and to supply other grades of materials which will produce the
standard strength as specified above. The costs of all such tests shall be at
the expense of the contractor.
      (2)   Excavation of sub-grade shall be made to the depth necessary to
permit the required thickness of base and thickness of concrete for the
specified installation. The contractor shall remove all spongy material, roots,
shale, loam and earth, and all material excavated shall be removed from the
premises by the contractor. Any fill necessary to level shall meet the
specifications of this chapter and shall be compacted uniformly as may be
approved by the Building Director or his inspector.
      (3)   No broken concrete may be used as part of the bed unless the
excavation is carried deep enough to permit the use of such broken material
below the required thickness of finished concrete, as required by this chapter.
Base under concrete sidewalk, shall have a thickness or depth after compaction
of three (3") inches, under residential driveways of four (4") inches, and
under commercial driveways and that portion of the public sidewalk crossed by
such driveways of six (6") inches.
      (4)   Concrete shall be thoroughly mixed before being deposited in clean,
steel forms adequately braced to prevent distortion from the specified
dimensions. Steel forms shall be used on all straight sections of sidewalk. All
forms used, whether steel or wood, shall not be permitted to become warped or
twisted, shall be subject to approval of the Engineer or his inspector, and
shall be of a size sufficient to produce an installation of the required
thickness. All form shall be kept clean and free from defects and shall be
coated with a suitable oil before filling with concrete.
      (5)   Foundation beds shall be sprinkled immediately prior to the pouring
of the concrete, which when mixed shall be rapidly deposited in the forms, any
concrete not in final position within thirty (30) minutes after completion of
the mixing must be discarded. Under no circumstances may concrete that ha
partially set be used, and the re-mixing of such materials is specifically
prohibited. Concrete shall be deposited between bulkheads to a uniform
thickness and to the full depth and width of the form; any irregular or sloping
surfaces shall be avoided. Concrete after being placed or poured shall be
thoroughly tamped and consolidated so that none of the limestone appears on the
surface, and it shall be thoroughly compacted and brought to the proper pitch
and grade with a templet or straight edge.
      (6)    Immediately prior to finishing the surface, the concrete shall be
cut into slabs not longer than ten (10') feet on any one side. Control joints,
whether hand tooled or sawn, shall be to a depth of one-fourth the thickness of
the slab. Approved expansion joints shall be used on each side of the driveway
where it passes through the public sidewalk.
      (7)    Finishing of the work shall immediately follow the placing and
compacting of the concrete after the water sheen has disappeared from the
surface. All surfaces shall be free from depressions or inequalities. The
application of dry cement to hasten drying of the surface is specifically
prohibited.
      (8)    In rainy weather, concrete shall be protected as soon as it is
finished, and in hot or dry weather, the concrete shall be properly cured with
an approved curing compound, as per manufacturer’s specifications. No concrete
shall be poured between November 15th and April 30th without applying a six(6")
inch straw cover or an approved blanket cover.
      (9)    Prepared strips of bitumen and fiber or mineral aggregate, or
otherwise approved material a minimum one-half (½") thick shall be placed in
concrete installations at intervals of at least forty (40') feet, and shall
also be placed at all points where the work abuts curbing or a lateral
sidewalk, and along the line of a building where the work is laid full width
from the curb to a building or other structures. Similar joints shall be placed
around all water meter covers, gas boxes, hydrants, lamp tankards or other
fixed objects projecting through the installation. All such strips shall be a
minimum one-half (½") of an inch thickness.
      (10)    While the above specifications are based on the use of “ready
mix” concrete, it will be permissible to mix the concrete at the site of
installation, provided an inspector is present and further provided the
concrete is mixed in a mechanical batch type mixer operated for two (2) minutes
at a rate of twelve (12) to eighteen (18) revolutions per minute. Mixing by
hand in a box or on a platform is prohibited. Not more than five (5) gallons of
water shall be used per sack cement and all quantities of sand and aggregate
shall be measured before placing in the mixer. Proportions shall be governed by
the specifications set forth in this chapter.
      (11)    Concrete installations regulated by the requirements of this
chapter shall have the following this thickness or depth when used for the
following purposes:
         A.   Public sidewalks, except that portion crossed by a driveway,
shall have a thickness of four (4") inches, with a aggregate base of three (3")
inches.
         B.   That portion of private residential driveways within the limits
of any public highway (commonly called driveway aprons), and including that
portion of the public sidewalk crossed by such driveways, and a private
driveway not within the limits of a public highway shall have a thickness of
six (6") inches with a aggregate base of four (4") inches.
         C.   Private commercial driveways within the limits of any public
highway and including that portion of the public sidewalk crossed by such
driveways, shall have a thickness of a minimum eight (8") inches or more, as
may be required by the City Engineer. Aggregate base shall be thoroughly
tamped. The foregoing specifications are the minimum requirements, and any
installation which fails to meet such specifications will be considered as
faulty and will be condemned and required to be replaced. Determination of such
measurements shall be made after the aggregate base has been thoroughly
compressed or compacted in place.   
      (12)    The contractor shall use all due precautions to protect, and
shall follow stakes and working lines set by a surveyor and approved by the
City Engineer or his designee. All work shall be carried on and material placed
so as to offer the least possible obstruction to vehicular or pedestrian
traffic. Barricades and red lights shall be maintained by the contractor for
such period as may be required.
      (13)    No water may be used from City mains by a private contractor
unless permission shall be granted and provision made for the method of
measurement and payment for water used.
      (14)    Upon completion of any work, the area adjacent thereto shall be
cleared of all waste material, excavated dirt, etc., which the contractor shall
remove to the nearest dump.

1343.97    Noncompliance with notice.
1343.98    Penalty.
1343.99    Interpretation of chapter.
   1343.01 SPECIFICATIONS FOR ASPHALTIC INSTALLATIONS.
   (a)    The base for all asphaltic installations shall be five inches in
finished depth, and such base shall be of limestone ranging from two (2")
inches to one-half (½) inch screen, and all loads delivered shall be of uniform
mix without segregation of sizes. This material shall be evenly spread over the
rolled sub-grade and thoroughly consolidated with a power roller of at least
five (5) tons weight. Voids shall be filled with fine screenings after the
initial rolling and the surface sprayed with water during the final roller
operation. The finished top base shall be uniform in surface and shall show no
loose aggregates.
   (b)    An alternate base may be made by using Portland cement concrete four
(4") inches in depth. Such concrete shall be composed of one (1) part cement,
two and one-half (2½) parts sand and four (4) parts limestone. Only enough
water shall be hand-tamped in place on the rolled sub-grade. A covering of
burlap or heavy paper shall be left on for a period of at least six (6) days
before applying the two (2") inch asphalt surface.
   (c)    When the base has thoroughly dried to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer, the two (2") inch asphalt wearing surface may be laid. On the
foundation, as heretofore required, there shall be laid the bituminous concrete
wearing surface, which shall consist of a mineral aggregate mixed with
bituminous cement and laid as hereinafter specified. This wearing surface shall
have a thickness of two (2") inches after thorough compression with a roller
weighing at least five (5) tons.
   (d)    The mineral aggregate shall consist of a mixture of broken stone and
sand to which in some cases may be added a small quantity of stone dust or
Portland cement. Any sound, durable stone such as trap rock, blue limestone, or
granite, usually considered suitable for macadam surface, may be used. The
stone must be broken as nearly cubical as practicable and shall not show
distinct planes or cleavage or crystalline faces and shall not crush or split
under the roller when being consolidated in the installation. For the wearing
surface the stone shall vary in size from that passing a one and one-fourth
inch screen to that held on a one-fourth (¼") inch screen. The dust or fine
screenings shall be removed from the stone if excessive and irregular in
quality. The sand shall be similar in character to that commonly used in sheet
asphalt mixtures. It shall be hard-grained and moderately sharp, free from loam
or other foreign material and vary in size from that passing a one-fourth (¼")
inch screen to dust passing a 200 mesh screen. There shall not be over five
percent (5%) passing the 200 mesh and not over thirty percent (30%) on the ten
(10) mesh screen. The dust which may be added to the mixture shall be either
Portland cement or finely ground limestone. Not over four percent (4%) by
weight shall be added to any bituminous concrete mixture and a screening of the
combined aggregate should not be over six percent (6%) of 200 mesh material.
   
   (e)    The proportions of the various ingredients composing the bituminous
concrete shall be approximately three (3) parts of stone to two (2) parts of
sand, to which shall then be added bituminous cement sufficient so that from
seven (7%) to ten percent (10%) by weight of the mixture shall be bitumen
soluble in carbon disulphide.
   (f)    The mineral aggregate shall, before mixing with the bituminous
cement, be dried and heated in driers of approved type in which the material
does not come into contact with fire or flames. The driers shall be of the
revolving type, agitating and turning the material during the process of
drying. When the aggregate is thoroughly dried and heated to a temperature from
250 degrees to 355 degrees Fahrenheit, depending upon the climatic conditions
and the bituminous cement used, it shall be immediately, before being cooled or
exposed to moisture, mixed in a box known as the “pug type” with the hot
bituminous cement, as hereinafter specified. If stone dust is used, such
material shall be introduced directly into the mixer without passing through
the drier.
   (g)    The asphaltic cements used as the binding material shall be prepared
from refined oils having asphaltic base. The material shall be prepared with
asphaltic petroleum oils, to produce the required consistency. The asphalt
shall be homogeneous, free from water, and shall not foam when heated to 175
degrees Centigrade. Such asphalt shall meet the following requirements:
(1) Specific gravity 25°C, not less than             1.01
(2) Flash point, not less than                        175°C
(3) Softening point                                   40° - 55°C.
(4) Penetration 25°C, 100 gr. 5 sec                  80 - 90
(5) Loss at 163°C 5 hours                            1° maximum
(6) Penetration residue, 25°C, 100 gr 5 sec. At least55
(7) Total bitumen, at least                           99.5
(8) Organic, insoluble                                .02 maximum
   The contractor must certify in writing to the City Engineer of his
inspector, the character of the asphalt and the source of supply which he
contemplates using, prior to beginning the work.
   (h)    The mixture shall be spread by shoveling into place on the foundation
and leveling with heated metal rakes so that when compressed by self-propelled
roller weighing at least five (5) tons, it shall be two (2") inches in
thickness with surface even and true to grade. Along the curb and around
manholes, meter boxes and other obstructions where the roller cannot reach, the
compression shall be obtained by hot iron tampers. As soon as temperature will
permit, the mixture shall be rolled and the rolling continued lengthwise and
diagonally until all roller marks have disappeared and the surface give
indication of no further compressibility. When a joint is necessary, the
material shall be trimmed to a rough feather edge, painted with asphaltic
cement, and the hot material then raked over the joint and thoroughly tamped
and rolled. The process of laying must be continuous throughout each day’s
operation to avoid unnecessary joints or lack of cohesion between the different
batches delivered and installed.
   (i)    As soon as possible after the rolling of the mixture is finished and
while the surface is still warm and clean a coat of pure asphalt cement, heated
to a temperature of from 280 degrees to 320 degrees Fahrenheit shall be spread
over the surface and evenly distributed with rubber squeegees or roofing mops.
Only sufficient material shall be used to flush the surface voids without
leaving an excess. Immediately over this cement application of a top dressing
of torpedo sand or fine gravel, free from dust, which must be thoroughly dried
and heated shall be spread and rolled into the surface. A small excess of
gravel may be left to be worn in or away by traffic.

be construed to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
   Where the conditions imposed by a provision of this chapter are either more
or less restrictive than comparable provisions imposed by any other law,
ordinance, statute, or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more
restrictive or which impose higher standards or requirements shall prevail.
   Should any court of competent jurisdiction declare any section or subpart of
this chapter to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the

site location, property owner if known, and conditions found. Where the
Director of Public Safety determines that an immediate threat of human exposure
or injury exists, the City may conduct emergency dismantling and disposal of
drug processing apparatus and/or chemicals, To the extent permitted by law, the
individual or entity responsible, and/or the owner of the property where the
site is found, shall be liable to the City for its costs incurred in conducting
the emergency dismantling and disposal. Such costs may be recovered pursuant to
