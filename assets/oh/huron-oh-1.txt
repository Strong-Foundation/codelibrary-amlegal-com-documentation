ADOPTING ORDINANCE NO. 1980-15
AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES; TO REPEAL
ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH; TO PUBLISH THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER, AND
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   
   WHEREAS, the City has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.
Drane Company to prepare and publish a recodification of the City’s Ordinances,
and
   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council,
   NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the City of Huron, Ohio:
   Section 1. That the ordinances of the City of Huron, Ohio, of a general and
permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Huron, Ohio, 1980.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the City of Huron.
   Section 2. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect from and
immediately after passage of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or
parts thereof enacted prior to March 23, 1980, which are inconsistent with any
provision of the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective
date of this Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and modification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege;
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property;
      (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment;
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation;
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness;
      (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges;
      (7)   The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street or
public way;
      (8)   The dedication of property or plat approval;
      (9)   The annexation or detachment of territory;
      (10)   Any legislation enacted subsequent to March 23, 1980.
   Section 3. That this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety
of the residents of the City of Huron, Ohio, and for the further reason that
there exists an imperative necessity for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the
City, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation and avoid practical
and legal entanglements; wherefore, this Ordinance shall be in full force and
effect from and immediately following its adoption.

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR’S NOTE: Source material for the Codified Ordinances of Huron was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Huron Codified Ordinances is indicated.

the following Charter:

Huron". The corporation will hereinafter be referred to as "The City".
SECTION 1.02. POWERS.
   The city shall have and may exercise all municipal powers, functions,
rights, privileges, and immunities of every name and nature whatsoever, except
as prohibited by the Constitution of the United States, or the Constitution of
the state of Ohio, or as limited or restrained by this charter or by the
general statutes of the state of Ohio relating to matters of statewide concern.
The enumeration of specific powers in this charter shall not be deemed
exclusive, as it is intended that in addition to the powers enumerated herein
or implied therefrom or appropriate to the exercise of such enumerated powers,
the city shall have and may exercise all other and additional powers which it
would be competent for this charter specifically to enumerate.
SECTION 1.03. MANNER OF EXERCISE OF POWERS.

council. All powers shall be exercised in the manner prescribed in this
charter, or if the manner be not so prescribed, then in the manner prescribed
by ordinance. If no procedure is established either by the charter or by

SECTION 3.03. PROCEDURES FOR LEGISLATION.
   (A)   The following procedures shall apply to the passage of ordinances and

   Any ordinances which must be passed and made effective at once in order to
meet an emergency in the operation of the city government, or which are

separate section thereof, adopted by an affirmative vote of not less than five
members of the council, declare that such an emergency exists giving its
reasons therefor. No ordinance granting a franchise or fixing a rate to be
charged by a public utility corporation shall be passed as an emergency

and to be specially assessed for the cost thereof, and those making
appropriations for current operating expenses of the city government, shall
take effect upon passage and shall not be subject to referendum. All other
ordinances shall take effect thirty days after passage in order to afford an
opportunity for the filing of referendum petitions. (Amended 11-7-89)
SECTION 3.07. INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM.
   Except as otherwise provided in this charter, ordinances may be proposed and
submitted to popular vote by initiative and referendum under the procedure set
forth in Sections 731.28 to 731.40 of the Ohio Revised Code. Whenever the
council is required to pass more than one ordinance or resolution to complete
the legislation necessary to complete and pay for any public improvement, the
referendum shall apply only to the first ordinance or resolution to be passed
and not to any subsequent ordinance or resolution in the series relating
thereto. (Amended 11-7-89)

the code without reproducing it at length in the ordinance. However, if the
council desires to modify, add to or eliminate from any such code any section
or part thereof, such addition, modification or omission shall be clearly
stated in the ordinance. In all cases in which such a code shall be adopted by
reference, publication of the code, at length, by the city, shall not be
required. However, at least six copies of all such codes shall be kept in the
office of the clerk of council and the office of the city manager for
consultation by interested persons during regular office hours, and additional

by the office of the city manager. (Amended 11-7-89)
SECTION 3.09. RESOLUTIONS.
   Action by council which is not required by this charter to be taken by
ordinance, or which is not of general public application or interest, may be
taken by resolution. Such a resolution shall be introduced in writing by a
member of the council, and may be adopted by a viva voce vote of a majority of
a quorum. No waiting period, notice, hearing or publication shall be required
and a resolution shall become effective upon its adoption. However, the clerk
of council shall record resolutions in a separate book, which shall be a public
record. (Amended 11-7-89)
ARTICLE IV
CITY MANAGER
SECTION 4.01. APPOINTMENT OF CITY MANAGER.
   The council shall appoint, by resolution adopted by a five-sevenths majority
vote of all members elected thereto, an officer of the city who shall have the
title of city manager.
   The city manager shall be chosen by the council solely on the basis of his
executive and administrative qualifications in the profession of city
management, as judged by the adequacy of his technical training and his
successful experience in public administration. At the time of his appointment
he need not be a resident of the city or state, but during his tenure of office
he shall reside in the city. No council member shall be eligible for
appointment as city manager during the term for which he has been elected, or
for one year thereafter.
SECTION 4.02. DUTIES OF THE CITY MANAGER.
   The city manager shall be the chief executive and administrative officer of
the city. He shall be responsible to the council for the proper administration
of all affairs of the city and, to that end, subject to the provisions of this
charter, he shall have authority and shall be required to:
   (1)    See that this charter and the ordinances and resolutions of the city
are faithfully observed and enforced;
   (2)    Appoint, and when necessary for the good of the service, remove all
officers and employees of the city, not selected or appointed by the council,
in accordance with this Charter and generally applicable law;
   (3)    Prepare the tax budget and the annual budget, submit them to the
council for approval, and administer the appropriations made by the council;
   (4)    Prepare and submit to the council and to the public annually, not
later than March 31, a complete report on the finances and administrative
activities of the city for the preceding year; this report shall be deemed to
satisfy the requirements of Section 117.19 of the Ohio Revised Code without
separate publication of the financial statement;
   (5)    Keep the council informed of the current financial condition and
future needs of the city;
   (6)    Serve as an ex-officio member, (without vote) of the Planning
Commission;
   (7)    Appoint such citizen advisory committees as seem to him desirable and
discharge them when in his judgment their function has been completely served;
   (8)    Delegate to subordinate officers and employees of the city any duties
conferred upon him by this charter or by action of council, and hold them
responsible for their faithful discharge;
   (9)    Perform such other duties, not inconsistent with this charter, as may
be required by the council.
      (Amended 11-5-24)
SECTION 4.03. ABSENCE OR DISABILITY OF THE CITY MANAGER.
   The city manager may designate, by letter filed with the clerk of council,
any qualified administrative officer of the city to perform his duties during
his temporary absence or disability. If such a designation has not been made,
and the city manager is unable to perform his duties or to make such a
designation, the council may, by resolution, appoint any qualified
administrative officer of the city to perform the duties of the city manager
until he shall return or his disability cease.
SECTION 4.04. REMOVAL OF THE CITY MANAGER.
   The city manager shall serve for an indefinite term, subject to removal by
the council at any time by a five-sevenths majority vote of all the members
elected thereto. At least thirty days before such removal shall become
effective, the council shall adopt a preliminary resolution stating the reasons
for the removal. The city manager may reply in writing and may request a public
hearing, which shall be held not earlier than twenty days nor later than thirty
days after the filing of the request, before the full council. After such
public hearing, if one is requested, after full consideration, the council may
adopt a final resolution of removal. By the preliminary resolution the council
may suspend the city manager from duty and designate an acting city manager,
but shall cause to be paid to the city manager forthwith any salary due him up
to the date of his suspension. Upon removal, unless for misconduct of the city
manager involving moral turpitude, he shall be paid his salary for the period
of suspension from duty and for the next one month following the removal. In
case of the voluntary resignation of the city manager, the council and the city
manager shall agree upon the effective date of the resignation.
SECTION 4.05. COUNCIL: RELATION TO CITY MANAGER.
   Except for the purpose of inquiry or investigation, the members of the
council shall deal with the administrative employees of the city solely through
the city manager. No member of council shall take the initiative in the
appointment or removal of officers or employees subordinate to the city
manager. Neither the council nor any member or committee thereof shall give any

available income for the year plus available fund balances will not be at least
equal to the appropriations, he shall reconsider all work programs and
appropriations and recommend to the council that they be revised to prevent
expenditures in excess of income. The council may, after public hearing held

   (a)    The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein. (ORC
1.57)
   (b)    An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)    The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not,
except as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)    Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)    Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)    Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)    Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any

the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the

   (d)    If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced
by a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or

   (a)    A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof. (ORC 1.55)
   (b)    If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included. (ORC 1.56)
   (c)    Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)    If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)    If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)    (1)    If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)    If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)    In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)    Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)    The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
   (b)    An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)    If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)    The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history;
      (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance. (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. (ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation continues or occurs.

shall be brought to the attention of Council by the Clerk, and Council shall
take such further action in the premises as it may deem best.
   X.  MOTIONS, WHEN DEBATABLE; WITHDRAWAL. All motions shall be placed before
Council for its consideration without the necessity for a second thereto.
   When a motion is made, it shall be stated by the presiding officer before

be withdrawn by the movers thereof at any time before decisions, if a majority
of the members then present shall agree thereto.
   XI. DIVISION OF QUESTION. Any member may call for a division of the
question, or the presiding office may direct the same, and in either case, the
same shall be divided if it comprehends questions so distinct that one being
taken away, the other will stand as an entire question for decision.

subject to a standing committee, or to a select committee, the question of
reference to a standing committee shall be put first.

their final passage, may be referred to the Committee on Rules and Ordinances.
It shall be the duty of such Committee as to any ordinance so referred to it,
to carefully compare the same with all existing ordinances, upon the subject
matter, and it shall report thereon any discrepancy or conflict which may exist
therewith. It shall also examine and report upon the form of such discrepancy
or conflict or to correct error in form. If any amendment shall be made to any
ordinance after the Committee has reported thereon the ordinance may before its
final passage be recommitted to such Committee for further report thereon.
   XVII. REFERENCE TO COMMITTEES. Any report, resolution, ordinance or matter
before Council for consideration, except appropriation ordinances, before their
final passage may be referred to a committee specially appointed by the Mayor.

   XXII. ROBERT'S RULES OF ORDER. In the absence of any rule upon the matter of
business, Council shall be governed by Robert's Rules of Order.

   (b)    The Personnel Officer, in conjunction with department and division
heads and subject to the approval of the City Manager, shall annually review
and make recommendations to Council for changes in the following schedule.
   (c)   The adopted position and salary schedule shall provide the basis for
compensation of all municipal employees. The City Manager shall adopt an
administrative policy, subject to approval of the City Council, to address
those positions which are in existence and have not attained the minimum base

is subject to administrative policy. Prior to appointment of a new employee,
the City Manager shall consult the position and salary schedule for
determination of placement within the relevant classification. Appointments

compensation for such employee's authorized overtime, the City Manager shall be
authorized but not required to allow such request.
   The City Manager shall be authorized, but not required, to grant
compensatory time off to those administrative employees not entitled to
overtime compensation at such times and to such extent that the City Manager,
in his sole discretion deems justifiable under the circumstances relating to
each such administrative employee.

rate for each such twenty-four (24) hour period that the employee is on call.

Personnel Officer and division head. The Personnel Officer shall determine the
content of the examinations and shall be responsible for the evaluation of the
results. Examinations shall be competitive unless the Personnel Officer finds
that the number of persons qualified for promotion is insufficient to justify
competition, in which case the promotional examination shall be noncompetitive
in character, or as otherwise provided in Section
8.09 of the Charter. The Personnel Officer shall give written notice of the
promotional examination which shall set forth the date, time and place and
procedures and rules, as determined by the Personnel Officer which apply to the

having attained the age of twenty-one (21) years, shall have their name
included on such list with a notation that they are not eligible for
appointment until having attained the age of twenty-one (21). Whenever it

existing list which is to be merged with a new list in the order of their

while the original employment eligible list from which they were appointed is
still in effect, shall be restored to their original place on that list.

      (1)   Fails to report or arrange within six (6) days (Sundays and
holidays excluded) for an interview with an appointing authority;

      (3)   Declines an appointment without reasons satisfactory to the
Personnel Officer; or
      (4)   Cannot be located by the postal authorities,

   (f)   If at any time after the creation of an eligible list, the Personnel
Officer has reason to believe that any person whose name appears on any list is
disqualified for appointment because of false statements made in their
application, physical disability or for other comparable reasons, such person
shall be notified and given an opportunity to be heard. If such person fails to
appear for hearing, or upon being heard, fails to satisfy the Personnel
Officer, their name shall be removed from such eligible list.

be for a probationary period as agreed to in the collective bargaining
agreements.

probationary period, provided the evaluations indicate satisfactory performance
of their duties.

probationary period. Such removals or demotions shall not be subject to appeal.
Copies of all such notices shall be filed with the Personnel Officer and
Director of Finance.

such as suspension from duty without pay, demotion in rank and salary and
dismissal, shall be exercised only by the City Manager.
   (b)   The duty of maintaining discipline among the City employees shall rest
primarily with the City Manager.
   (c)   An appeal shall be allowed from disciplinary action as provided in the
Charter, Administrative Code and in this chapter, if requested by the non-

in the number of employees of the City, the City Manager shall determine the
classes of employment in which such reduction shall be made and the number to
be laid off. The employees to be laid off shall be determined by the department
and division head based on length of service. Such determination shall be
submitted to the City Manager for action.
   (b)   When the work or financial situation permits, those who have been laid
off shall be called back to work by the City Manager according to their status
on the re-employment eligibility list and placed on available work at the
appropriate pay.

   (a)    Each full-time employee whose salary or wage is paid in whole or in
part by the City shall be entitled, for each completed month of service, to
sick leave of one and one- quarter (1.25) work days with pay. Full-time
employees are entitled to accumulate an unlimited amount of sick leave.
Employees with accumulated sick leave may use such sick leave, upon approval of
the responsible department head, for absence due to illness, injury, exposure
to contagious disease which could be communicated to other employees or for
illness of a spouse or dependent child. A full-time salaried employee who
transfers from one City department to another shall be credited with the unused
balance of their accumulated sick leave. The responsible department head may
require an employee taking sick leave to furnish a satisfactory affidavit that
their absence was caused by illness due to any causes mentioned in this
section. For absences in excess of three (3) consecutive days, the responsible
department head shall notify human resources and human resources will follow up
with the employee. This section shall be uniformly administered to full-time
and part-time employees.
   
   (b)    Effective January 1, 2009, a full-time employee who retires from
service with the City may request and shall be paid an amount equal to one
day's compensation, at their then current salary, for every three (3) day's
sick leave accumulated while employed by the City of Huron as of the date of
retirement, but not to exceed an amount equal to their salary or wage for four
hundred eighty (480) hours. This benefit shall only be available to full-time
employees who qualify for, and actually take retirement through, their
respective public retirement system. No payment for accumulated sick leave
shall be available for, and shall not be paid to, full-time employees who
resign or are terminated from their employment with the City. No payment for
transferred sick leave will be paid at retirement or separation.
   
   (c)    A full-time employee who has a minimum of 1,000 hours accumulated
sick leave by the end of December of the preceding year may request, in
writing, by the last working day of January of any calendar year on a sick
leave conversion form provided by the Finance Department and shall be granted
the right to convert one-hundred twenty (120) hours sick leave to forty (40)
hours personal time. An Employee shall not convert in excess of sixty-four (64)
hours personal time on any calendar year.(40 hours of converted sick time and
twenty-four (24) regular personal hours). Transferred sick time will not be
included in the sick leave conversion to personal time.
   
   (d)    Each full-time employee shall be allowed to transfer accumulate
unused sick leave accrued while in the employment of another Ohio political
subdivision, but the transferred time ("transferred sick") cannot be computed
towards payouts, personal time conversion, carryovers or donated time.
Transferred sick time cannot be used until all regular accrued sick leave is
exhausted. This transferred sick leave will never be paid out at retirement or
separation and cannot be used to donate leave.
(Ord. 2023-23. Passed 8-22-23.)
163.03 BEREAVEMENT LEAVE.
   (a)    A maximum of four (4) days leave of absence shall be granted to any

sister, brother, spouse, child, stepson, stepdaughter, stepbrother, stepsister,
stepparent, half-brother, half-sister, grandparent, mother-in-law and father-
in-law) and such time shall not be deducted from the employee's accumulated
sick leave.
   (b)    A maximum of three (3) days' leave of absence shall be granted to any
full-time employee due to a death in the following members of their family:
aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews. Such time shall be deducted from their
accumulated sick leave.
   (c)   When, in the opinion of the responsible department head, additional
leave of absence for family death is in the best interest of both the City and
the employee, such additional leave may be granted and shall be deducted from
the employee's accumulated sick leave.
(Ord. 2023-23. Passed 8-22-23.)
163.04 PAID HOLIDAYS.

be considered as the legal holiday. In the event the holiday falls on Sunday,

foregoing, should Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve fall on a Sunday, the Friday
preceding shall be considered the legal holiday. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

carryover shall be limited according to the chart. Upon employment separation
or retirement, an employee's vacation leave balance is paid out at the

Chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
ORC, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this Chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the ORC and the use is not consistent, then the use of the
term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall
control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC.
   (B)    The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall
include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   (C)    As used in this Chapter:
      (1)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file

corporation under (C)(24)(d) of this division, means a C corporation's federal
taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
         (a)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
         (b)   Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (C)(1)(a) of this Section, but excluding that portion
of intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of property described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (c)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;

deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
            (ii)   Division (C)(1)(d)(i) of this Section does not apply to the

         (h)   (i)    Except as limited by divisions (C)(1)(h)(ii), (iii), and
(iv) of this Section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a
taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
            (ii)    No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (C)

            (iii)   (a)    For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020,

to (C)(1)(h) of this Section.
            (v)    Nothing in division (C)(1)(h)(iii)(a) of this Section
precludes a person from carrying forward, for use with respect to any return
filed for a taxable year beginning after 2018, any amount of net operating loss
that was not fully utilized by operation of division (C)(1)(h)(iii)(a) of this
Section. To the extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully
utilized in one or more taxable years by operation of division (C)(1)(h)(iii)

described in division (C)(1)(h)(iii)(a) of this Section shall apply to the
amount carried forward.

income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in

Section

         (j)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly
or indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable

 185.05.

made an election described in division (C)(48)(b) of this Section, is not a
publicly traded partnership that has made the election described in division

compute adjusted federal taxable income under this Section as if the taxpayer
were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid
or accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless
such payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as
payment of interest under Section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United
States treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-
employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer,
amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts

federal self-employment tax.

            (ii)    If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the
Municipality each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         (d)    "Refundable credit" means the amount of the Municipality's
income tax that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    If, in addition to the income tax levied by the Municipality, a
taxpayer has paid tax to other municipal corporations with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the credit that a
taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be calculated on the
basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of the total
municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all municipal
corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
Section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the
Municipality for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
      (4)    The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         (b)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

Municipality for all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled
in the Municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year
or if the Tax Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is
domiciled in the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described
in division (E)(1)(a) of this Section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
       (2)    For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled
in the Municipality for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be

to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         (i)    The number of contact periods the individual has with the
Municipality. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact
period" with the Municipality if the individual is away overnight from the
individual's abode located outside of the Municipality and while away overnight
from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the Municipality.
      (3)    All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.
Businesses.
   (F)    This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the Municipality, unless the taxpayer is an individual who is a
resident or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or telephone
company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter 5745. of
the ORC.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (F)(2) and (G) of this
Section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
185.04(C);
         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
       (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1)
of this Section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
185.12(A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
Section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
185.12(A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this Section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)    As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this Section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:

            (ii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or
a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            (iii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in (F)(3)(a)(ii) of this Section, or a related member of such a
vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
           (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
Section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)    For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this Section, and except
as provided in division (G) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:

the following criteria:
            (i)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the
Municipality from a stock of goods located within the Municipality.
            (ii)    The property is delivered within the Municipality from a
location outside the Municipality, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            (iii)    The property is shipped from a place within the
Municipality to purchasers outside the Municipality, provided that the taxpayer
is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or
promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in the
Municipality.
         (c)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to the
Municipality.
         (d)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to
the Municipality.
         (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Municipality based upon the extent to which
the tangible personal property is used in the Municipality.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Municipality's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Municipality or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the
Municipality. the Municipality shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Municipality, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
Municipality to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the Municipality shall
report the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the
individual's annual income tax return filed with the Municipality. The
individual may claim a credit for taxes the individual paid on such net profit
to another municipal corporation to the extent that such a credit is allowed
under this Chapter.
      (7)    When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1) of this
Section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this Section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (8)    Intentionally left blank.

   (G)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
185.04 of this Chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
185.04 of this Chapter.

Withholding provisions.
   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the Municipality shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying
wages earned and/or received by each employee in the Municipality. Except for
qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under Section
 185.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this Section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
 185.03 of this Chapter, of one percent (1%). An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this Section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Municipality in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or
if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted
and withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the preceding
calendar quarter exceeded $200.
Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this Section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the
last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
          (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this Section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of
each calendar quarter.
         (c)    Notwithstanding the provisions of (B)(1)(a)and (b) of this
Section, taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the Municipality in the
preceding calendar year exceeded $11,999, or if in any month of the preceding
calendar year exceeded $1,000. Payment under division (B)(1)(c) of this Section
shall be made so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not
later than one of the following: (i) if the taxes were deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld during the first fifteen days of a month,
the third banking day after the fifteenth day of that month; or (ii) if the
taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld after
the fifteenth day of a month and before the first day of the immediately
following month, the third banking day after the last day of the month.
       (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Municipality. The payment of
tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an
employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required
under this Section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and the Municipality as the
return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the
tax under this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Municipality's income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
       (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
income tax or income tax withholding requirement imposed by this Chapter to the
extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the
time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages the tax levied by this Chapter was
withheld or should have been withheld during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this Section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this Section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Municipality's
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this Section.

employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report

"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this Section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this Section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this Section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

Section, an employer is not required to withhold the Municipality's income tax
on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal
services in the Municipality if the employee performed such services in the
Municipality on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the
following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Municipality.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Municipality. For the purposes of this division,
"presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in the Municipality at which the employer provides or provided
services that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the employer

performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this Section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Municipality only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Municipality than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more
of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the
employee's principal place of work:
            (i)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first

      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this Section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described

Municipality.
       (5)    If an employer's fixed location is in the Municipality and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section

To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the

      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this Section shall not apply to the
extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
 185.04. (Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-10-15.)
185.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual Municipal income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
185.04 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is owed to the Municipality.
      (2)    Retirees having no municipal taxable income for purposes of the
tax levied by this Chapter may file with the Tax Administrator a written
exemption from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax
Administrator. The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and
the entity from which retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time
as the retiree receives municipal taxable income taxable by the Municipality,
at which time the retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable
provisions of this Chapter.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Municipality, the return or notice required of that individual
shall be completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent,
guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the
person or property of that individual.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.
   (E)    The Municipality shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual
to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of the
following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2,
"Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's
federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and, with
respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to support
the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files
the annual return required by this Section electronically is not required to
provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
       (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this Section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form

to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this Section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         
   (G)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each return
required to be filed under this section shall be completed and filed as
required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed for the
filing of state individual income tax returns under division (G) of Section
5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice
on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to Municipality. No remittance is required if the net
amount due is ten dollars or less.
       (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of Municipality's income tax
return. The extended due date of Municipality's income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended
due date of Municipality's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an
individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of
the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file
under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless
the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of Municipality's income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's Municipality income tax return. If the request is
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipality income
tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested
extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of
Municipality's income tax return. The extended due date of Municipality's
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by Municipality, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
         If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net
amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this Section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this Section.
   (I)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
185.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
185.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Municipality, unless the amounts withheld were
not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Municipality, provided
that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the Municipality or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or
tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the
provisions of this Chapter and of the Municipality's ordinance, resolution, or
rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file municipal
income tax return required under this Chapter, the estimated municipal income
tax return, or a request for extension for filing the municipal income tax
return, and may make payment of amounts shown to be due on such returns, by
using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)    Nothing in this Section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality during the
period of the member's or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter.
The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after
the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such
evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this Section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
        (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this Section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the Municipality before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this Section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (P)(2)(a)
of this Section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a
member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called
to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the president of
the United States or an act of the congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
          (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division
(P)(2)(a) of this Section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this Section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
Section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this Section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing

Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)    As used in this Section:
       (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.

purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(1) of this Section.

taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the
Municipality's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this Section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
        (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this Section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this Section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this Section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Municipality. A taxpayer that is required to
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for all subsequent taxable
years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the
Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.

taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
 185.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
 185.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Municipality. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the

Section
185.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Municipality. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
185.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Municipality;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to Municipality income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Municipality income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
185.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that Section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that Section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
Chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Municipality before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Municipality may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if

         (a)    Taxes withheld for the Municipality from qualifying wages shall
be considered as paid to the Municipality in equal amounts on each payment date
unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually
withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which
the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
185.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
185.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this Section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this Section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this Section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this Section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Municipality under Section
185.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-10-15.)
185.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-10-15.)
185.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this Section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
185.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this Section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (C)(3) of this Section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
185.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this Section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
185.18(A)(4). (Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-10-15.)
185.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the Municipality, but should
have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Municipality
as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Municipality is subject to recovery by the
Municipality. If the Municipality's tax on that income is imposed after the
time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other
municipality, the Municipality shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the
tax or withholding the Municipality claims is due with respect to such income
or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with
respect to such income or wages.
   (C)    If the Municipality's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Municipality's tax rate. However, if the Municipality's tax rate is greater
than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the
nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the Municipality, along with any penalty
and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this Section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-10-15.)
185.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Municipality changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with the Municipality. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by
the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
185.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
Section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
185.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's tax liability to the Municipality, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Municipality return showing income
subject to the Municipality income tax based upon such final determination of
federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional
Municipality income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars.
(Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-10-15.)
185.12  LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
                (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was
filed, whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this Section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this Section.
      (2)    As used in this Section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
185.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
185.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
185.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
 185.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover Municipality income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-10-15.)
185.13 AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
    (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an
attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this Section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this Section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 2015-30.
Passed 11-10-15.)
185.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this Section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this Section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this Section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Municipality official, or
the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (C)(1)(a) of this Section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
       (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
Section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this Section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this Section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this Section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
Section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
       (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this Section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Municipality
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this Section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this Section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this Section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-10-15.)
185.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this Section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the Municipality's income tax
imposed in accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. (Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-10-15.)
185.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Municipality
as authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the Ohio tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This Section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-10-15.)
185.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Chapter or state law to be
filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax Administrator. (Ord. 2015-
30. Passed 11-10-15.)

taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to the Municipality on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)    This Section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the Municipality to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be

memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,

      (4)    Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax

      (5)    Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to

withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this Section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and

subject to, the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding of such
tax.
       (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.

compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this Section
shall fail to comply.

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this Chapter

the request was directed pursuant to Section
185.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
185.99. 
           (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
185.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
 185.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this Section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
 185.99 for a violation of Section
 185.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.

subject to appeal. (Ord. 2015-30. Passed 11-10-15.)

members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,

with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years (which
applies only to these two appointments) immediately preceding the date of
appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor of the Municipality.
This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director
of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar
official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any
direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review shall be two

member is reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed
by the Mayor of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of the
administrative official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.

meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this Section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.

as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the

remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.

Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
Section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax

provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this Section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this Section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.

      (Ord. 2019-34. Passed 3-10-20.)
189.03 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)    For the purpose of providing revenue for the purpose set forth in
Section
189.01, an excise tax is levied on transactions by which lodging by a hotel or
Transient Rental Property is made available for rent, use, or is to be
furnished to Transient Guests.
   (b)    The tax is three percent (3%) on all rents paid or to be paid by
Transient Guests for the use of a Hotel, any Hotel room or rooms, or any
Transient Rental Property. Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the Transient
Guest to the City, which debt is extinguished only by payment to the operator
as trustee for the City, or to the City. The tax applies and is collectible at
the time the lodging is furnished regardless of the time when the rent is paid.
The tax shall be assessed on all rents paid or to be paid by Transient Guests
for use of any Transient Rental Property beginning May 1, 2020.
   (c)    For the purpose of the proper administration of this Chapter and to
prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all lodging furnished by
hotels in the City to Transient Guests is subject to the tax until the contrary
is established.
(Ord. 2019-34. Passed 3-10-20.)
189.04 EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)    No tax shall be imposed under this chapter on:
      (1)    Rents not within the taxing power of the City under the
Constitution or laws of the State or the United States of America; or
      (2)    Rents paid by the City or any of its political subdivisions.
   (b)    No exemption claimed under (a) above shall be granted except on a
claim therefor made at the time the rent is collected and under penalty of
perjury on a form prescribed by the Administrator. All claims of exemption
shall be made in the manner prescribed by the Administrator. (Ord. 2005-2.
Passed 1-24-05.)
189.05 FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX-EXEMPT STATUS.
   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full tax as required by this
chapter or present to the operator false evidence indicating that the lodging
as furnished is not subject to the tax.
(Ord. 2005-2. Passed 1-24-05.)
189.06 PAYMENT BY TRANSIENT GUEST.
   (a)    The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest
to the operator, and each operator shall collect from the transient guest the
full and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
   (b)    If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must
furnish to the operator, and the operator must obtain from the transient guest,
a certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed that the tax applies.
(Ord. 2005-2. Passed 1-24-05.)
189.07 STATEMENT AND CHARGE OF TAX.
   (a)    The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and on every evidence of
occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for such occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator. The tax shall be paid by the occupant Transient
Guest to the Operator as trustee for and on account of the City and the
Operator shall be liable for the collection thereof and for the remittance of
the tax to the Administrator.
   (b)    No operator of a Hotel, Dwelling Unit, Residential Premises, or any
other property being utilized or otherwise made available for rent to Transient
Guests shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly,
that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the Operator,
or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be
refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 2019-34. Passed 3-10-20.)
189.08 REGISTRATION.
   Within thirty days after the effective date of Ordinance 2005-2, passed
January 24, 2005 or within thirty days after commencing business, whichever is
later, each operator of any hotel renting lodging to transient guests shall
register the hotel with the Administrator and obtain a Transient Occupancy
Registration Certificate, which Certificate shall be at all times posted in a
conspicuous place on the premises.
(Ord. 2019-34. Passed 3-10-20.)
189.09 RECORDS.
   Each operator shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and other pertinent
documents. If the operator furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the
operator's records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale
was not exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction
if exempted for any other reason. The records and other documents shall be
opened during business hours to the inspection of the Administrator and shall
be preserved for a period of three years, unless the Administrator, in writing,
consents to their destruction within that period, or unless the Administrator
orders that such records be kept for a longer period of time.
(Ord. 2005-2. Passed 1-24-05.)
189.10 RETURNS AND PAYMENT.
   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the
close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period
that may be established by the Administrator, make a return to the
Administrator, on forms provided by the Administrator, of the total rents
charged and received and the amount of tax collected by transient occupancies.
All claims for exemption from tax filed by transient guests with the operator
during the reporting period shall be filed with the report. At the time the
return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the
Administrator. The Administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for
any Certificate holder if the Administrator deems it necessary in order to
insure collection of the tax, and the Administrator may require further
information in the return if such information is pertinent to the collection of
the tax. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business
for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this Chapter shall
be held in trust for the account of the City until payment is made to the
Administrator. All returns and payments submitted by each operator shall be
treated as confidential by the Administrator and shall not be released by the
Administrator except on order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an
officer or agent of the United States of America, the State, the County of Erie
or the City for official use only.
(Ord. 2005-2. Passed 1-24-05.)
189.11 PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (a)    Original delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this Chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to 10% of
the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (b)    Continued delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittance on or before a period of 30 days following the date on which the
remittance became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty equal to
10% of the amount of the tax and previous penalty in addition to the tax and
the 10% penalty first imposed. An additional penalty equal to 10% of the total
tax and penalty of the previous 30-day period shall be added for each
successive 30-day period that the occupant remains delinquent, but the
accumulated penalty shall not exceed 100% of the delinquent remittance.
   (c)    Fraud. If the Administrator determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to 25% of
the amount of the tax shall be added thereto, in addition to the penalties
stated in (a) and (b) above.
   (d)    Interest. In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the
rate of 1.0% per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax,
exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance frst became
delinquent until paid.
   (e)    Penalties during pendency of hearing or appeal. No penalty provided
under the terms of this Chapter shall be imposed during the pendency of any
hearing provided for herein or during the pendency of any appeal to the Board
of Review.
(Ord. 2005-2. Passed 1-24-05.)
189.12 FAILURE TO COLLECT; ASSESSMENTS; REFUNDS.
   If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the
time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Administrator shall proceed in
such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to
base his estimate of the tax due and shall have the same investigative powers
described in Section
185.09(a) and (b). As soon as the Administrator procures such facts and
information as the Administrator is able to obtain on which to base the
assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who
has failed or refused to collect it and to make such report and remittance, the
Administrator shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the
tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such
determination is made, the Administrator shall give a notice of the amount so
assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at the operator's
last known place of business. Such operator may, within ten days after the
serving or mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the
Administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the
operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax,
interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Administrator shall become
final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is
made, the Administrator shall give not less than five days written notice in
the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place
fixed in such notice why such amount specified therein should not be fixed for
such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and
offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so
fixed. After the hearing, the Administrator shall determine the proper tax to
be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the
manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax,
interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after
15 days unless an appeal is taken as provided by Section
189.13. No assessment shall be made against an operator for any tax, interest
or penalty imposed by or pursuant to this Chapter more than four years after
the due date for the remittance of the tax imposed by this Chapter or the date
the return of such tax is filed, whichever is later. No statute of limitation
on assessments exists where (i) the Administrator has substantial evidence of
amounts of tax collected by an operator from transient guests that were not
returned to the Administrator or (ii) the operator failed to file a return as
required by this Chapter. A claim for refund to the Administrator of any tax
illegally or erroneously paid, collected and/or remitted shall be made in the
manner, and within the time, prescribed by Ohio R.C. 5739.07, including any
amendments or successor provisions thereto. (Ord. 2005-2. Passed 1-24-05.)
  
189.13 APPEALS.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Administrator with respect to
the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the Board
of Review by filing a notice of appeal with it within ten days of the serving
or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Board of Review shall fix a
time and place for hearing the appeal, and shall give notice in writing to such
operator at the last known place of business of the operator. The findings of
the Board of Review shall be final and conclusive and shall be served on the
appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any
amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of
notice.
(Ord. 2005-2. Passed 1-24-05.)
189.14 COLLECTION.
   Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest under the provisions of
this Chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the City.
Any tax collected by an operator that has not been paid to the City shall be
deemed a debt owed by the operator to the City. Any person owing money to the
City under the provisions of this Chapter shall be liable to an action brought
in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount.
(Ord. 2005-2. Passed 1-24-05.)
189.15 COLLECTION OF TAX AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   This chapter shall continue effective insofar as the levy of the tax is
concerned until revoked, and insofar as the collection of the tax levied
hereunder and actions or proceedings for collecting any tax so levied or
enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall continue
effective until all of such taxes levied in the aforesaid period are fully paid
and any and all suits and prosecutions for the collection of such taxes or for
the punishment of violations of this chapter have been fully terminated,
subject to the limitations contained in Section
189.99.
(Ord. 2005-2. Passed 1-24-05.)
189.16 DISPOSITION OF FUNDS COLLECTED.
   By the passage of this chapter, it is the expressed intention of Council to
place the funds derived from the imposition of the tax herein imposed in the
general fund, such funds to be used as set forth in Section
189.01.
(Ord. 2005-2. Passed 1-24-05.)
189.17 SEPARABILITY.    
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter or any tax against
any individual or any of the several groups specified herein is found to be
unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such unconstitutionality, illegality or
invalidity shall affect only such clause, sentence, section or part of this
chapter and shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions,
sentences, clauses, sections or other parts of this chapter. It is hereby
declared to be the intention of Council that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included herein.
(Ord. 2005-2. Passed 1-24-05.)
189.99 VIOLATIONS; PENALTY.
   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of Sections
189.01 through
189.17 for which no penalty is otherwise provided is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor. Each day the violation continues shall be deemed a separate
violation.

vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under

Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be

fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation

court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and

evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.

or injure any person, vehicle or animal traveling along or upon such highway,
except such substances that may be placed upon the roadway by proper authority
for the repair or construction thereof.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates any provision of subsections (a) to (d) of this section is guilty of a
minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one predicate motor vehicle or
traffic offense, whoever violates any provision of subsections (a) to (d) of
this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one

procession upon any street or highway, or block off any street or highway area,
without first obtaining a permit from the City Manager, or his authorized
designee. Applications for such permits shall be submitted using the
corresponding City application form and shall include a site plan of location
or parade route and any other information as is reasonably necessary to make a
fair determination of whether a permit should be issued. Applications shall be
filed not less than five days before the time intended for such parade,
procession or assemblage.
   The permit may be refused or cancelled if:
(Ord. 2024-8. Passed 4-23-24.)
      (1)   The time, place, size or conduct of the parade including the
assembly areas and route of march would unreasonably interfere with the public
convenience and safe use of the streets and highways.
      (2)   The parade would require the diversion of so great a number of
police officers to properly police the line of movement, assembly area and
areas contiguous thereto so as to deny normal police protection to the
Municipality.
      (3)   The parade route of march or assembly areas would unreasonably
interfere with the movement of police vehicles, fire-fighting equipment or
ambulance service to other areas of the Municipality.
      (4)   The parade would unreasonably interfere with another parade for
which a permit has been issued.
      (5)   The information contained in the application is found to be false,
misleading or incomplete in any material detail.
      (6)   An emergency such as a fire or storm would prevent the proper
conduct of the parade.
   The permit or any order accompanying it may limit or prescribe reasonable
conditions, including the hours, the place of assembly and of dispersal, the
route of march or travel and the streets, highways or portions thereof which
may be used or occupied.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second offense within one year after the first offense, the

vehicle, skateboard or similar device shall go upon any roadway except while
crossing a street on a crosswalk and except on streets set aside as play
streets.
   
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second offense within one year after the first offense, the
person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on each subsequent
offense within one year after the first offense, the person is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree. (A.O.)
   (c)   An e-scooter is not considered a toy vehicle for purposes of this
Section.
(Ord. 2021-25. Passed 7-13-21.)

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section 
313.05 , pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the

thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by

use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall

vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.

ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense

under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.

Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine
that the offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other
conditions of community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is

construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:
            1.    Any school chartered under Ohio R.C. 3301.16;
            2.    Any nonchartered school that during the preceding year filed

and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared

designation of this offense as a strict liability offense shall not be
construed to imply that any other offense, for which there is no specified

superseding a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance that prescribes
penalties for violations of that ordinance that are greater than the penalties
prescribed in this section for violations of this section.
   (f)    A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of a substantially

Ohio Revised Code.

device;
         B.   Confiscate the device while awaiting the issuance of a warrant to
access the device;

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

or parking knowing the operator does not have a valid driver’s license issued
to the operator by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles or a Deputy Registrar under
Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a valid commercial driver’s license issued under Ohio
R.C. Chapter 4506.
   (b)   (1)   No person shall receive a driver’s license, or a motorcycle

instruction permit, or identification card unless and until the person
surrenders to the Registrar or a deputy registrar all valid licenses, temporary
instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together
with information that the license, temporary instruction permit, or
identification card is now issued in this state. The Registrar or a deputy
registrar shall destroy any such license, temporary instruction permit, or
identification card that is not returned to the issuing authority.
      (3)   No person shall possess more than one valid license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card at any time.
         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

offense.

attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months
or the date the holder attains the age of seventeen years, whichever occurs

      (2)   Any person who is subject to the operating restrictions established
under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or
subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the violation may
terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under
subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
   (d)   No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon
a highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking unless the total number of occupants of the vehicle
does not exceed the total number of occupant restraining devices originally
installed in the motor vehicle by its manufacturer, and each occupant of the
vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or
is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.
   (g)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Occupant restraining device” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.
4513.263.
      (2)   “Family member” of a probationary license holder includes any of
the following:
         A.   A spouse;

         F.   A son or daughter of the probationary license holder’s stepparent
if the stepparent has not adopted the probationary license holder;
         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets. “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a

335.032 USE OF ELECTRONIC WIRELESS COMMUNICATION DEVICE PROHIBITED WHILE
DRIVING.
   (a)   No holder of a temporary instruction permit who has not attained the
age of eighteen years and no holder of a probationary driver’s license shall
drive a motor vehicle on any street, highway, or property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular traffic or parking while using in any manner an
electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

other sentence that it imposes on the offender may order the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11, or any
combination of three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4501.11 or Ohio R.C.

declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having
jurisdiction of the offense that lead to the order terminates the forfeiture

necessary measures to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased
by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or

nonresident operating privileges are suspended as a repeat traffic offender
under this section and who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle
upon any public roads and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point
suspension, a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the
offender to a minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the
first three days of jail time imposed pursuant to this subsection. (ORC

on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of

   No person shall operate or permit to be operated, any vessel in violation of
this rule.
(OAC 1501:47-2-05)
 
381.06 SAFE SPEED.
   Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that it can take
proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance
appropriate to the prevailing
circumstances and conditions.
   In determining a safe speed the following factors shall be among those taken
into account:
   (a)    By all vessels:
      (1)    The state of visibility.
      (2)    The traffic density including concentration of fishing vessels or
any other vessels.
      (3)    The maneuverability of the vessel with special reference to
stopping distance and turning ability in the prevailing conditions.
      (4)    At night the presence of background light such as from shore
lights or from back scatter of its own lights.
      (5)    The state of wind, sea, and current, and the proximity of
navigational hazards.
      (6)    The draft in relation to the available depth of water.
   (b)    Additionally, by vessels with operational radar:
      (1)    The characteristics, efficiency and limitations of the radar
equipment.
      (2)    Any constraints imposed by the radar range scale in use.
(3)    The effect on radar detection of the sea state, weather, and other
sources of interference.
(4)    The possibility that small vessels, ice and other floating objects may
not be detected by radar at an adequate range.
      (5)    The number, location, and movement of vessels detected by radar.
(6)    The more exact assessment of the visibility that may be possible when
radar is used to determine the range of vessels or other objects in the
vicinity.
   (c)   No vessel shall be propelled or operated at a rate greater than six
statute miles per hour in Huron River in the City, extending from the north end
of the Breakwater southerly to the south City limits, except in case of fire or
distress.
      (Ord. 421. Passed 6-22-59.)
   For the purposes of this rule the term "collision" includes every
description of accident or casualty either intentional or unintentional.
   No person shall operate or permit to be operated, any vessel in violation of
this rule.
(OAC 1501:47-2-06)
 
381.07 RISK OF COLLISION.
   (a)   Every vessel shall use all available means appropriate to the
prevailing circumstances and conditions to determine if risk of collision
exists. If there is any doubt such risk shall be deemed to exist.
 
   (b)    Proper use shall be made of radar equipment if fitted and
operational, including long-range scanning to obtain early warning of risk of
collision and radar plotting or equivalent systematic observation of detected
objects.
 
   (c)    Assumptions shall not be made on the basis of scanty information,
especially scanty radar information.
 
   (d)    In determining if risk of collision exists the following
considerations shall be among those taken into account:
(1)    Such risk shall be deemed to exist if the compass bearing of an
approaching vessel does not appreciably change.
(2)    Such risk may sometimes exist even when an appreciable bearing change is
evident, particularly when approaching a very large vessel or a tow or when
approaching a vessel at close range.
   No person shall operate or permit to be operated, any vessel in violation of
this rule.
(OAC 1501:47-2-07)
 
381.08 ACTION TO AVOID COLLISION.
   (a)    Any action taken to avoid collision shall, if the circumstances of
the case admit, be positive, made in ample time and with due regard to the
observance of good seamanship.
 
   (b)    Any alteration of course or speed to avoid collision shall, if the
circumstances of the case admit, be large enough to be readily apparent to
another vessel observing visually or by radar; a succession of small
alterations of course or speed should be avoided.
 
   (c)    If there is sufficient sea room, alteration of course alone may be
the most effective action to avoid a close-quarters situation provided that it
is made in good time, is substantial and does not result in another close-
quarters situation.
 
   (d)    Action taken to avoid collision with another vessel shall be such as
to result in passing at a safe distance. The effectiveness of the action shall
be carefully checked until the other vessel is finally past and clear.
 
   (e)    If necessary to avoid collision or allow more time to assess the
situation, a vessel shall slacken its speed or take all way off by stopping or
reversing its means of propulsion.
 
   No person shall operate or permit to be operated, any vessel in violation of
this rule.
(OAC 1501:47-2-08)
 
381.09 NARROW CHANNELS.
   (a)   (1)    A vessel proceeding along the course of a narrow channel or

      (2)    Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1) hereof and OAC 1501:47-2-14(A),
a power driven vessel operating in narrow channels or fairways on Lake Erie and
its tributaries and proceeding downbound with a following current shall have
the right-of-way over an upbound vessel, shall propose the manner and place of
passage, and shall initiate the maneuvering signals prescribed by OAC 1501:47-
2-34(A)(1), as appropriate. The vessel proceeding upbound against the current
shall hold as necessary to permit safe passing.
 
   (b)    A vessel of less than twenty meters in length or a sailing vessel
shall not impede the passage of a vessel that can safely navigate only within a
narrow channel or fairway.
 
   (c)    A vessel engaged in fishing shall not impede the passage of any other
vessel navigating within a narrow channel or fairway.
 
   (d)    A vessel shall not cross a narrow channel or fairway if such crossing
impedes the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within that
channel or fairway. The latter vessel shall use the danger signal prescribed in
OAC 1501:47-2-34 (D) if in doubt as to the intention of the crossing vessel.
 
   (e)   (1)   In a narrow channel or fairway when overtaking, the vessel
intending to overtake shall indicate its intention by sounding the appropriate
signal prescribed in OAC 1501:47-2-34 (C) and take steps to permit safe
passing. The overtaken vessel, if in agreement, shall sound the same signal. If
in doubt it shall sound the danger signal prescribed in OAC 1501:47-2-34 (D).
      (2)   This rule does not relieve the overtaking vessel of its obligation
under OAC 1501:47-2-13.
 
   (f)    A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a narrow channel or fairway
where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall
navigate with particular alertness and caution and shall sound the appropriate
signal prescribed in OAC 1501:47-2-34(E).
 
   (g)    Every vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid
anchoring in a narrow channel.
 
   (h)    Vessels leaving a dock, boat slip, tie-up space, or mooring shall
yield the right-of-way to all vessels approaching such dock, boat slip, tie-up
space, or mooring.
 
   No person shall operate or permit to be operated, any vessel in violation of
this rule.
(OAC 1501:47-2-09)
 
381.10 VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICES.
   Each vessel required by the "Code of Federal Regulations" to participate in
a vessel traffic service shall comply with the applicable regulations.
(OAC 1501:47-2-10)
 
381.11 SAILING VESSELS.
   (a)    When two sailing vessels are approaching one another, so as to
involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way of the other
as follows:
(1)    When each has the wind on a different side, the vessel which has the
wind on the port side shall keep out of the way of the other.
      (2)    When both have the wind on the same side, the vessel which is to
windward shall keep out of the way of the vessel which is to leeward.
      (3)    If a vessel with the wind on the port side sees a vessel to
windward and cannot determine with certainty whether the other vessel has the
wind on the port or on the starboard side, it shall keep out of the way of the
other.
 
   (b)    For the purpose of this rule the windward side shall be deemed to be
the side opposite to that on which the mainsail is carried or, in the case of a
square-rigged vessel, the side opposite to that on which the largest fore-and-
aft sail is carried.
   No person shall operate or permit to be operated, any vessel in violation of
this rule.
(OAC 1501:47-2-12)
 
381.12 OVERTAKING.
   (a)    Notwithstanding anything contained in rules 1501:47-2-04 to 1501:47-
2-18 of the Ohio Administrative Code, any vessel overtaking any other shall
keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken.
 
   (b)    A vessel shall be deemed to be overtaking when coming up with another
vessel from a direction more than twenty-two and one half degrees abaft its
beam; that is, in such a position with reference to the vessel it is
overtaking, that at night it would be able to only see the sternlight of that
vessel but neither of its sidelights.
 
   (c)    When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether it is overtaking another,
it shall assume that this is the case and act accordingly.
 
   (d)    Any subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels
shall not make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of
these rules or relieve it of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel
until it is finally past and clear.
   No person shall operate or permit to be operated, any vessel in violation of
this rule.
(OAC 1501:47-2-13)
 
381.13 HEAD-ON SITUATION.
   (a)    Unless otherwise agreed, when two power-driven vessels are meeting on
reciprocal or nearly reciprocal courses so as to involve risk of collision each
shall alter its course to starboard so that each shall pass on the port side of
the other.
 
   (b)    Such a situation shall be deemed to exist when a vessel sees the
other ahead or nearly ahead and by night it could see the masthead lights of
the other in a line or nearly in a line or both sidelights and by day it
observes the corresponding aspect of the other vessel.
 
   (c)    When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether such a situation exists
it shall assume that it does exist and act accordingly.
 
   (d)    Notwithstanding subsection (a) hereof, a power-driven vessel
operating on Lake Erie and its tributaries, and proceeding downbound with a
following current shall have the right-of-way over an upbound vessel, shall
propose the manner of passage, and shall initiate the maneuvering signals
prescribed by paragraph (A)(1) of rule 1501:47-2-34 of the Ohio Administrative
Code, as appropriate.
   No person shall operate or permit to be operated, any vessel in violation of
this rule.
(OAC 1501:47-2-14)
 
381.14 CROSSING SITUATION.
   (a)    When two power-driven vessels are crossing so as to involve risk of
collision, the vessel which has the other on its starboard side shall keep out
of the way and shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing
ahead of the other vessel.
 
   (b)    Notwithstanding subsection (a) hereof, on Lake Erie and its
tributaries, a vessel crossing a river shall keep out of the way of a power-
driven vessel ascending or descending the river.
   No person shall operate or permit to be operated, any vessel in violation of
this rule.
(OAC 1501:47-2-15)
 
381.15 ACTION BY GIVE-WAY VESSEL.
   Every vessel which is directed to keep out of the way of another vessel
shall, so far as possible, take early and substantial action to keep well
clear.
   No person shall operate or permit to be operated, any vessel in violation of
this rule.
(OAC 1501:47-2-16)
 
381.16 ACTION BY STAND-ON VESSEL.
   (a)   (1)    Where one of two vessels is to keep out of the way, the other
shall keep its course and speed.
(2)    The latter vessel may, however, take action to avoid collision by its
maneuver alone, as soon as it becomes apparent to it that the vessel required
to keep out of the way is not taking appropriate action in compliance with this
chapter.
 
   (b)    When, from any cause, the vessel required to keep its course and
speed finds itself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of
the give-way vessel alone, it shall take such action as will best aid to avoid
collision.
 
   (c)    A power-driven vessel which takes action in a crossing situation in
accordance with subsection (a) (2) hereof to avoid collision with another
power-driven vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, not alter
course to port for a vessel on its own port side.
 
   (d)    This rule does not relieve the give-way vessel of its obligation to
keep out of the way.
   No person shall operate or permit to be operated, any vessel in violation of
this rule.
(OAC 1501:47-2-17)
 
381.17 RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN VESSELS.
   Except where rules 1501:47-2-09, 1501:47-2-l0, and 1501:47-2-13 of the Ohio

      (2)    A vessel restricted in its ability to maneuver.
      (3)    A vessel engaged in fishing.
(c)    A vessel engaged in fishing when underway shall, so far as possible,
keep out of the way of:
      (1)    A vessel not under command.
      (2)    A vessel restricted in its ability to maneuver.
   (d)    A seaplane on the water shall, in general, keep well clear of all
vessels and avoid impeding their navigation. In circumstances, however, where
risk of collision exists, it shall comply with the rules of this part.
   No person shall operate or permit to be operated, any vessel in violation of
this rule.
(OAC 1501:47-2-18)
 
381.18 CONDUCT OF VESSELS IN RESTRICTED VISIBILITY.
   (a)    This rule applies to vessels not in sight of one another when
navigating in or near an area of restricted visibility.
 
   (b)    Every vessel shall proceed at a safe speed adapted to the prevailing
circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility. A power-driven vessel
shall have its engines ready for immediate maneuver.
 
   (c)    Every vessel shall have due regard to the prevailing circumstances
and conditions of restricted visibility when complying with rules 1501:47-2-04
to 1501:47-2-10 of the Ohio Administrative Code.
 
   (d)    A vessel which detects by radar alone the presence of another vessel
shall determine if a close-quarters situation is developing or risk of
collision exists. If so, it shall take avoiding action in ample time, provided
that when such action consists of an alteration of course, so far as possible
the following shall be avoided: an alteration of course to port for a vessel
forward of the beam, other than for a vessel being overtaken and an alteration
of course toward a vessel abeam or abaft the beam.
 
   (e)    Except where it has been determined that a risk of collision does not
exist, every vessel which hears apparently forward of its beam the fog signal

court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(1) of this section.

child’s attorney, or, if the defendant or child has no attorney, on the
defendant or child.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section

383.01 TAGS INDICATING EXPIRATION DATE; ATTACHMENT OF IDENTIFICATION NUMBER.
   When the Chief of the Division of Watercraft issues a registration
certificate under Ohio R.C. 1547.54, he also shall issue to the applicant two
tags not larger than three inches square, color coded, indicating the
expiration date of the certificate. The owner of watercraft currently
documented by the United States Coast Guard and for which a registration
certificate is issued shall securely affix one tag to the watercraft's port
side and the other tag to the starboard side, so that the tags are clearly
visible under normal operating conditions. The owner of any other watercraft
for which a registration certificate is issued shall securely affix one tag to
the watercraft's port side six inches toward the stern from the identification
number, and the other tag to the starboard side, six inches toward the stern
from the identification number. The tags shall be securely affixed to the
watercraft prior to its operation. A person may operate without a registration
certificate, for a period not to exceed thirty days, any watercraft required to
be titled on the waters in this State, if he has in his possession on the
watercraft a dealer's dated bill of sale or, in the case of a casual sale, a
notarized bill of sale.
   The owner of every watercraft requiring numbering by this State shall attach
to each side of the bow of the watercraft the permanent identification number
in such manner as may be prescribed by applicable federal standards in order
that it shall be clearly visible. The number shall be maintained in a legible
condition at all times. No number other than the number assigned to a
watercraft or granted by reciprocity pursuant to this chapter shall be painted,
attached, or otherwise displayed on either side of the bow of the watercraft.

383.02 DUTIES AFTER COLLISION OR ACCIDENT; ACCIDENT REPORTS.
   The operator of a vessel involved in a collision, accident, or other
casualty, so far as the operator can do so without serious danger to the
operator's own vessel, crew, and passengers, shall render to other persons
affected by the collision, accident, or other casualty such assistance as may
be practicable and as may be necessary in order to save them from or minimize
any danger caused by the collision, accident, or other casualty. The operator
also shall give the operator's name, address, and identification of the
operator's vessel in writing to any person if injured and to the owner of any
property damaged in the collision, accident, or other casualty.
   Any person who renders assistance at the scene of a collision, accident, or
other casualty involving a vessel is not liable in a civil action for damages
or injury to persons or property resulting from any act or omission in
rendering assistance or in providing or arranging salvage, towage, medical
treatment, or other assistance, except that the person is liable for willful or
wanton misconduct in rendering assistance. Nothing in this section precludes
recovery from any tortfeasor causing a collision, accident, or other casualty
of damages caused or aggravated by the rendering of assistance.
   In the case of collision, accident, or other casualty involving a vessel,
the operator thereof, if the collision, accident, or other casualty results in
loss of life, personal injury requiring medical treatment beyond first aid, or
damage to property in excess of five hundred dollars ($500.00), shall file with
the Chief of the Division of Watercraft a full description of the collision,
accident, or other casualty on a form prescribed by the Chief. The report so
filed shall be used for statistical purposes only and shall not be admissible
for any purpose in any civil, criminal, or administrative action at law.
   If the operator of the vessel involved in a collision, accident, or other
casualty is incapacitated, the investigating law enforcement officer shall file
the required form as prescribed by the Chief.

of this Municipality, due to the operation of any vessel, the operator having
knowledge of the accident or collision shall immediately stop the vessel at the
scene of the accident or collision, to the extent that it is safe and
practical, and shall remain at the scene of the accident or collision until he
has given his name and address and, if he is not the owner, the name and
address of the owner of the vessel, together with the registration number of
the vessel, if any, to any person injured in the accident or collision or to
the operator, occupant, owner, or attendant of any vessel damaged in the
accident or collision, or to any law enforcement officer at the scene of the
accident or collision.
   If the injured person is unable to comprehend and record the information
required to be given by this section, the other operator involved in the
accident or collision shall forthwith notify the nearest law enforcement agency
having authority concerning the location of the accident or collision, and his
name, address, and the registration number, if any, of the vessel he was
operating, and then remain at the scene of the accident or collision or at the
nearest location from which notification is possible until a law enforcement
officer arrives, unless removed from the scene by an emergency vehicle operated
by the state or a political subdivision or by an ambulance.
   If the accident or collision is with an unoccupied or unattended vessel, the
operator so colliding with the vessel shall securely attach the information
required to be given in this section, in writing, to a conspicuous place in or
on the unoccupied or unattended vessel.

383.04 ALTERATION OF IDENTIFYING MARKS; FALSE INFORMATION ON APPLICATION.
   No person shall deface or alter any serial number, model designation, or
other identifying mark on any watercraft or motor as placed thereon by the
manufacturer thereof, or remove, deface, or alter the registration number of
any watercraft as the registration number appears on the bow thereof except by
specific order of the Chief of the Division of Watercraft.

   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two

      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.

division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.

delicti remains undiscovered.

have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
 501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 Type of                                     Maximum
Misdemeanor                                   Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section

subsection (c).

   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as

 545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being

545.05, 
545.06 or
545.08, Section

545.05 or

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

deficiencies noted within 120 days of the date such requirement is added.

   (a)    The City, by and through its Zoning Official or his designee shall
have all authority conveyed to it by Ohio Revised Code 715.47 and may fill or
drain any lot or land within its limits on which water at any time becomes
stagnant, remove all putrid substances from any lot, and remove all

natural watercourse, creek, brook, or branch, which obstruct the water
naturally flowing therein, causing it to flow back or become stagnant, in a way
prejudicial to the health, comfort, or convenience of any of the citizens of
the neighborhood.
      (1)   If such culverts or drains are of insufficient capacity, the City
may make them of such capacity as reasonably to accommodate the flow of such
water at all times. The City Council may, by resolution, direct the owner to
fill or drain such lot, remove such putrid substance or such obstructions, and
if necessary, enlarge such culverts or covered drains to meet the requirements
thereof. After service of a copy of such resolution, or after a publication

such owner, or such owner's agent or attorney, shall comply with the directions
of the resolution within the time therein specified.

resolution, the work required thereby may be done at the expense of the
municipal corporation, and the amount of money so expended shall be recovered
from the owner before any court of competent jurisdiction. Such expense from
the time of the adoption of the resolution shall be a lien on such lot, which
may be enforced by suit in the court of common pleas, and like proceedings may
be had as directed in relation to the improvement of streets as provided in
Ohio Revised Code §715.47.
   (b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Service Director
by and through the Zoning Official or his designee determines that a citation

917.01 CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL - GENERAL POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of these Rules and Regulations is:
      (1)   To protect the public potable water supply from contamination or
pollution by isolating within the consumer's water system contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
potable water system.
      (2)   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-
connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable
water system and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or
systems containing process fluids.
      (3)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of the public and consumer's potable water systems.
   (b)   Application. The Rules and Regulations shall apply to all premises
served by the public potable water system of the City of Huron, Ohio.
   (c)   Policy. The City of Huron shall be responsible for the protection of
the public potable water system from contamination due to backflow of
contaminants through the water service connection. If, in the judgment of the
Water Superintendent, an approved backflow prevention device is necessary at
the water service connection to any consumer's premises for the safety of the
water system, the Superintendent of Water or his authorized representative
shall give notice to the consumer to install such approved backflow prevention
device at each service connection to his premises. The consumer shall
immediately install such approved device or devices at his own expense, and
failure, refusal, or inability on the part of the consumer to install such
devices immediately shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to
the premises until such device or devices have been installed.
(Ord. 1997-38. Passed 10-27-97.)
917.02 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and

and shall appear on the current list of approved backflow prevention devices of
the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
      (3)   An interchangeable connection, to be approved, shall be either a
swing type connector or a four-way valve of the lubricated plug type that
operates through a mechanism which unseats the plug, turns it ninety degrees
and reseats the plug. Four-way valves shall not be used as stop valves but must
have separate stop valves on each pipe connected to the valve. The telltale
port on the four-way valve shall have no piping connected and the threads or
flange on this port shall be destroyed so that a connection cannot be made.
   (b)   Existing backflow prevention devices approved by the Superintendent of
Water or the Director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency at the time
of installation and properly maintained shall, except for inspection, testing,
and maintenance requirements, be
excluded from the requirement of subsection (a) hereof providing the
Superintendent of Water is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the

Superintendent of Water finds a hazard to health, the device shall be replaced
by a backflow prevention device meeting the requirements of these regulations.
(Ord. 1997-38. Passed 10-27-97.)
917.09 INSTALLATION.
   (a)   Backflow prevention devices required by these rules and regulations
shall be installed at a location and in a manner approved by and at the expense
of the water consumer. In addition, any backflow prevention device required by
Section
917.07 (b) and
917.07 (c) of these regulations shall be installed at a location and in a
manner approved by the Director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency as
required by Section 6109.13 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)    Backflow prevention devices installed on the service line to a
consumer's water system shall be located on the consumer's side of the water
meter, as close to the meter as is reasonably practical, and prior to any other
connection.
   (c)   Pits or vaults shall be of water-tight construction, be so located and
constructed as to prevent flooding and shall be maintained free from standing
water by means of either a sump and pump or a suitable drain. Such sump pump or
drain shall not connect to a sanitary sewer nor permit flooding of the pit or
vault by reverse flow from its point of discharge. An access ladder and
adequate natural or artificial lighting shall be provided to permit
maintenance, inspection, and testing of the backflow prevention device.
   (d)   Reduced pressure principle backflow prevention devices must be
installed above ground level or floor level whichever is higher.
   (e)   The installation of any backflow preventer on a water service provides
a closed system and some common problems may occur following the installation.
Closed plumbing systems will not allow for thermal expansion of the water
within the plumbing. When hot water heaters become activated, water will expand
and can possibly increase the water pressure enough to activate the pressure
relief valves on hot water heaters. If this problem does occur, the customer
should be notified that for protection of the plumbing and the hot water
heater, a special ball cock may have to be installed in their toilet tank or an
expansion tank will have to be included into their plumbing system.
Installation of either device will correct the thermal expansion problem.
(Ord. 1997-38. Passed 10-27-97.)
917.10 INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   It shall be the duty of the consumer at any premises on which backflow
prevention devices required by these regulations are installed to have
inspections, test, and overhauls made in accordance with the following
schedule, or more often where inspections indicate a need:
      (1)   Air gap separations shall be inspected at the time of installation
and at least every twelve months thereafter.
      (2)   Double check valve assemblies shall be inspected and tested for
tightness at the time of installation and at least every twelve months
thereafter.

personnel certified by the Ohio Department of Health and approved by the City
of Huron as qualified to inspect, test, and overhaul backflow prevention
devices.
   (c)   Whenever backflow prevention devices required by these regulations are
found to be defective, they shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the
expense of the consumer without delay.
   (d)    The water consumer must maintain a complete record of each backflow
prevention device from purchase to retirement. This shall include a
comprehensive listing that includes a record of all tests, inspections,
repairs, and overalls. Records of inspections, tests, repairs, and overhauls
shall be submitted to the City of Huron Water Superintendent within thirty days
of completions. Annually the customer shall be notified by the Water Division
that his backflow prevention device must be retested and given a list of
certified testers. Once the device is tested, copies of the test should be
forwarded to the Water Superintendent prior to July 1 of the current year.
   (e)   Backflow prevention devices shall not be bypassed, made inoperative,
removed or otherwise made ineffective without specific authorization by the
City of Huron and/or the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.

   (b)   It shall be the duty of the water consumer to maintain the low
pressure cut-off device in proper working order and to certify to the
Superintendent of Water, at least once a year, that the device is operating
properly.
(Ord. 1997-38. Passed 10-27-97.)
917.12 SPRINKLER AND IRRIGATION SERVICES.
   (a)   All services designated as sprinkler or irrigation shall be required
to have an approved backflow prevention device installed in the sprinkler/
irrigation service line downstream from the water meter and as close to the
meter as practicable. Backflow prevention devices shall be a reduced pressure
principle device conforming to the requirements of the American Society of
Sanitary Engineers (ASSE) specification ASSE 1013 or a pressure vacuum breaker
device confirming to ASSE 1020. Responsibility for installation, maintenance,

(Ord. 2013-38. Passed 9-24-13.)
921.07 DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition of Illicit Discharges. No person shall discharge, or cause
to be discharged, an illicit discharge into the MS4. The commencement, conduct,
or continuance of any illicit discharge to the MS4 is prohibited except as
described below:
      (1)   Water line flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows;
rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration; uncontaminated
pumped ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains;
air conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; and discharges or flows from fire fighting activities. These
discharges are exempt until such time as they are determined by the City of
Huron to be significant contributors of pollutants to the MS4.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the City of Huron as being
necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Discharges from off-lot discharging household sewage treatment
systems existing prior to January 1, 2007 and permitted by the Erie County
Board of Health for the purpose of discharging treated sewage effluent in
accordance with Ohio Administrative Code 3701-29, or other applicable Erie
County Board of Health regulations, until such time as the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency issues an NPDES permitting mechanism for household sewage
treatment systems existing prior to January 1, 2007. These discharges are
exempt unless such discharges are deemed to be creating a public health
nuisance by the Erie County Board of Health. Discharges from new or replacement
off-lot household sewage treatment systems installed after January 1, 2007 are
not exempt from the requirements of this regulation.
   In compliance with the City of Huron Storm Water Management Program,
discharges from all off-lot discharging household sewage treatment systems must
either be eliminated or have coverage under an appropriate NPDES permit issued
and approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. When such permit
coverage is available for systems existing prior to January 1, 2007, discharges
from off-lot discharging household sewage treatment systems existing prior to
January 1, 2007 will no longer be exempt from the requirements of this
regulation.
   (b)   Prohibition of Illegal Connections. The construction, use,
maintenance, or continued existence of illegal connections to the MS4 is
prohibited.
      (1)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illegal
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (2)   A person is considered to be in violation of this regulation if the
person connects a line conveying illicit discharges to the MS4, or allows such
a connection to continue. (Ord. 2013-38. Passed 9-24-13.)
921.08 MONITORING OF ILLICIT DISCHARGES AND ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   Establishment of an Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection
Monitoring Program: The City of Huron shall establish a program to detect and
eliminate illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4.
   This program shall include the mapping of the MS4, including MS4 outfalls
and household sewage treatment systems; the routine inspection of storm water
outfalls to the MS4, and the systematic investigation of potential residential,
commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities for the sources of any dry
weather flows found as the result of these inspections.
   (b)   Inspection of Residential, Commercial, Industrial, or Institutional
Facilities.
      (1)   The City of Huron shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to this regulation as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this regulation.

subject to this regulation such devices as are necessary to conduct monitoring
and/or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge, as determined by the
City of Huron.

owner/operator to install monitoring equipment as necessary. This sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in safe and proper
operating condition by the facility owner/operator at the owner/operators
expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be
calibrated by the City of Huron to ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and reasonable
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed
by the facility's owner/operator at the written or oral request of the City of
Huron and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be
borne by the facility owner/operator.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the City of Huron access to a
facility subject to this regulation for the purposes of illicit discharge
inspection is a violation of this regulation.
      (6)   If the City of Huron is refused access to any part of the facility
from which storm water is discharged, and the City of Huron demonstrates
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this regulation, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of an inspection and
sampling program designed to verify compliance with this regulation or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the public health, safety, and welfare,
the City of Huron may seek issuance of a search warrant, civil remedies
including but not limited to injunctive relief, and/or criminal remedies from
any court of appropriate jurisdiction.
      (7)   Any costs associated with these inspections shall be assessed to
the facility owner/operator.
         (Ord. 2013-38. Passed 9-24-13.)
921.09 ENFORCEMENT.

   (b)   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the Notice of Violation shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said Notice shall further advise
that, should the facility owner/operator fail to remediate or restore within
the established deadline, a legal action for enforcement may be initiated.
   (c)   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation must meet compliance
standards within the time established in the Notice of Violation.
   (d)   Administrative Hearing: If the violation has not been corrected
pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Notice of Violation, the City of
Huron shall schedule an administrative hearing with the Board of Zoning Appeals
or their designee to determine reasons for non-compliance and to determine the
next enforcement activity. Notice of the administrative hearing shall be hand
delivered and/or sent registered mail.
   (e)   Injunctive Relief: It shall be unlawful for any owner/operator to
violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this
regulation pursuant to O.R.C. 3709.211. If an owner/operator has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this regulation, the City of Huron may
petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the owner/
operator from activities that would create further violations or compelling the
owner/operator to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.

923.07   Stormwater fee classification and collection.
923.01  CREATION OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FEE.
   It is hereby declared necessary for the protection of the public health,
safety, welfare and convenience of the City and its inhabitants to establish
just and equitable rates or charges to be paid to the City for the use of such
services which shall be used for the payment of the cost of stormwater
management, maintenance, operation, repair, construction, reconstruction, and
related costs associated with stormwater regulations and requirements.
(Ord. 2017-16. Passed 5-23-17.)
923.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, and unless otherwise defined, words used in
the singular shall include the plural, and the plural, the singular; words used
in the present tense shall include the future tense. The word "shall" is
mandatory and not discretionary. The word "may" is permissive. Words not
defined specifically within this Chapter shall be construed utilizing the
definitions cited within the Huron Codified Ordinances, and if not defined
therein, shall be construed to have the meaning given by common and ordinary
use as defined in the latest edition of Webster's Dictionary.
(Ord. 2017-16. Passed 5-23-17.)
923.05 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FEE.
      A quarterly service charge is imposed upon all real property in the City
to fund stormwater management programs. This service charge shall be known as
the Stormwater Management Fee. (Ord. 2017-16. Passed 5-23-17.)
923.07  STORMWATER FEE CLASSIFICATION AND COLLECTION.
   (a)   For purposes of determining the Stormwater Management Fee, all
properties in the City are classified into one of the following classes:
            (1)    Single Family Residential Property
            (2)    Multi-Family Residential Property
            (3)    Commercial and Industrial Property
      
   (b)    Single Family Residential Fee. The Council finds that the intensity
of development of most parcels of real property in the City classified as
single family residential is similar and that it would be excessively and
unnecessarily expensive to determine precisely the    square footage of the
improvements (such as buildings, structure, and other impervious    area) on
each such parcel. Therefore, all single family residential properties in the
City shall be charged a flat Stormwater Management Fee, of $5.00 (five dollars)
per quarter    equal the base rate, regardless of the size of the parcel or the
improvements.
   (c)   Multi-Family Residential Property. For the same reasons as stated in
subsection (b) the fee charged shall be $7.00 (seven dollars) per quarter.
   (d)   Commercial/Industrial Property. For the same reasons as stated in
subsection (b) the fee charged shall be $10.00 (ten dollars) per quarter.
   
   (e)   The Stormwater Fee shall be billed and collected quarterly with the
monthly City's services utility bill for those properties within the corporate
limits of the City utilizing the City utilities. The Stormwater Fee for those
properties utilizing City utilities is part of a consolidated statement for
utility customers which is generally paid by a single payment. The payments
received by the City from each consumer shall be applied first to the charge
for garbage, refuse, recyclables and yard waste, then to the charge for water
service and the balance to be applied towards the stormwater fee.

1113.01 INTENT; PROCEDURE DEPENDENT UPON IMPROVEMENTS.
   Procedures are hereby established for proposing, designing and preparing
plans for the subdivision and development of land and for reviewing and
approving same. For those subdivisions which do not involve improvements to
public utilities, streets or other open public spaces, classified as minor
subdivisions, a short procedure is established to assure integration with the
adjacent developments and compliance with Municipal codes. For those
subdivisions which involve design of streets and other public facilities and
the installation of improvements, a more extended procedure is established.
(Ord. 1961-3. Passed 7-31-61.)
1113.02 REVIEW AND APPROVAL BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   The provisions of these Regulations shall be administered by the Planning
Commission. The Commission meetings at which a subdivision application is
considered shall be open to the public, and any person attending may present
any appropriate matter thereto. The Commission, upon its own motion, or by
petition of owners of property on a preliminary plan of a subdivision, shall
hold a public hearing thereon at such time and place and upon such notice as
the Commission may designate. (Ord. 1961-3. Passed 7-31-61.)
1113.03 PREAPPLICATION ACTION.
   Before planning a subdivision or dividing a parcel of land, the developer of
land shall obtain a copy of these Subdivision Regulations, and information
showing how the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, the Thoroughfare Plan and
other plans of the City may effect the development of the property under
consideration. (Ord. 1961-3. Passed 7-31-61.)
1113.04 SUBMISSION OF SKETCH PLAN.
   Prior to subdividing or resubdividing land within the jurisdiction of these
Subdivision Regulations, the developer shall submit five prints of a sketch
plan of the proposed subdivision to the secretary of the Planning Commission
not more than seven or less than three workings days prior to a regular meeting
of the Commission, and it shall take action at such meeting. The sketch shall
be for the purpose of classification and preliminary discussion and it shall
include such information and plans as may be required by the rules of the
Planning Commission. These provisions shall not be construed to require the
preparation of a plan or plat or filing for review the conveyance of property
by a description used in conveying the same property prior to October 19, 1953.
(Ord. 1961-3. Passed 7-31-61.)
1113.045 PROPOSED LOTS WHICH DO NOT MEET ZONING REQUIREMENTS.
   If, after submission of the sketch plan of the proposed subdivision,
resubdivision or division of property, the Planning Commission determines that
one or more lots, as defined by the Zoning Ordinance, intended to be created by
such proposed subdivision, resubdivision or division, do not meet the minimum
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, the Planning Commission shall notify the
developer of such fact and thereafter shall take no further action until the
developer has secured a variance from the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance
from the Board of Building and Zoning Appeals.
   If the developer secures a variance from the Board of Building and Zoning
Appeals, the Planning Commission may thereupon proceed to consider the
application for the subdivision, resubdivision or division of the land in
accordance with the procedure hereinafter set forth.
(Ord. 1964-13. Passed 4-27-64.)
1113.05 CLASSIFICATION OF MINOR SUBDIVISION.
   If the Planning Commission determines the proposed subdivision of land:
   (a)    Adjoins an existing public street and does not involve the opening,
widening, extension or improvement of any street or the installation of any
public utility; and
   (b)    Creates not more than five lots; and
   (c)    That the original tract or all adjoining tracts of same ownership
have been completely subdivided or would not be adversely affected by the
proposed subdivision; and
   (d)    Complies with the Zoning Ordinance, and other sections of the Code;
then it shall be classified as a minor subdivision. (Ord. 1961-3. Passed 7-31-
61.)
1113.06 APPROVAL OF MINOR SUBDIVISION.
   If a proposed subdivision, classified as minor, complies with the provisions
of these Subdivision Regulations, and the sketch plan is satisfactory, it shall
be approved, and a notation to that effect shall be made thereon by the
secretary of the Planning Commission.
   The Commission shall determine if a metes and bounds description or a final
plat shall be required for recording.
   If a final plat shall be required, it shall be submitted to the secretary,
reviewed, acted upon and recorded in the same procedure as a major subdivision.
(Ord. 1961-3. Passed 7-31-61.)
1113.07 RECORDING OF MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   After approval of the sketch plan, the developer shall submit a deed by
metes and bounds or other adequate description, to the secretary of the
Planning Commission for review. If found to conform to the sketch plan, the
secretary shall so certify on the deed which shall be filed with the County
Recorder within 180 days after the return of the approved sketch plan.
(Ord. 1961-3. Passed 7-31-61.)
1113.08 APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY PLAN OF MAJOR SUBDIVISION.
   (a)    Application. If the proposed subdivision is not classified as a minor
subdivision, a notation to that effect shall be made on the sketch which shall
be returned to the developer; and he shall prepare and submit at least seven
working days prior to a regular meeting of the Planning Commission, three
copies of a preliminary plan of the subdivision, supplementary maps and data
and written application for approval.
   (b)    Other Public Agencies. When the proposed subdivision is located in an
area not served by public water supply or sanitary system, the Commission shall
transmit one copy of the maps and data accompanying the application to the
Board of Health or other agency having jurisdiction, for determination whether
methods for disposal of sewage are adequate and will not create a nuisance or
pollution of the water supply. When the proposed subdivision is located in
adjoining unincorporated area within the three-mile jurisdiction, one copy of
the maps and data accompanying the application shall be submitted to the zoning
commission of that township or the regional or county planning commission.
   (c)    Planning Commission Action. The Commission shall, within thirty days
after the meeting at which such proposal was first presented, or within such
further time as the applicant may agree to, act upon the preliminary plan. If
the Commission acts favorably, the secretary shall affix his signature to two
copies of the plan with a notation that it has received preliminary approval
and return one copy to the developer and the other copy shall be retained. If
the Commission acts unfavorably, they shall state in writing the conditions
that must be complied with before approval is given.
   (d)    Subdivision Shall Be in the Public Interest. The preliminary plan of
a subdivision shall not be approved unless:
      (1)    All the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, these Subdivision
Regulations and other codes of the City are complied with; and
      (2)    There is a need for additional subdivision of land; and
      (3)    The land is suitable for the various purposes intended; and
      (4)    The subdivision can be adequately and economically served with
public facilities and services suitable in the circumstances; and
      (5)    All land intended for building sites can be used safely and
without endangering the health of the residents by peril from floods, erosion,
continuously high water table or other menace.
   (e)    Effect of Approval of Preliminary Plan. Preliminary approval shall
confer upon the developer the following rights for a two-year period from the
date of approval:
      (1)    That the general layout, the arrangement of streets, lots and
other planned features are approved and the plan is to serve as a guide for the
preparation of the subsequent final plat of the subdivision.
      (2)    That the general terms and conditions under which the preliminary
approval was granted will not be changed.
      (3)    That such developer may submit, on or before the expiration date,
the whole or part or parts of such subdivision for final approval and
recording. (Ord. 1961-3. Passed 7-31-61.)
1113.09 APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAT OF MAJOR SUBDIVISION.
   The final plat of the subdivision shall be a comprehensive plan of the
development. It shall incorporate all modifications required by the Planning
Commission and otherwise conform to the preliminary plan as approved. The
developer may submit only that portion of an approved preliminary plan which he
proposed to develop and record at the time; provided, however, that such
portion conforms to all provisions of these Subdivision Regulations.
(Ord. 1961-3. Passed 7-31-61.)
1113.10 RECORD PLAT.
   A final plat of the proposed subdivision, showing the proposed layout of the
streets and lots, made with material approved by the County Recorder at a scale
of not less than one inch to 100 feet and properly dimensioned, shall be
submitted to the Planning Commission for their approval. Such plat shall
conform to the following requirements of the Commission:
   (a)    The subdivision shall be surveyed by a Registered Surveyor of the
State, and the boundaries shall be shown and defined by distance and bearings.
   (b)    The proposed name of the subdivision and the streets therein shall be
shown on the plat, and neither shall duplicate or closely approximate the names
of subdivisions of streets within the City, or within three miles outside the
corporate limits thereof.
   (c)    The location of the subdivision, with regard to City lots or outlots,
and the names of all adjoining property owners of record shall be shown on the
plat.
   (d)    The total acreage within the subdivision, including the lots and
dedicated streets, alleys and crosswalks, shall be shown on the plat.
   (e)    A north arrow and scale shall be shown on the plat.
   (f)    Permanently installed markers which are adequate for a resurvey shall
be shown on the plat. Each corner of each lot shall be marked with a permanent
type marker. Such markers shall be in place at the time of acceptance of the
subdivision by the City.
   (g)    The setback building line shall be shown at each lot in the
subdivision.
   (h)    City lot numbers shall be approved by the City Engineer, according to
Huron City progressive numbering system, immediately prior to the recording of
the plat.
   (i)    The plat shall have the following printed or lettered in suitable
places thereon:
          I/we, the undersigned, owners of the land embraced within the
subdivision, do hereby acknowledge this plat to be my/our free act and deed,
and dedicate the streets, crosswalkways and alleys herein shown to public use
forever. (Add waiver of dower clause, if needed.)
         (If owner is a corporation, use corporate form.)
      (Ord. 1961-3. Passed 7-31-61.)
1113.11 CONSTRUCTION OF IMPROVEMENTS OR PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES.
   The developer may install and construct all required site improvements
before applying for approval of the final plat of the subdivision; and, if the
improvements are satisfactorily completed, a certificate of completion by the
City Engineer shall accompany such application. Or, in lieu thereof, if the
developer furnishes a satisfactory performance guarantee, he may apply for
approval of the final plat of the subdivision before the site improvements are
started either by himself or by the City on an assessment program. If
improvements are partially installed, he may also furnish a performance
guarantee for the remainder of the work and apply for approval of the final
plat.
   (a)    Application for Approval. Application for approval of a final plat of
a subdivision shall be submitted in writing to the Planning Commission together
with the tracing of the final plat and three prints thereof and other required
maps and data in the form specified in Section
1113.10 . The application shall be submitted within two years after approval of
the preliminary plan; otherwise, such approval shall become null and void
unless an extension of time is granted by the Commission.
   (b)    Action by the Planning Commission and Other Municipal Officials. The
final plat shall be reviewed by the Commission and other officials for:
      (1)    Conformity with conditions of approval of the preliminary plan,
and any modifications required; and
      (2)    Correctness of mathematical data and computation; and
      (3)    Assurance that all other matters requiring review comply with
these Subdivision Regulations.
If the final plat is correct in regard to the aforesaid provisions, and if the
required site improvements have been installed, or alternatively, a
satisfactory performance guarantee has been filed, the Commission shall approve
the plat within forty-five days of submission of the final plat for approval
(or within such extension of time as agreed to by the applicant), otherwise,
the plat shall be deemed to have been approved.
   (c)    Form of Approval. The approval of the final plat shall be indicated
by a statement to that effect on the original plat with the signature of the
chairman and secretary of the Commission, and the Commission shall obtain three
copies thereof. The reason for disapproval of any final plat shall be stated in
the records of the Commission. (Ord. 1961-3. Passed 7-31-61.)
1113.12 PUBLIC LAND WITHIN SUBDIVISION.
   Where a site for a proposed park, playground, school or other public use as
shown on official plans adopted by the Planning Commission for the immediate or
future development of the City is located in whole or in part in an area
proposed to be subdivided, the Commission may require the subdivider to grant
the appropriate public agency an option to purchase or an opportunity to
acquire any such area within the proposed subdivision. Acquisition prices as
contained in the option shall not exceed the original raw land cost plus fifty
percent of the cost to install required improvements across any frontage of
such land. The option shall have a five-year term and shall be executed prior
to the time the plat is officially signed by the Planning Commission. In
consideration of the subdivider granting the above mentioned option, the City
or School Board shall pay to the subdivider an amount equal to an estimate
(prepared by the City Engineer) of the property tax on the area included in the
option over the five-year period. The City or the School Board shall also, upon
the request of the subdivider, maintain the area contained in the option for
the five-year period.
   (a)    Acceptance of Public Land by Legislative Authority. If the final plat
includes land to be dedicated to public use, the plat shall, before it is
recorded, be submitted to Council for acceptance of such land.
      (Ord. 1961-3. Passed 7-31-61.)
1113.13 RECORDING OF APPROVED FINAL PLAT.
   (a)    Recording. The developer shall file the approved final plat in the
office of the Erie County Recorder. The approval of the Commission shall expire
within sixty days unless within that period such final plat has been duly filed
and recorded and the Commission so notified. If the final plat is revised in
any manner after approval, the approval shall be null and void.
   (b)    Effect of Recording. Recording of the final plat after approval by
the Commission shall have the effect of permitting the transfer of ownership,
offer for sale, sale or lease of any lot so recorded and of reserving or
offering for transfer to the City all streets, parks and other public areas
shown thereon but not dedicated.
   (c)    Land Designated for Public Use. A building permit affecting land that
has been designated for public use; (but not dedicated may be withheld for a
period of 180 days) or for a longer period as may be agreed to to allow the
City to acquire such land.
(Ord. 1961-3. Passed 7-31-61.)

for subdividing and other applicable codes.
   (b)    The developer prepares a sketch plan and submits same to the
Commission.
   (c)    The Commission reviews the above, and if they find it is a "minor"
subdivision they may give final approval, and the deed or final plat may be
recorded and the lots created may be sold.
   (d)    However, if the Commission classifies the sketch plan as a "major"
subdivision, then the developer shall prepare a preliminary plan in accordance
with Section
1113.08, and apply for approval.
   (e)    The Commission reviews the preliminary plan and may approve same.
   (f)    The developer, having received approval of a preliminary plan of a

      (Ord. 1961-3. Passed 7-31-61.)
1115.03 STORM WATER DRAINAGE STANDARDS.
   The development of all new and modified drainage systems shall be governed
by the guidelines set forth in this section as follows:
   (a)   Preliminary Drainage Plan. A preliminary drainage plan for all
subdivisions shall be submitted (in triplicate) to the City for review and
approval. It shall include a drawing showing the general runoff pattern of the
area, which is to be improved, as well as the runoff patterns of adjacent areas
which may affect or be affected by the proposed improvement. A copy of the
preliminary plat which is required by the Planning Commission may serve as the
preliminary drainage plan providing sufficient data has been supplied to check
the feasibility of the drainage system as proposed by the developer.
   (b)   Adequate Drainage Outlet. Surface water runoff from a development
shall be drained through an adequate outlet. The location of the outlet shall
be approved by the City. The outlet may be a ditch, stream, storm sewer or
approved retention basin, which has sufficient capacity to accommodate the
runoff in a reasonable manner.
   (c)   Drainage Easement. Easements of adequate width shall be required for
all existing and proposed drainage courses that are not within the road right
of way. The development's owner shall be responsible for obtaining any
easements required outside the subdivision boundaries, and have them properly
recorded in the Erie County Recorder's Office.
         All drainage easements shall be shown on the plat and construction
drawings along with their intended purpose specified in writing.
   (d)   Right of Way for Drainage Structures. When a drainage structure
extends beyond the limits of the normal road right of way, additional right of
way shall be provided around the structure to allow for adequate maintenance.
   (e)   Final Drainage Plan.. The final drainage plan shall include drawings
of the entire drainage system and be submitted to the City (in triplicate) for
review and approval. The plan shall conform to the guidelines herein and to any
special requirements of the Planning Commission in approving the preliminary
plat. The plan shall also include the engineering calculations used in
determining the design of the drainage courses, drainage structures and
stormwater runoff control structures.
         All drainage construction drawings shall be sealed with the stamp of a
professional engineer. The drainage drawings must be approved by the City prior
to the construction of any portion of the drainage system.
         Minimum requirements for drawings and engineering calculations for
drainage systems shall comply with all aspects of Section
1117.01 (Construction Plan; Profile; Cross Sections) of the Codified Ordinances
of the City and also the following:
      (1)   A map showing the existing topography of the development area and
adjacent land within 200 feet of its boundary. The topographic map shall use a
contour interval appropriate to portray clearly the surface conformation and
drainage pattern of the area.
      (2)   A vicinity map at a scale of not less than 2000 feet to the inch
showing the development area in relation to existing road and nearest existing
thoroughfares, streams and water areas.
      (3)   The drainage area for each pipe or drainage structure shall be
outlined and have the acreage shown. To show the entire drainage area,
additional sheets may be required. If additional sheets are needed, existing
aerial mapping or USGS mapping will be sufficient.
      (4)   The acreage of all tributary drainage areas and their sum.
      (5)   Times of concentration, intensity and runoff coefficients used in
the Rational Method to estimate the amount of runoff.
            Overland slopes, curve numbers, hydraulic lengths, etc., used in
the SCS Peak Discharge Method.
            For methods other than those above, enough information must be
provided to the City to allow for an accurate review.
      (6)   Discharge in cubic feet per second (cfs), velocities in feet per
second (fps), and any additional data needed to establish that the drainage
system will convey the flow.
      (7)   The plan and profile of all drainage courses.
      (8)   Cross sections along the drainage course at 100 foot intervals or
as directed by the City.
      (9)   Size and types of all drainage improvements including the detailed
standard drawings of each.
   (f)   Computation of Stormwater Runoff. Given the type of drainage structure
to be designed, the rate of runoff shall be computed using the storm
frequencies given below:
 
Structure    Storm Frequency (years)
Storm sewer  5
Open ditches 10
Culverts     25
 
      The design frequency to be considered for an individual structure may be
altered by the City where the health and safety of the residents would be
endangered by the hazards of flood waters or increased flows.
   (g)   Design Frequency. To prevent damages caused by accelerated stormwater
runoff from developing areas, the increased peak rates and volumes of runoff
shall be controlled such that:
      (1)   The peak rate of runoff from a Critical Storm and all more frequent
storms occurring on the development area does not exceed the peak rate of
runoff from a two year frequency storm (of 24 hour duration) over the same area
under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence than the critical storm, up to
the 100 year storm, have peak runoff rates no greater than peak runoff rates
from equivalent size storms under pre-development conditions.
      The critical storm for a specific development area is determined as
follows:
      (1)   Determine by appropriate hydrologic methods the total volume of
runoff from a two year frequency, 24 hour storm occurring over the development
area before and after development.
      (2)   From the volumes determined in (1), determine the percentage
increase in volume of runoff due to development, and using this percentage,
select the 24 hour critical storm from the following table:
% Increase in Volume of Runoff “Critical Storm”
                               Discharge Limitation
(at least)  (but less than)    (year)

0           20                 3
20          50                 5
50          100                10
100         250                25
250         500                50
500 or more                    100
      (3)   Storage volume does not have to be provided for runoff from off-
site upstream areas. Upstream runoff should be conveyed through the site in
accordance with the current runoff conditions.
      (4)   The requirements of this section for runoff rates and volumes shall
be satisfied at each location where runoff leaves the development area.
   (h)   Storm Sewers. All storm sewer installations shall comply with PART
ELEVEN, TITLE ONE of the Codified Ordinances of the City in addition to the
following:
      (1)   Drainage easements shall be a minimum width of twenty feet when
located outside the road right of way. This easement shall be shown on both the
final plat and the construction drawings and labeled "Storm Sewer Easement".
      (2)   All storm sewers installed in the right of way shall be provided
with curb inlets.
      (3)   The hydraulics of the storm sewer should be arrived at by the use
of Manning's Equation:
V =    1.49 R (2/3) S (1/2) also Q = AV
    n
Where:   V   =   velocity (fps)
   N   =   Manning's roughness coefficient
   R   =   hydraulic radius
   S   =   slope
   Q   =   flow (cfs)
   A   =   area (sf)
         Kutter's formula may also be used in the hydraulic computation of
storm sewers.
      (4)   All storm sewers shall be designed with hydraulic slopes sufficient
to provide a mean velocity, when flowing full, of not less than three feet per
second. Where the velocity exceeds fifteen feet per second, special provisions
must be made to protect against erosion and displacement.
      (5)   All storm sewers shall be properly sized but, in no case, shall a
storm sewer be less than twelve inches in diameter.
         A.   All storm sewers shall be sized to flow approximately full for a
five year frequency storm. The size shall be determined by working downstream
from the inlet of the first sewer run.
         B.   Hydraulic gradient for flood flow (ten year) should be kept below
catch basin grates. This will eliminate storm water being detained on the
pavement surface during this period.
      (6)   When storm sewers are increased in size in the direction of flow,
the invert of the larger pipe shall be lowered to maintain the same energy
gradient (place the crowns of both pipes at the same elevations). A larger pipe
shall not discharge into a smaller pipe unless specifically approved by the
City.
   (i)   Construction Specifications. All drainage structures and appurtenances
shall comply with applicable City specifications and/or the most current
edition of ODOT's Construction and Materials Specifications.
      (Ord. 1994-2. Passed 3-14-94.)

1117.13 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE BOND.
   Prior to approval by the Planning Commission of the final plat, the owner of
the subdivision shall give to the City a full construction and maintenance
performance bond in the amount of the estimated cost of the grading, storm
sewers, sanitary sewers, water lines, paving, walks, corner markers and
incidentals necessary to complete the construction of the project. The bond
shall be executed by the owner with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the
Finance Director and the Law Director, guaranteeing the completion of the
installation of the improvements within such time as is proposed by the owner,
recommended by the City Manager and approved by Council. Such period of time
shall extend from the date of the approval of the bond.
   Upon completion of the various items of work, and the acceptance of same by
the City, the owner may apply to the City for final inspection. If the City
finds that all installations meet the requirements of the approved plans and
specifications, the amount of the bond may be reduced to ten percent of the
original amount, guaranteeing against defective workmanship or material
incorporation in the project, or any displacement of or damage to the pavement,
walks or other improvements during the twelve-month maintenance period.
   At the termination of such twelve-month maintenance period the owner may
apply to the City for an inspection of the various items or work. Before such
inspection is made, the owner shall cause the sanitary sewers, storm sewers and
the surface of the pavement and walk to be cleaned. When the City finds that
any defects in workmanship or materials which might have developed within the
twelve-month maintenance period have been properly corrected, they shall notify
the owner that the bond may be released, and the City shall assume all
maintenance thereafter.
   If the improvements are not completed as proposed within the time limit that
was established, the bond shall be forfeited and the money shall be collected
by the City and used to complete the specified improvements. The money that is
collected from the bond shall be used for no other purpose, and any money
remaining after the completion of the work shall be returned to the original
depositor.
(Ord. 1961-3. Passed 7-31-61.)
1117.14 INSURANCE.
   The owner shall save the City, its officers and agents harmless from all
claims of any nature whatsoever by any person, either for damages to person or
to property, arising out of the carrying out of the work and/or from liability
from all claims relating to labor or material furnished for the entire work and
material used in constructing the improvements. The owner shall prior to
acceptance of the plat, furnish the City with evidence of paid-up insurance for
the protection of himself and the City, that provides public liability
insurance and automobile insurance in the following minimum amounts and
coverages:
 
Bodily injury-    each person     $200,000
Bodily injury -   each occurrence 500,000
Property damage - each accident   100,000
Property damage - aggregate       200,000
(Ord. 1961-3. Passed 7-31-61.)
1117.15 STREET LIGHTING.
   The owner shall be responsible for the installation of street lights at each
intersection within the subdivision and at intervals between each intersection
of 200 to 250 feet if Cobra head lamps are used, and at intervals between each
intersection of 150 to 200 feet if Colonial Post top lamps are used.
   The type and size of Cobra head lamps and Colonial Post Top lamps to be
installed by owner shall be subject to the approval of the City to assure that
sufficient luminance will be provided as specified by the Illuminating
Engineering Society of North America for the lighting of residential streets
and roads. (Ord. 1990-2. Passed 1-22-90.)

89.)
1119.021 SOIL ANALYSIS FOR PAVEMENT DESIGN.
   (a)   Prior to the design and submission of the construction plans and
profiles, the developer or his representative shall retain a reputable soil
testing laboratory to make soil borings beneath the pavement of the proposed
project. The spacing of the borings shall be at intervals of approximately 500
feet along the pavement center line. Every project shall have a minimum of two
borings. The depth of the borings shall be made to a minimum depth of four feet
below the proposed pavement center line grade. The following tests shall be
made on each soil stratum encountered below the proposed grade line of the
pavement:
      (l)    Natural moisture content;
      (2)    Mechanical analysis (sieving and hydrometer);
      (3)    Atterberg's Limits and Group Index;
      (4)    Modified Proctor Tests in C.B.R. mold (set of three moisture
density relationships);
      (5)    California Bearing Ratio in C.B.R. mold (set of three);
      (6)    Standard Proctor Tests.
   The tests must be made in accordance with the current procedures of the
American Society for Testing Materials.
   (b)    After the report has been received from the soils testing laboratory,
the pavement shall be designed as follows:
      (l)    Maximum gross loading on Municipal streets, excluding truck routes
or State routes, is five tons.
      (2)    The distribution of gross loading shall be twenty percent to front
axle and eighty percent to rear axle. Pavement shall be designed for a maximum
axle loading of 8,000 pounds. (Loads adopted from A.A.S.H.O. Specifications for
Highway Bridges, 1957.)
   (c)    The submission of construction plans and profiles by the developer or
his representative to the City shall include three copies of the soil
laboratory report.
   (d)    Sufficient Standard Proctor Tests shall be made during construction
to determine the condition of the subgrade. The tests shall be performed by the
same laboratory as used during the original testing.
   (e)    The costs of all soil testing shall be at the expense of the
developer or benefiting owners. (Ord. 1966-3. Passed 5-9-66.)
1119.03 ASPHALTIC CONCRETE PAVEMENT.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Former Section
1119.03 was repealed by Ordinance 1989-10, passed April 24, 1989.)
1119.04 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENT WITH INTEGRAL PAVEMENT.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Former Section
1119.04 was repealed by Ordinance 1989-10, passed April 24, 1989.)
1119.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SANITARY SEWERS.
   (a)    Testing. The owner or developer shall have all pipe inspected and
tested by an independent testing laboratory at the point of manufacture. Prior
to construction such owner or developer shall furnish to the City a copy of
such report. No uninspected or rejected pipe shall be delivered to the job
site.
   (b)    Quality of Pipe. All vitrified pipe shall be of the best quality,
salt-glazed, vitrified stoneware, of the hub and spigot pattern, and of sizes
and dimensions shown or specified. Thorough vitrification through the body of
the pipe and thorough salt-glazing on both the inside and the outside surfaces
shall be required.
   No old pipe that has been previously used shall be allowed in the work
specified herein.
   All vitrified pipe shall be produced by a recognized manufacturer who has
been producing pipe as specified continuously for not less than five years.
   (c)    Dimensions of Pipe. The sizes of vitrified pipe mentioned herein or
shown on the drawings refer to nominal inside diameters. ASTM Designation C-700
pipe may be either full diameter or reduced diameter pipe, but all pipe
furnished must be of the same dimensions. Straight pipe shall be furnished in
minimum lengths of three feet.
   No pipe shall be used which, designed to be straight, varies from a straight
line more than three-eighths of an inch in a three-foot length.
   (d)    Pipe Strength and Loading. No pipe shall be loaded beyond the minimum
crushing strength determined by the Three Edge Bearing Method and as tabulated
for the various sizes in the respective Specifications, despite the fact that
sand bedding shall be strictly required.
   Applied trench loadings shall be as computed by the Marston formula and may
be taken from the tables of "Loads on Vitrified Clay Pipe in Pounds per Lineal
Foot Caused by Backfilling with Various Materials", pages 77 to 90, inclusive,
of the Clay Pipe Engineering Manual, as published in 1962 by The Clay Sewer
Pipe Association, Inc., Columbus 15, Ohio, but with due allowance for
additional live loads or surcharge and for the weight of backfill material
being used.
   ASTM Designated C-700 pipe shall be used unless otherwise directed by the
City Engineer.
   (e)    Laying. No pipe shall be laid until the trench has been properly
excavated, as specified, below the bottom of the pipe and bottom brought back
with No. 8 limestone properly compacted to grade and shaped to provide a firm
but slightly yielding trough for embedding the pipe. The practice of tamping
dirt under the end of pipe to bring it to grade shall not be tolerated. Any
defects due to settlement shall be made good by the owner at his own expense.
Bell holes shall be properly located and dug for each joint as small as
possible but large enough to properly joint the pipe, and all pipe must have
full bearing in the cradle for the full length of the pipe barrel.
   Pipe shall be thoroughly cleaned before they are laid and kept clean until
completed, with particular care that spigots and bells are free of all mud,
clay, grease, oil or other foreign substances and that they are sound,
undamaged and dry when joints are made. Before lowering into the trench, each
pipe and fitting shall be checked for soundness. Pipe shall be carefully
handled and lowered into the trench. No pipe shall be laid without the presence
of the City Inspector.
   All trenches shall be kept free of water when pipe laying is in progress and
no water shall be allowed to rise to the bottom of the pipe until all joint
material has received its initial set.
   All pipes and specials shall be laid accurately to the required lines and
grades and shall be uniformly supported along their entire length. Spigots
shall be forced into sockets as far as possible. Special care shall be taken to
insure that each length shall abut against the next in such manner that there
shall be no shoulder or unevenness along the inside bottom half of the pipe and
so that alignment and slope are correct. No pipe shall be brought into position
until the preceding length has been thoroughly embedded and secured in place.
   The upper end of all uncompleted pipe lines shall be provided with a
temporary stopper carefully fitted so as to keep dirt and other substances from
entering. This stopper shall be kept in the end of the pipe line at all times
when laying is not in actual progress so as to keep the pipe free at all times
of internal obstructions. When pipe or specials are left for future extension
or for house connections the bell shall be closed by a clay or concrete stopper
properly and securely cemented into place. The use of brick, wood or other
substances shall not be accepted as stoppers.
   Whenever a pipe requires cutting to fit the line or to bring it to the
required location, the work shall be done in a satisfactory manner so as to
leave a smooth end.
   Where concrete cradle is called for or is ordered to be used, the pipe shall
be laid on concrete saddles so constructed as to provide both vertical and
lateral support. The concrete cradle shall be poured after the joints have been
made, care being taken to prevent movement of the pipe.
   The supporting of pipe on wooden blocks, planks, slabs, piers, loose brick,
stones, concrete or other such supports shall not be permitted except as
specified.
   Pipes which enter or pass through concrete walls, manholes or other sections
shall be properly trimmed and finished off, flush with walls, etc., and caulked
and sealed or grouted into place to form a watertight, neatly finished surface
and joint.
   In case of pipe laying in rock, the bed shall be properly prepared. The
sides and bottom of the pipe shall be supported by compacting sand into place
so as to insure an even bearing of the pipe but so as not to disturb the pipe
joint or to throw the pipe out of alignment. Particular care shall be taken
that no part of the pipe rests upon or against rock.
   After the pipe has been properly embedded and joints made, sand shall be
carefully tamped under each side and to the spring line between the wall of the
excavation and the pipe, after which selected material shall be placed and
compacted to two feet over the top of the pipe before further backfilling is
done.
   Care shall be taken to secure watertightness and to prevent damage to or
disturbing of the joints during backfilling or at any other time after the
pipes have been laid and the joints have been made.
   There shall be no walking on or working over pipe except as may be necessary
in tamping until there is a covering of at least two feet in depth of compacted
backfill over the top of the pipe.
   Sewer pipe, except as herein modified, shall be laid in accordance with the
latest "Recommended Practice for Laying Sewer Pipe" of the American Society for
Testing Materials, Serial Designation C12, and such provision shall apply as
though herein repeated. Laying of vitrified pipe shall be further guided by the
recommendations of The Clay Sewer Pipe Association, as embodied in their
bulletin entitled "Clay Pipe Engineering Manual", published in 1962.
   (f)    Vitrified Pipe Joints. Vitrified pipe joints shall be premium joints
of either a neoprene gasket type or a preformed plastic collar or O-ring type,
as specified below, all meeting Standard Specifications C-425. Portland cement,
bituminous or asphalt joints shall not be acceptable for vitrified pipe joints
under this regulation. The owner shall submit for the approval of the City
samples, specifications and manufacturer's recommendations for making the joint
he proposes to use and no joint shall be made until approval has been given by
the City.
   The type of joint used must be the product of a reputable manufacturer whose
product has a history of satisfactory results in minimizing infiltration,
preventing the entry of roots and in resistance to disintegration, cracking or
breaking. The manufacturer's recommendations shall be followed implicitly in
preparing the pipe and making the joints.
   (g)    Plastic Collar or O-Ring Type Joint. The plastic collar joint for use
in this contract shall be made with a factory applied, tapered collar on bell
and spigot of the pipe or a collar on the spigot end of the pipe with an
annular space designed to provide predictable dimensions for an O-ring when it
is compressed, made in steel molds of a polyvinyl chloride plasticized resin.
The formulation of the material shall be such as to produce a permanently
elastic collar, placed in compression when the pipes are joined, capable of
remaining sealed with normal pipe deflections and permanently resistant to
acids and alkalis normally found in sewage. Casting of the collars shall be
such as to insure concentric rings and proper alignment of adjoining pipes when
jointed. Any evidence of excessive heat having been used in setting the plastic
collars, resulting in hardness or brittleness of the surface, shall be cause
for rejection of that pipe.
   When the pipes are ready for jointing, the collars of bell and spigot and O-
ring, if used, shall be scrupulously cleaned of all dirt or foreign material,
coated with the manufacturer's approved lubricant and the pipes shoved home.
Great care shall be exercised after laying to prevent deflection or separation
of the joint just made; all joints shall be made in the trench; only one joint
shall be made at a time.
   The O-ring gaskets, if used, shall be manufactured of natural rubber,
neoprene PVC or other approved elastomeric material. The collars and gasket
shall be manufactured in accordance with Specifications C-425.
   Pipe shall be carefully transported, stored and handled to prevent damage to
the joint collars, and any damaged or loose collars shall be cause for
rejection of the pipe.
   When the joint is completed, the sewer shall have a smooth, unobstructed
invert, and pipe shall be true to grade and alignment. Any misshapen pipe, the
invert of which protrudes above the invert of the adjacent pipe, shall be
removed and replaced.
   The plastic collar or O-ring type joint to be used shall be equal in all
respects to the Amvit Joint as manufactured by the American Vitrified Products
Company, or the Wedge-Lock or Wedge-Lock Type "O" Joint as manufactured by the
Robinson Clay Products Company.
   (h)    Neoprene Gasket Joint. As an alternate to the plastic collar joint
specified above, a neoprene gasket joint may be used. The neoprene gasket shall
be of the multi-ring seal compression type, equal in all respects to the Tylox
Type "N" Joint as manufactured by the Hamilton Kent Manufacturing Company,
especially designed for use with vitrified clay sewer pipe. The pipe to be used
shall be selected for use with the joint and the outside diameter of the spigot
ends shall not vary from the prescribed dimension by more than one-sixteenth of
an inch at any point. If necessary to ensure concentricity and proper joint
dimensions, the pipe spigots shall be furnished with collars of an approved
type.
   The neoprene gaskets shall be factory cemented in the pipe bells at the
point of manufacture. Field application of the gaskets shall not be permitted,
except in case of replacement of a damaged gasket or for special closure
pieces. When field application is permitted, it shall be performed strictly in
accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer.
   When pipe is ready for laying, the joint surfaces shall be scrupulously
cleaned of all dirt and foreign material. The gasket shall then be swabbed with
the lubricant approved for use by the gasket manufacturer and in accordance
with his recommendations. The pipe shall immediately be shoved home, with care
to ensure a tight seat and proper alignment. Great care shall be exercised
after laying to prevent deflection or separation of the joint just made; all
joints shall be made in the trench; only one joint shall be made at a time.
   Pipe shall be carefully transported, stored and handled to prevent damage to
the joint gasket, and any damaged or loose gaskets shall be cause for rejection
of the pipe.
   When the joint is completed the sewer shall have a smooth, unobstructed
invert, and pipe shall be true to grade and alignment. Any misshapen or
improperly jointed pipe, the invert of which protrudes above the invert of the
adjacent pipe, shall be removed and replaced.
   (i)    Laying Pipe in Freezing Weather. No pipe shall be laid upon a
foundation in which frost exists, nor at any time when the City deems that
there is danger of the formation of ice or the penetration of frost at the
bottom of the excavation.
   (j)    Line and Grade. Line and grade stakes shall be accurately set at
either twenty-five or fifty-foot centers, but not to exceed fifty feet, and
offset from the trench center line so as not to be disturbed during
construction. Grade bars shall be set accurately level, from the line and grade
stakes and notches or nails set for line. Not less than three adjacent grade
bars shall be used when laying pipe and grade string shall be accurate and
taut. The grade rod shall be substantially and accurately constructed and shall
be frequently checked. The grade rod shall carry both vertical and horizontal
levels.
   (k)    House Connections. In general and as called for on the drawings, as
required or as ordered, provision shall be made in the sewers for house
connections by inserting a tilted-up "Y" branch for each house connection with
a six-inch branch, in the sewer at location shown, and properly stoppered and
marked, for sewers to ten feet in depth. For sewers exceeding ten feet in
depth, the owner shall insert a "T" branch with the branch vertical, and
sufficient riser pipe topped by a "Y" branch, in such manner that the top of
the "Y" branch shall be not less than seven feet below grade or at such
elevation as to properly receive the house connection with full regard to
elevation of house sewer and slope from house to the sewer, which shall be not
less than one percent. When house services are so located that those on
opposite sides of the street come to the same point in the sewer, the owner
shall install a "T" with an eight-inch vertical branch, provide an eight-inch
riser and an eight-inch double branch "Y" with six-inch branches unless
otherwise called for. Risers are to be encased in concrete.
   The location of house connections is shown in a general way on the contract
drawings, but the exact number and location shall be determined by the City at
the time of construction of the sewer. The City may also increase the number of
connections or delete some connections as the sewer is being built, or increase
the size of connections when it deems such advisable. Concrete for encasement
of risers and of supporting pipe shall be placed in a manner to preserve
alignment and avoid disturbance of joints.
   Each stub or riser for a future house connection shall be marked as to
location by a two- inch by two-inch timber and placed with its top twelve
inches below finished road on ground surface.
   (l)   Protection of Sewer. After the sewer is completed and trench
backfilled, the owner shall maintain barricades and keep traffic off freshly
backfilled trenches until the backfill has consolidated, but in no event shall
traffic be permitted on backfill less than seventy-two hours after the trench
has been properly backfilled and compacted.
   (m)    Inspection Before Acceptance. In addition to being inspected by the
City during construction, each section of sewer between each pair of manholes
shall be inspected as soon after completion as possible and again before final
acceptance by the City. Such inspections shall be visual by looking through the
sewer from manhole to manhole with the aid of reflected sunlight or by the use
of powerful electric torch. The pipe shall be true to both line and grade, and
shall show no leaks; hydraulics of the sewer shall be in no way impaired; there
shall be no projections of connecting pipe into the sewer; sewer shall be free
from cracks, broken bells and protruding joint materials, and shall contain no
deposits of sand, dirt or other materials which will in any way reduce the full
cross sectional area. All wall joints in manholes, junction chambers, pumping
stations and elsewhere shall be tight. All finished work shall be neat in
appearance and of first class workmanship, and all details shall conform to
contract, detail, shop or working drawings from which no deviation shall be
permitted without written authority from the City. Proper stoppers and
bulkheads must be in place where required.
   If, as the result of any inspection before final acceptance of the work, it
is found that any section of any sewer has unduly settled, that joints have
opened up or when the jointing material has come loose and projects into the
sewer or if pipes or bells are found cracked, broken or misshaped beyond
accepted standards, or if any other defects are found in the sewers or in any
of their appurtenances which might impair the satisfactory performance of the
sewer or which show nonconformance with the drawings or specifications, the
owner shall cause such defective or inferior work to be promptly removed and
replaced or satisfactorily repaired by proper material and workmanship without
extra compensation for the labor, equipment and materials required.
   (n)    Test for Exfiltration or Leakage. As sewers are completed and prior
to the final acceptance of the work, sewers inclusive of appurtenances shall be
tested for exfiltration or leakage. At least one test shall be made but the
section to be tested and the manner of test shall be determined by the City.
   Each test shall be conducted on a section of sewer between two successive
manholes as selected by the City. Should any test show exfiltration or leakage
in excess of that specified herein, the City Manager may require additional
tests until satisfactory results are proved and prior to the institution of any
corrective measures, at no cost to the City.
   The test procedure shall consist of bulkheading off the manholes at each end
of the test section, then filling the sewer with clean water to a depth of two
feet over the inside top of the sewer pipe measured at the upper manhole or to
two feet above the ground water line, whichever is the higher. The water level
shall be maintained for not less than four hours by adding accurately measured
amounts of water and the exfiltration or leakage shall be determined from the
amount of water required to be added. No test shall be conducted without the
presence of an inspector. Tests shall be made only on a sewer which is
sufficiently backfilled or safeguarded otherwise against floatation.
Measurements appropriate to test shall be made by the City. Test procedure may
be altered by the City if such changes might be desirable in order to assure
reliable and accurate data.
   The owner shall furnish all labor and material required for making the
tests, inclusive of bulkheads, hose lines and inclusive as well of water from
the fire hydrants, where such are available, otherwise by such means as may be
available, all at the owner's expense.
   The maximum exfiltration and/or leakage permitted under test shall be at the
rate of 300 gallons per inch internal diameter of sewer per mile of sewer line
per twenty-four hours and, inclusive of all appurtenances within the section
such as manholes, etc., but the length of sewer used in the computation shall
be the horizontal distance between manhole center lines of the section being
tested.
   If the specified rate of exfiltration or leakage is exceeded on test, the
owner shall locate the points of excessive leakage and he shall institute
appropriate measures of correction, whereupon the length of sewer shall be
retested and this procedure continued until test requirements are met. Should
any test sections show leakage or excessive exfiltration, the City Manager may
order other sections of the same sewer tested at the owner's expense, in order
to determine that all of the sewer will meet the limitations set. Such tests
required because of excessive exfiltration or leakage shall be in addition to
the number called for in the first paragraph of this section.
   Following completion of tests in any section of sewer the owner shall remove
all bulkheads, weirs and any other obstructions, and he shall free the sewer of
water.
(Ord. 1966-44. Passed 9-26-66.)
1119.06 CONSTRUCTION OF STORM WATER SEWERS.
   All operations in connection with excavations necessary for the laying of
the sewer pipe and the disposal of all excavated material shall be made in
accordance with requirements of the City Engineer, and in accordance with Item
603 and 604 of the Standard Specifications of the State of Ohio, Department of
Transportation, latest edition.
   All trenches, unless otherwise directed by the Engineer, shall be excavated
to the depth shown on the profiles and shall be of sufficient width at both top
and bottom so as to permit the proper laying of the sewer pipe, and also the
sheeting and shoring of the trench, when necessary.
   Except as otherwise provided, all trenches and any cavities caused by the
owners' operations outside of the prescribed limits of the trenches, shall be
backfilled, as soon as practicable after the pipe has been laid, with suitable
material which has been excavated from the site and which shall be selected for
the purpose.
   The earth backfill shall be placed in horizontal layers not over eight
inches in thickness and each layer shall be thoroughly tamped. Under favorable
conditions, when allowed by the City Engineer, the earth backfill may be placed
in the trench without being tamped in horizontal layers but the trench shall be
flooded with water and "puddled" so that a suitable settlement of the backfill
materials may be obtained. The upper eighteen inches of the trench shall be
backfilled with No. 6 or No. 7 limestone properly compacted, unless otherwise
directed by the City Engineer.
   Backfilling shall not be made in freezing weather except by permission of
the Engineer, nor shall it be made with frozen materials, nor when the material
already in the trench is frozen. All materials used for backfilling shall be
free from perishable and objectionable substances, and shall contain no stones
larger than three inches in diameter.

1121.05 DISTRICTS AND BOUNDARIES.
   (a)   Districts. For the purpose of this Zoning Ordinance, the City is
hereby divided into nine categories of zoning districts. Such nine districts
are designated as follows:
      (1)   Resident Districts.
         R-1 One-Family Residence District
         R-1-A One Family Residence District
         R-2 One and Two-Family Residence District
         R-3 Multi-Family Residence District
      (2)   Nonresident Districts.
         B-1 Neighborhood Business District
         B-2 Downtown Business District
         B-3 General Business District
         I-1 Light Industrial District
         I-2 General Industrial District
         M Marina District.
   (b)   Districts and Boundaries Established. The several districts and
boundaries thereof shall be and the same are hereby adopted and established as
shown on the Zoning Map of the City, which Map, together with all notation,
references, data, district boundaries and other information shown thereon,
shall be and is hereby made a part of this Ordinance and is appended hereto. A
copy of the Zoning Map, properly attested, shall also be and remain on file in
the office of the City Clerk.
   (c)   District Boundaries. Except where referenced on the Map to a street or
alley line or other designated line by dimensions shown on such Map, the
district boundary lines follow lot lines or the centerlines of streets or
alleys as they existed at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance. Where no
such reference lines exist and a district boundary is neither finitely
determined in the text of this Ordinance, nor by specific notation of a
dimension on the Zoning Map, the location of the boundary shall be determined
by scaled dimension on the Zoning Map as verified by the Board of Building and
Zoning Appeals.
   (d)   Lot Divided; Extension of District. Where a district boundary line
established in this section or as shown on the Zoning Map divides a lot which
was in single ownership at the time of enactment of this Ordinance, the use
authorized thereon and the other district requirements applying to the least
restricted portion of such lot under this Ordinance shall be considered as
extending to the entire lot, provided the more restricted portion of such lot
is entirely within twenty-five feet of the dividing district boundary line. The
use so extended shall be deemed to be conforming.
   (e)   Uncertainty as to Boundaries; Interpretation. All questions concerning
the exact location of district boundary lines shall be determined by the Board
of Building and Zoning Appeals according to rules and regulations which may be
adopted by it.
   (f)   Vacated Street or Alley. Whenever any street, alley or other public
way is vacated by official action as provided by law, the zoning district
adjoining the side of such public way shall be extended automatically,
depending on the side or sides to which such lands revert, to include the right
of way thus vacated, which shall thenceforth be subject to all regulations of
the extended district or districts.
   (g)   Property Not Included; Annexation. In every case where property has
not been specifically included within a district, the same is hereby declared
to be in the R-1 District. Territory annexed to or consolidated with the City
subsequent to the effective date of this section shall, upon the effective date
of such annexation or consolidation, become a part of the R-1 District. Such
districting shall be temporary and the Planning Commission shall recommend to
Council within a period of not to exceed six months from such date of
annexation or consolidation a final zoning map for the annexed territory that
is consistent with the development policies established in the Policies Plan.

extended, enlarged or altered except in conformity with the regulations herein
specified for the district in which is it located; such regulations including,
but without limitation, the following: the use of buildings, structures or
land, including performance standards for the control of any "dangerous and
objectionable elements", as defined herein, in connection with such use; the
height, size and dimensions of buildings or structures; the size or dimensions
of lots, yards and other open spaces surrounding buildings; the provision,
location, size, improvement and operation of off-street parking, loading and
unloading spaces.
   (b)   Additional Uses. Uses other than those specifically mentioned in this
Zoning Ordinance as permitted or prohibited uses in each of the districts also
may be allowed or not allowed therein, as the case may be, upon referral by the
Board, of any such use in question, to Council, and provided if, in the
judgment of Council, such other uses are of similar character to those
mentioned and will have no adverse influence or no more adverse influence on
adjacent properties or the neighborhood or the community than the permitted
uses specifically mentioned for the district; or such other uses are similar in
character to those specifically prohibited in that they would have similar or
more serious adverse influence on adjacent properties or the neighborhood or
the community than the uses specifically mentioned as prohibited in the
district.
   (c)   Conversion of Dwellings. The conversion of any building into a
dwelling or the conversion of any dwelling so as to accommodate an increased
number of dwelling units or families shall be permitted only within a district
in which a new building for similar occupancy would be permitted under this
Ordinance, and only when the resulting occupancy will comply with the
requirements governing new construction in such district, with respect to
minimum lot size, lot area per dwelling unit, percentage of lot coverage,
dimensions of yards and other open spaces and off-street parking. Each
conversion shall be subject also to such further requirements as may be
specified hereinafter within the section applying to such district. The
aforesaid requirements with respect to lot coverage, yards and other open
spaces shall not apply in case the conversion will not involve major exterior
structural changes and:
      (1)   There is either a shortage of not more than ten percent (10%) in
the required dimensions or area of each of not more than two such requirements
as to coverage, yards and other open spaces; or
      (2)   In case the conversion will result in lot area per dwelling unit or
family, at least twenty percent (20%) greater than required for new buildings
in the district.
   (d)   Rear Dwellings. No building in the rear of a principal building on the
same lot shall be used for residential purposes unless it conforms to all yard
and other open space and off-street parking requirements of this Ordinance, and
for the purpose of determining the front yard in such cases, the rear line of
the required rear yard for the principal building shall be provided for any
such rear dwelling, an unoccupied and unobstructed accessway not less than ten
feet wide to a public street for each dwelling unit in such dwelling, or one
not less than thirty feet wide for three or more dwelling units.

transitional use shall be permitted on a lot, the side lot line of which
adjoins either directly or across an alley any B or I District. The permitted
transitional uses for any lot in an R-1 District shall be any use permitted in
an R-2 District; and for any lot in an R-2 District any use permitted in an R-
3 District. In the case of any such lot in an R-1 or R-2 District, the
requirements governing lot area per dwelling unit, off-street parking, yards
and other open spaces shall be the same as for the next following less
restricted district listed in Section
1121.05 (a). Any transitional use authorized under this section shall extend
not more 100 feet from the side lot line of the lot abutting on the zoning
district boundary line.
   (f)   Yard Requirements Along Boundary Line in a Less Restricted District.
Along any zoning boundary line on a lot adjoining such boundary line in a less
restricted district, any abutting side yard, rear yard or court, unless subject
to greater restrictions or requirements stipulated by other provisions of this
Ordinance, shall have minimum width and depth equal to the average of the
required minimum width or depth of such side yards, rear yards or courts in the
two districts on either side of such zoning boundary line. In cases where the
height of a proposed structure on such lot in a less restricted district is
greater than the maximum height permitted in the adjoining more restricted
district, the minimum depth or width of the side yard, rear yard or court for
such structure shall be determined by increasing the minimum width or depth for
the highest structure permitted in such more restricted district by one foot
for each two feet by which the proposed structure exceeds the maximum height
permitted in the more restricted district.

1127.01  PURPOSE.
   The Mixed Use District (MX) is established in order to achieve the following
purposes:
   (a)   Provide an opportunity for a mix of land uses consistent with the
City's Master Plan, while protecting the public health, safety, and general
welfare;
   (b)   Provide for and encourage a balanced, compatible mix of uses, rather
than a separation of uses, in a pedestrian-friendly environment;
   (c)   Establish development standards that allow for flexibility while
protecting adjacent property from undue adverse impacts; and,
   (d)   Reinforce or create community character within Mixed Use Developments
that is consistent with the City's Master Plan.
      (Ord. 2015-7. Passed 8-25-15.)
1127.02  ESTABLISHMENT AND DEFINITION OF MIXED USE DISTRICTS AND SUBSEQUENT
PROCEDURES FOR APPROVAL.
   In order to achieve the goals set forth in Section
1127.01, three (3) Mixed Use Districts are hereby established in accordance
with procedures for a zoning amendment as set forth in Chapter
1139.03, Amendments. The boundaries of each Mixed Use District shall be
indicated on the Official Zoning Map and shall be officially denoted as such.
   (a)   Riverfront District. This district is established to promote the
development of walkable and dense commercial and residential structures, both
horizontal and vertical, as not to adversely affect adjacent residential areas.
The regulations within this chapter are devised to promote investment in
locations where investment is otherwise impeded due to small lot sizes,
inefficient shape of lots, shallow depth of the zoning district on the street
frontage, the existing underutilized development, and to address development
that exhibits functional obsolescence. Development in this area should provide
facilities that create a safe, accessible, and pleasing environment for
pedestrians and bicyclists. The Huron Riverfront District is intended to:
      (1)   Encourage development that serves the daily needs of the community,
nearby residential areas, and visitors to the community;
      (2)   Emphasize entertainment based uses, such as restaurants, bars,
taverns and other entertainment uses, both indoor and outdoor, that encourage
activity and vitality;
      (3)   Provide small scale office, retail, specialty shops and other uses;
      (4)   Encourage development that exhibits the physical design
characteristics of sidewalk-oriented, store-front style shopping and office
space;
      (5)   Encourage development that offers multiple and complementary uses;
and,
      (6)   Promote the health and well-being of residents by encouraging
physical activity, alternative transportation, and greater social interaction.
   (b)   Civic District. The establishment of this overlay district is to
create alternative provisions for land development regulations to those
currently in place under the existing zoning district. The Civic district is
intended to promote the development of walkable and dense commercial and civic
spaces, and to address the existing underutilized development and development
that exhibits functional obsolescence. This district is intended to:
      (1)   Promote a cohesive mix of uses, including civic and public space,
commercial, service oriented, and other uses that have a direct relation with
the intended development of this district;
      (2)   Establish a vibrant community center;
      (3)   Encourage street-level commercial uses;
      (4)   Ensure organized development to prevent adverse effects of
disjointed development; and,
      (5)   Promote the health and well-being of residents by encouraging
physical activity, alternative transportation, and greater social interaction.
   (c)   Granary District. This district is established to ensure a cohesive
and vibrant mix of uses which are developed in conjunction with a broad
development plan. This section is intended to:
      (1)   Promote a mix of uses, including commercial, entertainment, retail,
night life, and residential space in a cohesive manner;
      (2)   Encourage development that serves a regional community as
envisioned within the City's Master Plan;
      (3)   Provide a large-scale regional center of commerce;
      (4)   Ensure organized development of large tracts of land and uses to
prevent adverse effects of disjointed development; and,
      (5)   Provide public access to the water front through greenspace,
walking areas, and view sheds. (Ord. 2015-7. Passed 8-25-15.)
1127.03  CONFORMITY TO STANDARDS, GENERAL DEVELOPMENT CONCEPTS, AND PROCEDURES
FOR APPROVAL.
   Given the special characteristics related to a Mixed Use District, specific
provisions governing the development of land for this purpose are required.
Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of this
Chapter and those of other Chapters of this Zoning Code, the provisions set
forth in this Chapter shall govern. Any existing provisions that are not
covered by this Chapter shall be governed by the respective provisions and
requirements found elsewhere in this Zoning Code, unless modified by the
General Development Concept as provided for below.
   In the event that implementation of this Chapter results in any parcel,
building, land, or use being classified as non-conforming according to Section
 1121.07 of the Huron Planning and Zoning Code, the procedures set forth in
Chapter
1121.07 shall be followed.
   As provided for in this Chapter, an applicant for a project within a Mixed
Use District shall submit to the City a General Development Concept for review
and approval. Such General Development Concept shall comply with all applicable
provisions of this Chapter and the Zoning Code. The submittal of an application
for the review of a General Development Concept shall include the maps,
building elevation drawings, site and landscape plans, list of uses within the
development, signage plan for the development, indication of traffic
circulation, and designs and supplementary documents required by the City of
Huron.
   When an applicant intends to use the zoning regulations set forth in the
Mixed Use District chapter, applications shall be reviewed and acted upon as
follows:
   (a)   A General Development Concept shall be submitted to the Zoning
Inspector and be subject to review by appropriate agencies prior to being
submitted to the Planning Commission. Upon completion of the initial staff
review, the General Development Concept will be forwarded to the Planning
Commission for review.
   (b)   The Planning Commission shall review a General Development Concept to
determine if such application complies with the review criteria set forth in
this Chapter and other applicable chapters or sections of this Zoning Code. The
Planning Commission shall, when formulating its decisions, determine that: (1)
the General Development Concept is consistent with the Master Plan, (2) the
development will result in a harmonious grouping of buildings within the
proposed development and the development will relate appropriately to existing
and proposed uses on adjacent property and existing public streets; and (3),
that the development includes adequate infrastructure for traffic, access, and
utility services.
   (c)   The Planning Commission may modify any applicable provisions and
requirements contained in this Zoning Code when approving a General Development
Concept, including the regulations in this Chapter, if it is shown by the
applicant that:
      (1)   There will be preservation of distinctive physical characteristics
of the site;
      (2)   Additional amenities or public spaces or increased efficiency in
public services will be provided; and,
      (3)   Through imaginative and skillful design in the arrangement of
buildings, open space, streets, access drives and other features, the
application results in a development of equivalent or higher quality than that
which could be achieved through strict application of the applicable provisions
and requirements of the zoning code; provided that the development, as
proposed, shall have no adverse impact upon the public health, safety or
general welfare of the City.
   (d)   Upon review of the General Development Concept, the Planning
Commission may approve, approve with modifications, or deny the application. If
the Planning Commission approves the General Development Concept, the Planning
Commission must forward any necessary development agreements or zoning
amendments necessary for execution of the General Development Concept to City
Council for approval. All development agreements shall be reviewed by the
City's Law Department prior to execution.
   (e)   Upon receiving a recommendation from the Planning Commission for
approval of any zoning amendments or development agreements necessary for the
proper execution of a General Development Concept, the City Council will review
the General Development Concept. Any zoning amendments shall be done in
accordance with procedures spelled out within section
1139.03 of the Zoning Code. Any development agreements shall be authorized in
the manner of a Resolution.
   (f)   Failure on the part of the Developer to conform to said plans included
within the General Development Concept, and/or applicable Municipal
requirements and/or the terms and conditions of the City's approval may be
grounds for action by the City. (Ord. 2015-7. Passed 8-25-15.)
1127.04  PERMITTED USES.
   Uses in accordance with Appendix A, Permitted Uses, may be considered as
part of a General Development Concept subject to all applicable requirements
contained in this Zoning Code. In determining the appropriateness of each
proposed use, the Planning Commission shall determine that the plan satisfies
one or more of the following:
   (a)   That the proposed uses will fulfill the Purpose, Section
1127.01;
   (b)   That the proposed uses are in accordance with the City's Master Plan;
and,

the proposed land uses will promote the desired mixture of uses either within
the proposed Mixed Use Development or with adjacent sites, and are developed in
a manner to compliment the proposed Mixed Use Development.
      (Ord. 2015-7. Passed 8-25-15.)
1127.05 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND CRITERIA.
   A Mixed Use Development shall be designed and depicted within a General
Development Concept. The proposed Mixed Use Development shall be designed in
accordance with accepted planning principles, including the planning and
development principles included in this Chapter and the City's Master Plan and
in compliance with the purposes and objectives of the Mixed Use regulations as
set forth in this Section. In the event that the specific regulations for each
district differ from those stated within this section, the regulations
pertaining to the proposed district shall govern.
   (a)   General Development Concept Criteria. A General Development Concept
shall be designed and depicted in accordance with the following:
      (1)   Public Street Access. The project area within any General
Development Concept shall front on an existing or planned public or private
street or way. In the event that the frontage of a developable lot is separated
from the public or private street by a pre-existing parking surface that
contains access to a public or private street, that lot is considered to have
frontage along the public or private street. The adjacent edge of the existing
parking surface shall be used for setback calculation. The access point(s) onto
such existing street shall minimize adverse impacts on surrounding properties.
The function of adjacent thoroughfares shall be maintained by limiting access
points to the minimum needed and relating them to existing access points.
      (2)   Landscaping, Screening, and Buffering. Each Mixed Use District is
subject to specific landscaping, screening, and buffering regulations to
fulfill the intent of the district. Landscaping shall be coordinated in design
and type of materials, mounding and fencing used. Landscaping may vary in
density, spacing and other treatments to reflect variations of topography,
existing landscape, or land uses. Appropriate buffer zones with adequate
landscaping shall be provided between the proposed Mixed Use Development and
adjacent areas in accordance with Chapter
1131 Landscape Requirements.
      (3)   Land Use and the Arrangement of Building Setbacks.
         A.   Buildings and uses within the Mixed Use Development shall be
located to reduce any adverse impacts and to enhance the character of areas
adjacent to the development.
         B.   Whenever a Mixed Use District includes areas of a higher density
or intensity than permitted in adjacent areas, the location and arrangement of
use areas shall include appropriate buffers, open spaces, setbacks, or other
transitional areas to ensure compatibility with the lower intensity areas. In
determining the appropriateness of proposed transitional areas, the Planning
Commission shall consider the relationship between adjacent land uses, existing
topography, existing natural features and vegetation, building size, and type
of adjacent land uses. To provide appropriate transitional areas, creative site
design, building design, incorporation of landscaping, and building arrangement
is strongly encouraged. Design alternatives include but are not limited to the
following:
            (i.)   Non-residential building facades facing residential
development shall have the appearance of a front façade including an
architectural appearance compatible with residential areas. Such building
designs and arrangements shall not appear to "back-up" to residential areas;
            (ii.)   Non-residential buildings with service and loading areas
entirely integrated into the building architecture and appropriately screened
from view;
            (iii.)   Buildings and lots shall have high quality and attractive
landscape features that provide adequate screening or buffering and are well
integrated into development design; and,
            (iv.)   Buildings and lots shall incorporate existing topographic
or natural features.
      (4)   Off-street Parking. The layout of parking areas, service areas, and
related entrances, exits, signs, lighting, noise sources or other potentially
adverse influences shall be designed and located to prevent and avoid adverse
impacts to the Mixed Use Development as well as those areas adjacent to the
Development.
      (5)   Internal Public and Private Streets. Public and private internal
streets shall be designed in accordance with the standards as set by Chapter
1119 Design Specifications, and Chapter

1127.06 BUILDING DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   In addition to the other regulations set forth in this Chapter, the building
design guidelines set forth in this Section shall apply to the exterior
appearance and design of all new construction and exterior building renovations
when development is occurring in conformance with an approved General
Development Concept in any Mixed Use District. When reviewing a General
Development Concept, the following criteria shall serve as guidelines for
evaluating the schematic building designs presented with such a General
Development Concept.
   (a)   General Criteria.
      (1)   The application shall enhance and improve the character of the
community and be appropriate and compatible with its surroundings and in
conformance with the character established for the area by the City's Master
Plan.
      (2)   Each building or unit of a multiple building development should
have its own distinct identity, yet should also be compatible with adjacent
units or buildings in terms of proportion, color, and materials.
      (3)   Where natural or existing topographic patterns positively
contribute to the appearance and utility of a development, they shall be
preserved and developed, particularly shorelines. Modification to topography
may be permitted only when such modifications do not adversely affect
surrounding property.
      (4)   Safe pedestrian and bicycle connections shall be provided between
buildings, in a multi-building development, and between principal buildings,
their parking lots, and public sidewalks.
   (b)   Criteria for the Design of Buildings.
      (1)   Facades of every building facing a public right-of-way have glazing
areas, equal to or greater than sixty percent (60%) of the area (measured using
the total area below the second floor).
      (2)    Excluding the end wall of residential floors, for all upper
floors, all facades facing a public-right-of-way of every building shall have
glazed areas equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of the total area of the front
facade, with each floor being calculated independently.
      (3)   For any façade of the building, other than the front façade, that
is visible from a private access drive, parking area, or public circulation
area shall have no more than twenty (20) feet of contiguous wall length devoid
of windows, on any ground floor, unless the wall includes architectural
features such as piers, columns, defined bays, or an undulation of the building
so that a pedestrian scale, rhythm, and visual interest is created.
      (4)   All roof-top equipment shall be enclosed in building materials that
match the structure or which are visually compatible with the structure.
      (5)   All dumpsters / large trash receptacles must be fully enclosed by a
fence, swing gate or other structure using materials that match the primary
structure or are visually compatible with the primary structure.
      (6)   Building materials within three (3) feet of the finished grade or
sidewalk shall be of a durable material to withstand pedestrian and vehicular
traffic. No stucco (commonly known as "dry-vit" or E.F.I.S.) or similar
materials shall be permitted within three (3) feet of the finished grade.
      (7)   Buildings located at street intersections and other important
pedestrian or automobile entry points shall employ distinctive architectural
features to distinguish these areas.

   (a)   Building Siting and Orientation. The following shall apply to building
siting and orientation requirements within this district:
      (1)   Residential use. The front wall of the principal structure shall be
parallel to the street, or parallel to a radius of the curve of the street, if
the street is curved.
      (2)   Residential use, corner lot. The principal residential entrance to
the structure shall face one of streets that the lot abuts. One side of the
building shall be designated as the front, and shall be subject to the building
design guidelines within this chapter.
      (3)   Commercial. Buildings shall maintain a continuous wall plane at the
front property line. Architectural features may project beyond the allowable
setback by up to three (3) feet at a minimum height of twelve (12) feet above
the sidewalk. The front wall of the principal structure shall be parallel to
the street, or parallel to a radius of the curve of the street, if the street
is curved.
      (4)   Buildings located at street intersections. When located at an area
noted on the Thoroughfare Map as important pedestrian or automobile entry
points, the project shall employ distinctive architectural features and site
design features to distinguish these areas.
      (5)   Screening from Residential Property. Screening along rear and side
lot lines abutting residential properties is required, consistent with Chapter
1131 Landscape Requirements.
      (6)   Entrance Orientation. The primary building entrances shall be
oriented to the abutting public street. Additional entrances may be oriented to
a secondary street or parking area. If the development abuts multiple public
streets, an entrance may be placed fronting each. Entrances shall be clearly
visible and identifiable from the street and delineated with elements such as
roof overhangs, recessed entries, landscaping, and/or similar design features.
   (b)   Uses. Permitted, conditional, and accessory uses may occur within each
building type as specified in Appendix A, Permitted Uses.
   (c)   Parking. The Mixed Use Riverfront District is intended to have a
higher density of development and therefore strongly encourages the most
productive use of land within the district. Because of the unique conditions of
the lots within this district, provision of off-street parking in the manner
prescribed under Chapter
1133 Off-street Parking and Loading Regulations would result in undesirable
land use. Therefore, the following regulations apply for the provision of off-
street parking within the MU - RFD:
      (1)   Requirements. No off-street parking is required for nonresidential
uses within the MU - RFD, unless such use exceeds 2,500 square feet of net
floor area, in which case off-street parking must be provided for only the
floor area in excess of 2,000 square feet of net floor area at a rate of 75% of
the required amount per Chapter
1133 Off-street Parking and Loading Regulations.
      (2)   Location. Surface parking shall not be located between the front
façade of a building and the abutting street. Parking areas, shall be located
on the rear or side of the building, except in the event that the frontage of a
developable lot is separated from the public or private street by a pre-
existing parking surface that contains access to a public or private street. In
the event that the proposed project backs up to the Riverfront, parking should
be kept on the side of the building.
      (3)   Shared. A district-wide approach to off-street parking for
nonresidential uses is preferred within this district. Off-street parking for
these uses may be located up to three hundred (300) feet away from the
principal entrance. Off-street structured parking may be located up to five
hundred (500) feet away from the principal entrance. If multiple principal
buildings are part of one General Development Concept, each use shall be
considered separately for calculation of parking required. One main parking
surface area can be used to provide parking for each use within the General
Development Concept. Finally, on-street parking may be used in the calculation
of required parking if the space is within two-hundred (200) feet of the
principal entrance of the building.
      (4)   Bicycle Parking. All uses listed within Appendix A, Permitted Uses
are required to include short-term bicycle parking facilities, unless already
installed by the City. One (1) space per five-hundred (500) square feet of
gross floor area for commercial uses must be provided in conjunction with the
following regulations:
         (A)   All required bicycle spaces must be located on the same lot. The
property owner may also make arrangements with the City to place bike parking
spaces in the public right-of-way, pending approval of the Planning Commission.
         (B)   The bicycle parking spaces must be convenient to building
entrances and street access, but may not interfere with normal pedestrian and
vehicle traffic. For passive security purposes, the bike parking shall be well-
lit and clearly visible to building occupants or clearly visible from the
street.
         (C)   Bicyclists must not be required to travel over stairs or other
obstacles to access bicycle parking.
         (D)   Short-term bicycle parking spaces must be located no more than
fifty (50) feet from the principal building entrance and at the same grade as
the sidewalk or other pedestrian accessible routes.
   (d)   Signs.
      (1)   The installation and maintenance of signage shall be done in
accordance with Chapter
1129 Sign Regulations and the provisions this section. Additional signage
regulations for this district include the following:
         (A)   Pole signs are prohibited.
         (B)   Wall and projecting signs are encouraged. Projecting signs may
be up to six (6) feet in height on one-story buildings and twelve (12) feet in
height on two (2) or more story buildings. Signs must not project further than
three (3) feet from the part of the building the sign is affixed to. All
projecting signs shall be placed so that the base of the sign is at least
twelve ten 12 10 feet above ground level, except when the projecting sign is
located above a landscaped area or other area that does not permit pedestrian
or vehicular traffic beneath the sign, in which case the sign must be placed so
that the base of the sign is at least six (6) feet above ground level.
         (C)   Signs may only have external illumination.
         (D)   Temporary business signs may be utilized within this district.
freestanding by weight of at least thirty-five (35) pounds, and is limited to
two (2) sides, with no side exceeding eight (8) square feet in size. The signs
may be utilized for advertising during business hours. Temporary business signs
shall not be placed in the public right-of-way without approval of the city.
   (e)   Landscaping, Screening, and Buffering.
      (1)   Landscaping is generally difficult due to the unique circumstances
within this district and requirements for the same are therefore limited.
Landscaping will generally be included as part of the City's streetscape along
Main Street.
      (2)   Buffer yards must be provided in accordance with Chapter
1131 Landscape Requirements.
      (3)   Any open area between the building and the public right-of-way not
dedicated for walkways or access lanes, must have plant or ground cover at a
minimum.
   (f)   Building Façade.
      (1)   All facades of any building in this district facing a public right-
of-way shall have glazing areas, equal to or greater than sixty percent (60%)
of the facade area (measured using the total area below the second floor).
      (2)   Excluding the end wall of residential floors, for all upper floors,
all facades facing a public-right-of-way of every building shall have glazed
areas equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of the total area of the front facade,
with each floor being calculated independently.
   (g)   Sidewalks and Pedestrian Amenities.
      (1)   Sidewalks the width of the public right-of-way shall be included
along the entire width of the site frontage along any public street classified
as downtown core per the City's adopted Thoroughfare Plan. Sidewalks five (5)
feet in width shall be provided along any street or alley not classified as a
downtown core public street.
      (2)   Pedestrian walkways shall be designed to be visually attractive and
distinguishable from driving surfaces through use of durable, low-maintenance
surface materials such as pavers, brick, or concrete.
      (3)   To the maximum extent possible, provisions shall be made for
connections with existing pedestrian systems on adjoining properties, including
sidewalks, bikeways, walkways or other modes of pedestrian traffic.
   (h)   Curb Cuts and Access Points. Curb Cuts and Access Points shall be
placed in a way as to not disrupt pedestrian traffic and pose possible
pedestrian safety conflicts. Curb cuts and access points shall be limited to as
few as necessary within this district.
   (i)   Outdoor Displays. Outdoor displays for merchandise are generally
permitted within this district. Displays are limited in size and location. Any
structure or display shall not impede with fluid and safe pedestrian and
vehicular traffic. The structure shall not exceed five (5) feet in height nor
shall it be closer than four (4) feet to the nearest curb as to maintain a
clear path for pedestrians. Additionally, outdoor displays shall not be placed
within twenty (20) feet of the point of intersection of the right-of-way lines
of any street intersection to avoid potential sight-line issues for pedestrian
and vehicular traffic. The display shall not encompass more than ten percent
(10%) of the building's street frontage. Outdoor displays may only be setup
between the hours of 8 AM and midnight. Design standards and placement are
subject to administrative approval by the Zoning Inspector.

Development Concept may be approved by the Planning Commission upon finding
that the variations are generally in keeping with the spirit and concept of the
approved General Development Concept, in accordance with the conditions
required by the City Council in its approval, and in accordance with the
requirements of this Chapter. For the purposes of this Section, a minor
variation shall include:
      (1)   Small, incidental alterations to the location or number of spaces
in off-street, surface parking lots.
      (2)   Small, incidental construction of accessory structures;

1129.02  APPLICATION OF SIGN REGULATIONS.
   The regulations and standards contained in this chapter shall apply to signs
outside of the public right of way. A sign may only be erected, established,
painted, created or maintained in conformance with the standards, procedures,
exemptions and other requirements of this chapter.
   (a)   No signs shall be permitted in the public right of way, except for the
following:
      (1)   Public / Safety signs erected by or on behalf of a governmental
body, when approved by the City, to post legal notices, identify public
property, convey public information, and direct or regulate pedestrian or
vehicular traffic;
      (2)   Informational signs of a public utility regarding its poles, lines,
pipes, or facilities; and,
      (3)   Awning, marquee and projecting signs projecting over a public right
of way in conformity with the conditions of Section
 1129.04 (i.e. maximum area and number of signs) and the height clearance
conditions in Section
1129.05(c).
   (b)   No sign is permitted to be installed or placed on public property,
except in conformance with the requirements of this section. Any such sign
shall be forfeited and subject to confiscation. In addition to other remedies
hereunder, the City shall have the right to recover from the owner or person
placing such a sign the full costs of removal and disposal of such sign and any
damages caused to public property.
   (c)   The City shall have, and is hereby granted, the authority to revoke
any permit granted hereunder, and is granted the authority to order any sign
maintained in violation of any provision of this section to be altered,
repaired, changed, reconstructed, demolished, or removed as may be necessary to
conform hereto. Such work or act shall be completed with ten (10) calendar days
of the date of such order.
      (Ord. 2015-8. Passed 8-25-15.)
1129.03 COMPUTATIONS.
   The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign
height.
   (a)   Determining Building Frontage and Building Unit. The building frontage
shall be the length of the building which faces the principal street. In the
event that due to the unique nature of the site, building, or parcel, the
principal entrance to the uses therein is located on any side of a building
that is not adjacent to the principal street, one (1) additional sign is
permitted to clearly delineate the location of the entrance.
      (1)   In the case of an irregular wall surface, a straight line extended
along such wall surface shall be used to measure the length.
      (2)   Only one (1) exterior wall of any business shall be considered its
frontage. If the building is located on a corner lot, only one side of the
building shall be used to calculate frontage. In this instance, it shall be the
Planning Commission's discretion as to which side of the building is considered
to front a principal street.
      (3)   For multi-tenant buildings, the portion of a building which is
owned or leased by a single tenant shall be considered a building unit.
      (4)   The length of a building unit is that portion of the building so
occupied by a single activity and calculated in the same manner as the building
frontage.
   (b)   Determining Sign Area or Dimension. Signs may be displayed as
freestanding ground signs, wall signs, roof signs, window signs and projecting
signs within the limitations and restrictions as further described by this
Chapter, provided the items of information allowance authorized by this Section
is not exceeded.
      (1)   For a sign which is framed, outlined, painted and otherwise
prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area
shall include the entire portion within the outside dimensions of the
background or frame.
      (2)   Signs should be commonly designed as part of the building or
architectural style and not just be unrelated areas with lettering.
      (3)   For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures, or elements on
a wall or similar surface, or an irregularly shaped freestanding or projecting
sign, the area of the sign shall encompass a regular geometric shape or a
combination of regular geometric shapes which form, or approximate, the
perimeter of all the elements in the display. When separate elements are
organized to form a single sign but the elements are separated by open space,
the area shall be calculated by determining the geometric form or combination
of forms which comprise all the display area including the space between the
elements. See Figure 1129.03 below:
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/6178426d4b8e953af513bde6f3813a843f62dfb8/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3465.jpg]
      (4)   The sign area shall include the frame, but shall not include the
pole or other necessary structural support unless such pole or structural
support is illuminated or otherwise so designated to constitute a display
surface or device.
      (5)   A freestanding sign shall have no more than two (2) display
surfaces provided that the two (2) display surfaces are arranged back-to-back,
and not more than eighteen (18) inches from each other. No more than two (2)
display faces shall be permitted. Only one (1) display surface is used in
computing total signage area.
      (6)   In the event there is a dispute in determining the sign area or any
sign dimension, the Planning Commission shall have the final responsibility for
making such determination.
   (c)   Determining Sign Height. The height of a freestanding sign shall be
measured from the finished grade of the site to the top of the highest element
of the sign. All freestanding signs on a man-made base, including a graded
earth mound, shall be measured from the average site grade prior to the
addition of the sign. The height of a temporary freestanding sign in a
residential district shall be measured from the grade at the base of the
signpost to the top of the highest element. See Schedule
1129.05(d)
   (d)   Determining Window Area. The window area of a building shall be the
total glass area of windows on the first floor of the wall of the building
facing the primary frontage, provided that for the purposes of these
regulations, the height of windows on the first floor shall be that portion of
the window within fifteen (15) feet of the grade.
      (Ord. 2015-8. Passed 8-25-15.)
1129.04 MAXIMUM SIGN AREAS PERMITTED.
   Signs as permitted in the respective zoning districts shall conform to the
maximum area and number of signs requirements in Appendix A - Maximum Signage
Area, unless regulations are otherwise specified in this Zoning Code. Signage

   (a)   Enhance the aesthetic appearance of the community by providing minimum
standards related to the quality and functional aspects of landscaping.
   (b)   Reduce incompatibility with abutting land uses, and between land uses
and public rights-of-way through provision of landscape screening or buffers.
   (c)   Provide for the conservation of water through appropriate planting
techniques, appropriate mix of plant materials, and regular maintenance of
landscaped areas.
   (d)   Protect public health, safety, general welfare, and property valuation
by preserving and enhancing the aesthetic quality of the City.
      (Ord. 2015-9. Passed 8-25-15.)
1131.02  LANDSCAPE PLAN REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Landscape Plan Required.  A landscape plan must be submitted as part
of any site plan submission, upon any substantial expansion or alteration to a
commercial building as defined by the Ohio Building Code, or any change in use
of a building, and for any residential subdivision that will result in the
creation of ten (10) or more individual lots, or a condominium or multi-family
project of four (4) or more residential units. The landscape plan is subject to
review and approval by the Planning Commission as part of any planned
development, or site plan, and must be approved prior to the issuance of a
building permit and/or implemented prior to the certificate of occupancy.
   (b)   Content of Landscape Plan. A landscape plan drawn to scale must
contain the following information:
      (1)   The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed
structures, signs, fences, landscape yards and areas, recreational facilities,
and refuse disposal areas;
      (2)   Property lines;
      (3)   Any easements located on the lot;
      (4)   Parking lots and drives, roadways and rights-of-way, bicycle paths,
walkways and sidewalks;
      (5)   Location of all existing and proposed electrical equipment, water
mains, sanitary and storm sewer lines, and drainage facilities. Other
freestanding structures shall be included as well, but do not need specific
dimensions;
      (6)   The location, quantity, size, common and botanical name and
condition of existing trees with a trunk caliper of six (6) inches or more on
the site;
      (7)   The location, quantity, size, common and botanical name and
condition of trees in the right-of-way, indicating trees to be retained and
removed;
      (8)   The location, quantity, size, common and botanical name of all
proposed plant material including, but not limited to, shade, ornamental and
evergreen trees, shrubs, groundcover, annuals/perennials and turf. All plant
materials and quantities should be denoted in an easily readable table format
and noted on the landscape plan as shown in their proposed location;
      (9)   Any proposed changes to the grade of the site shall be indicated on
the landscape plan in 2-foot contour intervals;
      (10)   Elevations of all proposed fences, walls, steps, and fixed
retaining walls (cast concrete, unitized walls) on the site; and,
      (11)   An on-site water management plan shall also be included per
Section
1115.03: Storm Water Drainage Standards.
   
   (c)   Minor Changes to Approved Landscape Plans. Minor changes to an
approved landscape plan that do not result in a reduction in the net amount of
plant material as specified on the approved landscape plan may be approved by
the Zoning Inspector. Changes to the size and amount of plant materials of an
approved landscape plan are not considered a minor change. Major changes must
be approved by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 2015-9. Passed 8-25-15.)
1131.03 SELECTION, INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT MATERIALS.
   All portions of the lot not covered by permitted structures, impervious, or
pervious surfaces shall be landscaped with grass, trees, shrubbery and/or other
appropriate ground cover or landscaping material, which at all times shall be
maintained in accordance with the City's adopted property maintenance
standards.
   (a)   Selection. All planting materials used must be of good quality and
meet the "American Standard for Nursery Stock," latest edition, as published by
AmericanHort, for sizes, grading, root spread, dimension of root ball, and
quality. The use of native species is encouraged. Size and density of plant
material, both at the time of planting and at maturity, are additional criteria
to be considered when selecting plant material. Plant material must be selected
for its form, texture, color, pattern of growth and suitability to local
conditions. All trees and vegetation planted shall be common to northern Ohio
or similar climates. All trees and vegetation must be in good condition, free
of cultural or mechanical injury, insect eggs or their larvae, and plant
diseases.
   (b)   Installation.  All landscaping materials must be installed in
accordance with the current planting procedures established by AmericanHort.
Planting material should be grown in a climate similar to or more severe than
that of Huron and be typical of its species in branch structure. All plant
material must be installed so that soil is of sufficient volume, composition
and nutrient balance to sustain healthy growth. All new trees shall be staked
and mulched upon installation.
   (c)   Planting Arrangement. Trees, shrubs and other materials shall be
arranged to create varied and attractive views and plant material should
provide a variety of color displayed throughout the year.
   (d)   Drought Tolerant Plant and Water-Efficient Landscape Requirements.
Plant selection should incorporate drought-tolerant species wherever possible.
   (e)   Maintenance.  Landscaping materials must be maintained in good
condition, present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance, and kept free of
weeds, refuse and debris. Fences, steps, retaining walls and similar
landscaping elements must be maintained in good repair. The applicant, property
owner, and/or subsequent or successor owner, and their agents, including
tenants, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance, repair
and replacement of all landscape materials, fences, steps, retaining walls and
similar landscaping elements, and refuse disposal areas. Irrigation systems,
when provided, must be maintained in good operating condition. If any of the
above are found to be in disrepair according to the standards of the City's
adopted property maintenance standards, the City will undertake enforcement
initiatives in line with the City's nuisance and abatement procedures. (Ord.
2015-9. Passed 8-25-15.)
1131.04 GENERAL LANDSCAPE DESIGN STANDARDS.
   Landscape plans, as described above will be evaluated and approved based on
the following design criteria:
   (a)   Scale and Nature of Landscape Material. The scale and nature of
landscape materials must be appropriate to the size of the site and related
structures.
   (b)   Shade Trees. All deciduous shade trees at the time of installation
shall have a minimum caliper of two and one-half (2.5) inches and a clear trunk
height of at least six (6) feet, unless otherwise specified. Caliper of the
trunk is taken at four and one-half feet (4.5) above the grade line on the
uphill side of the tree. The ground line includes the duff layer that may be
present, but does not include unincorporated woody debris that may rise above
the ground line.
   (c)   Evergreen Trees. Evergreen trees must have a minimum height of six (6)
feet at installation.
   (d)   Ornamental Trees.  Single stem ornamental trees must have a minimum
caliper of two (2) inches taken at height referenced in
 1131.04(b), unless otherwise specified. Multiple stem ornamental trees must
have a minimum height of eight (8) feet at planting.
   (e)   Shrubs.  The minimum height at installation of all shrubs must meet
the dimensions of Schedule
1131.04(e). Large shrubs are those species that reach five (5) or more feet in
height at maturity. Small shrubs are those species that should be kept at
heights of fifteen (15) to thirty-six (36) inches.
SCHEDULE 1131.04(e): SHRUB INSTALLATION SPECIFICATIONS
SHRUB TYPE                   MINIMUM DIMENSION AT INSTALLATION
Deciduous, Large             3 feet in height
Deciduous, Small             15 inches in height
Evergreen, conifers (small)  18 to 24 inches in height
Evergreen, conifers (large)  6 feet in height
Evergreen, broadleaf (small) 1-1/2 feet (wide/spread)
Evergreen, broadleaf (large) 2-1/2 feet (wide/spread)
 
   (f)   Perennials and Groundcovers. Unless otherwise specified, perennials
and groundcovers must be a minimum of four (4) inch container stock and maximum
twelve (12) inch on-center spacing.
   (g)   Mulch. Unless otherwise specified, mulch must be a minimum two (2) and
a maximum of four (4) inch dressing and must be applied on all exposed soil
surfaces of planting areas except turf, creeping or rooting groundcovers, or
direct seeding applications. Bare soil should be left at the base of the plant
to avoid trunk suffocation or rot.
   (h)   General Landscape Requirements. Table
1131.04(h) shows the minimum amount of landscape materials required per site.
The quantities are inclusive of total aggregate shade trees and number of
landscape units. The quantities are subject to the use of the principal
building and total footprint of the site. The requirements within this section
are to be included in addition to any required buffering, screening, building
façade, or parking lot landscape requirements. Shade trees can be placed
anywhere on the lot meeting all other requirements of this Code. Landscape
islands shall be placed as to create visual interest and increase the aesthetic
quality of the site and building façade.

                                                          perennials.
 
   *   When figuring the number of landscape islands or quantity of plant
material required, round the total number of plants required up to the nearest
whole number.
   *   A minimum of 50% of each landscape island shall be covered in planting
materials. The entire landscape area left free from plantings shall be covered
with mulch, wood chips, landscape stones, or similar materials.
   (i)   Building façade landscaping. In any Business (B) or Mixed Use (MU)
district, any flat expanse of a principal building façade that faces or is
clearly visible from the public right-of-way and encompasses over 50% of the
length of the adjacent lot line, shall include landscape material and plantings
along the base of the façade. In the event the building shape is not parallel
to the lot line, the façade shall be compared against the shorter of the
adjoining lot lines. This provision is only applicable if landscaping will not
result in a reduction of parking or inhibit the ability to provide safe and
effective pedestrian and vehicular access to the principal building.
   (j)   Generally Acceptable Landscape Materials. A list of generally
acceptable plant shall be on file with the City and is available for reference
for selection of landscape materials.
   (k)   Reduction. The Planning Commission may reduce the required quantity of
landscape material as specified in this Code based upon the existence of
certain site specific circumstances, including insufficient open space or the
potential to negatively impact the site's safety by implementing these
requirements.
   (l)   Species Diversity.  Diversity among required plant material for on-
site landscaping is encouraged to enhance visual interest and reduce the risk
of losing a large population of plants due to diseases or pests. Schedule
1131.04 (k) indicates the percentage of diversity required based on the total
quantity of the same species of plant to be used. As an example: if a landscape
plan calls for 5-10 shade trees, there must be at least two (2) species of
shade trees used, with a maximum of 60% of those being of one species and a
minimum of 40% of those being of another.

1131.05  PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING.
   (a)   Perimeter Parking Lot Landscaping. Perimeter parking lot landscaping
is required in the instance that any portion of the parking surface is within
twenty (20) feet of a public right-of-way or abuts any residentially zoned
district. Landscaping shall be placed along any edge or surface that generally
faces the right-of-way to screen the parking area from view of pedestrian and
vehicular traffic. Perimeter parking lot landscaping provides for the
enhancement and screening of parking lots and enhancement of the streetscape.
The perimeter parking lot landscape yard must be improved as follows:
      (1)   The perimeter landscaping must be a minimum of ten (10) feet in
depth when abutting a residential district and five (5) feet in depth when
facing a public right-of-way. In both cases it must span the full length of the
parking surface that either abuts a residentially zoned district or faces the
public right-of-way.
      (2)   Parking Lot screening when abutting residential district. A single
hedge row is required to be planted with one (1) shrub every forty-eight (48)
inches on center, spaced linearly. The shrubs must measure a minimum of of
thirty-six (36) inches at installation.
      (3)   Public Right-of-Way Parking Lot Screening. Any materials, including
plantings or decorative materials used within the landscape to screen the area
from the view of the public right-of-way shall not exceed six (6) in height.
Plants shall be spaced evenly and consist of a combination of hedges, shrubs,
perennials, and live ground cover. Perimeter landscape yards shall be designed
to enhance the streetscape, yet not hinder the use or safe flow of pedestrian
and vehicular traffic. Any remaining area between the landscape yard and the
curb not dedicated for walkways, accessory uses, access lanes, or other
approved uses shall be covered with turf or ground cover at a minimum.
      (4)   Alternatively, a low landscape wall or ornamental fencing the
height of which provides effective screening may be used instead of shrubs.
Where possible, plant materials must be installed between the public right-of-
way and the wall to provide a softening effect on the wall.
      (5)   All perimeter parking lot landscaping areas must be protected on
the side adjacent the parking lot with raised curb. Curb openings are required
to allow water to infiltrate into the landscape areas as permitted by grading.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3476.jpg]
   (b)   Interior Parking Lot Landscaping.
      (1)   For parking lots consisting of twenty (20) or more spaces, interior
parking lot landscaping is required.
      (2)   One (1) parking lot island must be provided for every fifteen (15)
parking spaces. As part of the landscape plan approval, parking lot island
locations may be varied based on specific site requirements or design scheme,
to be approved as part of the landscape plan, but the total number of islands
must be no less than the amount required one (1) island for every fifteen (15)
spaces. Where feasible, all rows of parking must terminate with a landscape
island.
      (3)   Parking lot islands and peninsulas must be at least the length of
the adjacent parking spaces and six (6) feet wide measured across.
      (4)   Landscaping shall not be installed as to interfere with the safe
travels of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic, or to encroach upon proper
sight-line clearances.
      (5)   Parking lot islands must be designed in order to employ sustainable
storm water runoff. All islands and landscaped areas must be properly drained
to ensure survivability.
      (6)   The following plantings are required in parking lot islands and
landscaped areas:
         A.    Small shade trees or ornamental trees must be the primary plant
materials used in parking lot islands and landscaped areas. Shrubs, hedges and
other plant materials may be used to supplement the primary plantings but must
not create sight line visibility concerns for automobiles and pedestrians.
         B.   The remaining area of a parking lot island must be covered with
shrubs, turf, live groundcover, perennials or ornamental grasses. Mulch is
required to fill in planting areas for early growth protection until the
groundcover is established and covers the planting area. It is encouraged to
mulch bare areas for three (3) to five (5) years, or until the plant material
is fully established in the parking islands.
            (Ord. 2015-9. Passed 8-25-15.)
1131.06  BUFFER YARDS.
   (a)   Purpose.  Buffer yards are required in certain instances to establish
an appropriate transition between adjacent land uses that differ in intensity,
use, and density by clarifying the delineation between properties and creating
attractive and effective buffers between uses. The type and extent of the
buffer yard will be dictated by the relationship between the two adjacent land
uses, with the width, length, and density of the materials increasing as the
difference between the adjacent land uses increases. The buffer yard shall
serve to protect and preserve the aesthetic appeal and scenic beauty of the
parcels, reduce the impact of noise, reduce storm-water runoff, and create
visual spatial breaks between various land uses, and other incompatible
elements and of adjacent properties.
   (b)   Applicability. This section is applicable to all commercial
development upon land that is subject to site plan approval. Residential
developments are only subject to this requirement in the instance that ten (10)
or more dwelling units are greatly altered or constructed as part of one site
plan.
   (c)   Types. There are four (4) pre-established types of buffer yards.
Appendix A shall be used to dictate the type of buffer yard necessary and shall
be included within the landscape plan. These yards are described as:
      (1)   Type A: A peripheral planting strip intended to separate uses,
provide vegetation and greenery in potentially densely developed areas, and
enhance the appearance of individual properties.
      (2)   Type B: A low-density screen intended to serve as an intermittent
visual obstruction to partially block visual contact between uses.
      (3)   Type C: A medium density, semi-opaque, screen intended to
substantially block visual contact between uses.
      (4)   Type D: A high-density, opaque, screen intended to substantially
block visual contact between uses. This type of buffer is also intended to
block noise that has potential to negatively impact adjacent uses.
   (d)   Buffer Yard Design Standards. Buffer yards shall be installed using
the following requirements:
      (1)   Width. Each type of buffer yard is subject to a specific width. The
width of the yard is measured based on a perpendicular angle to the adjacent
property line.
      (2)   Length. Each type of buffer yard is subject to a specific length.
The length of the yard must span the specific length in percent of the adjacent
property line.
      (3)   Design and building standards are included in table
1131.06(d).

   (e)   Responsibility and Maintenance. It shall be the responsibility or
joint responsibility of the applicant, property owner(s), agents of the owner
(s), and tenants of the property to provide and install the buffer yard
required by Table
1131.06 (d). All landscaping materials must be maintained in good condition,
present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance, and kept free of weeds, refuse
and debris. Fences, steps, retaining walls and similar landscaping elements
must be maintained in good repair. The applicant, property owner, and/or
subsequent or successor owner, and their agents, including tenants, shall be
jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance, repair and replacement
of all landscape materials, fences, steps, retaining walls and similar
landscaping elements, and refuse disposal areas. Irrigation systems, when
provided, must be maintained in good operating condition to promote the health
of the plant material and the conservation of water. If any of the above are
found to be in disrepair according to the standards of the City's adopted
property maintenance standards, the City will undertake enforcement initiatives
in line with the City's nuisance and abatement procedures.
   (f)   Permitted Uses.  The following activities are permitted within a
buffer yard provided that none of the required plant material is eliminated or
damaged, the total width of the yard is maintained, and the yard still
accomplishes the appropriate level of screening: passive and active recreation,
outdoor picnic and sitting areas, storm water retention basins, and general
open green space.
   (g)   Modifications to Buffering and Screening Requirements. Buffer yards
required by this Chapter shall be applied equally to all similarly situated
properties. The Planning Commission is empowered to modify the above buffer
yard and screening requirements when it determines that:
      (1)   Natural land characteristics, such as topography or existing
vegetation on the proposed building site, would achieve the same intent as this
Section.
      (2)   Innovative landscaping or architectural design is employed on the
building site to achieve an equivalent screening and buffering effect.
      (3)   The required screening and landscaping would be ineffective at
maturity due to the proposed topography of the site, and/or the location of the
improvements on the site.
      (4)   The topography of adjacent and surrounding sites is such as to
render required screening ineffective at maturity.
      (5)   It can be clearly demonstrated that it is highly improbable that
the abutting property will be developed for residential purposes due to
circumstances that have taken place since the adoption of the Master Plan and
this Code.
      (6)   The Planning Commission may take into account site specific
circumstances regarding existing and future land use when applying these
standards and may impose or reduce the amount of screening necessary.
         (Ord. 2015-9. Passed 8-25-15.)
1131.07  SCREENING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Refuse Disposal Dumpsters and Refuse Storage Areas. All refuse
disposal dumpsters, containers and refuse storage areas must be fully enclosed
on four (4) sides by a solid wood or simulated wood screen fence, an opaque
masonry wall (stone, stucco or brick) or principal structure wall at least one
(1) foot higher that the tallest refuse container in the collection area, but
in no case shall the wall or fence be less than six (6) feet in height. The
base of the exterior portion of the screening infrastructure shall be
landscaped to soften the appearance of the screening wall. The enclosure must
be gated. The gate must be opaque, fully operational at all times, and closed
while not in use. The materials used for screening, including the enclosure and
gate, must complement the architecture of the principal building. An extension
of an exterior principal building wall may be used as one or more of the
screening walls for a refuse container, provided that the wall is six (6) feet
in height and is of the same building materials as the principal building. The
wall may not serve as the required gated enclosure. The location of refuse
containers is subject to approval by the Planning Commission, but is prohibited
within the front yard.
   (b)   Loading Docks / Areas. Where feasible, loading docks / areas must be
located and oriented so as not to be visible from the street and adjacent
properties, while still allowing access to the use served. In addition, loading
areas must be screened as much as possible, unless such screening is determined
unnecessary by the Planning Commission. Such screening must consist of an
opaque masonry wall (stone, stucco or brick), a solid wood or simulated wood
screen fence six (6) feet in height, or natural landscaped materials, or any
combination thereof that achieves desired level of screening.
   (c)   Outdoor Storage and Display Areas.
      (1)   Outdoor Storage.
         A.   All outdoor storage areas must be completely screened by an
opaque masonry wall (stone, stucco or brick), a solid wood or simulated wood
screen fence. Where feasible, plant materials must be installed along the fence
or wall facing the public right-of-way to provide a softening effect. No
materials stored outdoors may exceed the height of the required fence or wall
with the exception of construction material with a maximum height of fifteen
(15) feet if within any Business district and twenty (20) feet if within any
Industrial district.
         B.   Outdoor storage areas shall be graded and/or paved with semi-
pervious materials to allow for appropriate drainage of all accumulated surface
water.
         C.   Lighting shall be placed and appropriately shielded as to not
adversely impact adjacent properties.
         D.   No outdoor storage units shall be in the front yard of the lot,
or side lot if abutting a public street.
         E.   Storage areas shall be made inaccessible to the public via
physical barriers.
         F.   No outdoor storage unit shall be within twenty-five (25) feet of
the public right-of-way and/or within a front yard.
         G.   Outdoor storage areas may be used to store tires. Storage of
tires must be done in a manner that complies with all local health regulations,
shall not occupy a space larger than 300 square feet, and shall be neatly
stacked with no stack exceeding eight (8) feet in height.
         H.   Exceptions.  The following uses are exempt from these rules:
            (i)   Outdoor display/storage for the seasonal sale of live plant
material. This does not include rock, mulch, pavers, building materials, other
landscape materials, or lumber yards.
            (ii)   Sale and display areas for automobile, boat, similar
passenger recreational vehicles, farm equipment, and truck and trailer rentals.
         I.   Flexibility. The Planning Commission may waive these requirements
if they deem the inclusion does not serve a public purpose.
      (2)   Outdoor Sales and Display Areas. The use of outdoor display and
sales areas is permitted within any commercial district. The following
standards apply, unless otherwise noted within specific section of the code
defining the respective district.
         A.   When the rear or interior side yard of an outdoor display area
abuts a residential district, the outdoor display area must be effectively
screened from view by an opaque masonry wall (stone, stucco or brick), a solid
wood or simulated wood screen fence or dense evergreen hedge six (6) feet in
height.
         B.   Outdoor display areas located within ten (10) feet of the public
right-of-way shall have a landscaped yard along the full length of the
perimeter facing the public right-of-way. Landscaping shall be placed along any
portion that generally faces the right-of-way to screen the parking area from
view of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
         C.   Outdoor display areas located within fifty (50) feet of the
public Right-of-Way shall not exceed ten (10) feet in height and shall be total
screened in accordance with this section. Outdoor display areas located within
twenty-five (25) feet of the public right-of-way shall not exceed six (6) feet
in height.
         D.   Outdoor displays are permitted on public walks along the frontage
of the principal building subject to approval and receipt of permit from the
city. There must be an unobstructed path maintained on all public walks at a
minimum width of four (4) feet.
         E.   Lighting shall be placed and appropriately shielded as to not
adversely impact adjacent residential properties.
         F.   Outdoor display areas must be located on a hard and durable
surface.
         G.   Growing areas for nursery stock located in the front or corner
side yard are considered to meet these screening requirements.
   (d)   Drive-Thru drive aisles abutting residential districts. Any portion of
a drive-thru facility or aisle shall be screened from view when adjacent to
residential properties in order to minimize the impact of exterior site
lighting and sound amplification, headlight glare and any menu intercom
displays, from the vantage point of the residential property. Such screening
shall be approved during the site plan review process and shall consist of an
opaque masonry wall (stone, stucco or brick), a solid wood or simulated wood
screen fence, or dense evergreen hedge six (6) feet in height. Plant materials
shall be installed along any fence or wall to provide a softening effect.
   (e)   Automotive sales areas. Where automotive sales areas are permitted,
the following standards apply, unless otherwise noted within specific section
of the code defining the respective district.
      (1)   When the rear or side of an automotive sales area abuts a
residential district, the automotive sales area must be effectively screened
from view by an opaque masonry wall (stone, stucco or brick), a solid wood or
simulated wood screen fence.
      (2)   Automotive sales areas located within ten (10) feet of the public
right-of-way shall have a landscaped yard along the full length of the
perimeter facing the public right-of-way. Landscaping shall be placed along any
portion that generally faces the right-of-way to screen the parking area from
view of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. These landscape areas shall be
landscaped in the same manner as prescribed in Section
1131.05(a).
      (3)   Display areas shall not be located within five (5) feet of the
public right-of-way. Landscaping is permitted up to the public right-of-way.
      (4)   Lighting shall be placed and appropriately shielded as to not
adversely impact adjacent residential properties.
      (5)   Items displayed within the sales area shall not be placed in a
manner that will negatively impact the safe movement of pedestrian and
vehicular traffic.
   
   (f)   Ground Mounted Mechanical Equipment. Ground Mounted Mechanical
Equipment shall be screened from view from the adjoining properties and from
the public right-of-way with evergreen plant materials so that the equipment is
completely obscured from view at time of installation. (Ord. 2015-9. Passed 8-
25-15.)
1131.08 TREE PRESERVATION.
   In development planning, it is encouraged that preservation efforts are made
while laying out the location of infrastructure on the site that methods of
tree preservation be taken into account to prevent destruction of heavily
wooded areas, tree groups of over six (6) inches in caliper width, and
individual trees of over six (6) inches in caliper width. The following are
basic provisions for the preservation of trees within a site plan:
   (a)   Preservation of Trees. Preservation of all trees with a diameter of
over six (6) inches at four and one-half feet (4.5) above the ground line on
the uphill side of the tree and which are outside of the building area is
required. Such trees may not be removed from a site, and must be maintained and
protected during construction in accordance with the requirements of this Code.
The size of the tree protection area during construction shall be a circle that
meets the diameter of the drip line of the tree, or a diameter that is measured
as one (1) foot in diameter for each one (1) inch of caliper, whichever is
greater. Trees that are preserved on the site can be counted towards meeting
the mandatory requirements for landscape material quantities within the
development.
   (b)   Tree Removal. Trees that meet the specifications set forth in Section
 1131.08(a) that are currently located on the subject property shall only be
removed if approved by the Zoning Inspector and one (1) or more of the
following situations apply.
      (1)   The tree poses a hazard. In order to verify that a hazard exists,
the City may require a tree hazard assessment to be performed by a qualified
arborist.
      (2)   The tree is planted too close to an existing structure, such that
it is either damaging or has the clear potential to damage the structure.
      (3)   The roots of the tree are causing damage to sewer, plumbing or
interfere with utility lines, or is causing damage to public infrastructure
within the right-of-way or on City streets.
      (4)   The tree contains structural problems (split trunk, split crotches,
poor branch attachments), is damaged to the point that it cannot recover and
grow properly or that it will grow in a misshapen or unsightly manner that
could result in failure and fall.
      (5)   The tree is infested with an epidemic insect or disease where the
recommended control is not applicable and removal is necessary to prevent
transmission of the insect or disease to other trees. The City may require this
condition to be verified by a qualified arborist.
      (6)   The tree is within automotive driveways or within three (3) feet of
the outside edge of such driveway.
   (c)   Tree Replacement. Any tree that is removed as a result of Section
1131.08(b) must be replaced with a tree of a species included within the
generally accepted list on file with the zoning inspector, and in a location
that will grow to replace the removed tree without posing the hazards for which
the tree was removed.
      (1)   The Planning Commission may allow trees to be replaced with other
types of landscape if one (1) of the following conditions is met:
         A.   The property includes other trees that provide sufficient shade
so that additional trees are not necessary.
         B.   If a replacement tree would be out of character or form in
conjunction with an approved landscape plan.
         C.   If in the opinion of the Planning Commission there is no suitable
location on the property for a replacement tree.

from a forested area to the extent that there is a clear danger of soil erosion
and depositing of eroded soil upon adjacent land, public roads, private roads,
or into adjacent waterways. The removal of all trees from a forested area at
one time, without regard to species, quality, age or spacing shall be deemed
clear-cutting.
      (1)   Clear-cutting is prohibited, except to the extent necessary to
clear a building site, driveway, pool, tennis court, accessory building,
household sewage treatment system and right of way providing access to the site
from a dedicated public highway
      (2)   Clear-cutting is subject to approval by the Planning Commission.

1131.09 APPROVAL PROCESS FOR REQUIRED LANDSCAPING, FENCES AND WALLS.
   (a)   The location of proposed landscaping, fences or walls required to
fulfill the standards and criteria of this Chapter shall be reviewed and
approved as part of the site plan review process required by the Planning
Commission.
   (b)   However, when a fence, wall, or landscaping is proposed at a separate
time from any other development or new construction, additions or site
renovation, a fence, wall, or landscaping may be approved administratively by
the Zoning Inspector when the Zoning Inspector determines that the proposal:
      (1)   Complies with the requirements of this Chapter and other applicable
provisions in this Code;
      (2)   Is consistent with any previously approved plan; and,
      (3)   Is compatible with the current site development if there is no
approved plan.
         (Ord. 2015-9. Passed 8-25-15.)
1131.10 FLEXIBILITY.
   The standards and criteria in this Chapter establish the City's objectives
and levels of landscaping expected. However, in applying these standards during
the site plan review, the Planning Commission may exercise discretion and
flexibility with respect to the placement and arrangement of the required
elements to assure that the objectives of the district and the proposed
development or redevelopment are best satisfied.

         A.    An outdoor light fixture shall not be directed at the property
of another or unreasonably shine, glare, reflect or project light onto the
property of another.
         B.    An outdoor light fixture that is not fully shielded shall be
turned off between 9:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and sunrise, exceptwhen used
for security purposes or to illuminate private walkways, roads or driveways, in
which case such outdoor light fixture shall be equipped with a motion sensor
for activation and deactivation.
         C.    The use of flashing, rotating, or moving outdoor light fixtures
is prohibited, except for an outdoor light fixture used as holiday light
displays where each light source of such outdoor light fixture has an output of
0-260 lumens.
         D.    Light trespass shall be reduced to the maximum extent feasible,
and it is encouraged to project light from an outdoor light fixture downward
(rather than upward or horizontal) with the intention of projecting light on
the ground, and if needed to comply with this section, by using adequate
shielding of light fixtures, motion sensors, light sensors, or timers.
      (2)    New Outdoor Light Fixtures. All new outdoor light fixtures
installed after the effective date of this section and thereafter maintained on
residential property shall be fully shielded.
   (d)    Exceptions. The requirements of subsection (c)(2) for new outdoor
light fixtures do not apply to the following:
      (1)    An outdoor light fixture where each light source of such outdoor
light fixture has a maximum output of 0-260 lumens, which may be unshielded.
      (2)    An outdoor light fixture where each light source of such outdoor
light fixture has a maximum output of 261-1000 lumens, which shall be at least
partially shielded by having an opaque top and translucent sides, provided its
light source is not visible.
      (3)   An outdoor light fixture used predominantly for lighting objects
including but not limited to facades, landscaping, fountains, displays and
statuary, which shall be so installed and aimed as to inhibit light projecting
past the object being illuminated.
   (e)    In addition to the requirements set forth herein, an outdoor light
fixture shall be installed in conformity with all other applicable provisions
of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Huron, Ohio. (Ord. 2024-56. Passed 1-
28-25.)

1133.01 PURPOSE.
   Off-street parking regulations are established in order to promote the
overall vitality of the community through achieving various objectives,
including:
   (a)    Promoting the general convenience, welfare and prosperity of existing
and future developments;
   (b)   Relieving congestion on City streets by promoting alternative modes of
transportation, ensuring orderly movement of traffic, and increasing safety;
and,
   (c)   Providing adequate, but not excessive off-street parking to minimize
the negative impacts that result from large expanses of paved parking areas.
      (Ord. 2015-10. Passed 8-25-15.)
1133.02  DETERMINATION OF REQUIRED OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES.
   Off-street parking shall be provided as a condition precedent to the
occupancy or use of any building, structure or land, and at any time a
building, structure or use of land is enlarged, expanded, increased in capacity
or use, in conformance with the following provisions.
In computing the number of parking spaces required by this Ordinance, the
following shall apply:
   (a)   Where floor area is designated as the standard for determining parking
space requirements, floor area shall be the sum of the net area of all the
floors measured from the exterior faces of the building. Mechanical rooms,
stairs, restrooms, cellars, unenclosed porches, attics not used for human
occupancy are excluded from the count of total floor area.
   (b)   Where seating capacity is the standard for determining parking space
requirements, the capacity shall mean the number of seating units installed or
indicated. When fixed seats are not indicated, the capacity shall be determined
as being one (1) seat for each twenty (20) square feet of floor area of the
assembly room.
   (c)   Where employees are the standard for determining parking space
requirements, employees shall mean the maximum number of employees on any two
(2) successive shifts.
   (d)   Fractional numbers shall be increased to the next whole number.
   (e)   The parking spaces required for multiple uses shall be the sum of the
parking required for each use considered separately.
      (Ord. 2015-10. Passed 8-25-15.)
1133.03  NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES REQUIRED.
   The required number of off-street parking spaces for each facility or use
shall be determined by application of the standards noted in Schedule
 1133.03. For a use not specified in Schedule
1133.03, the Planning Commission shall apply the standard for a specified use
which the Commission determines to be most similar to the proposed use.

suitable arrangements to place bicycle parking spaces in the public right-of-
way. Bicycle parking infrastructure is only permitted to be placed within the
right-of-way upon approval of the city.
   (e)   The bicycle parking area must be convenient to building entrances and
street access, but shall not interfere with normal pedestrian and vehicle
traffic. For passive security purposes, the bike parking shall be well-lit and
clearly visible to building occupants or clearly visible from the street.
   (f)   Bicycle parking facilities must provide lockable racks, or similar
structures, where the bicycle may be locked by the user. Racks must support the
bicycle in a stable upright position. Structures that require a user-supplied
locking device must be designed to easily allow a high-security U-shaped lock
to secure the bike frame and one wheel while both wheels are still on the
frame's brackets. All racks must be securely anchored to the ground or a
structure to prevent the racks from being removed from the location.
   (g)   Shared bicycle parking facilities may be provided by multiple uses
granted access is easily accommodated, agreements / easements are documented
and the combined number of spaces meets the requirements of this section and
all other applicable sections. (Ord. 2015-10. Passed 8-25-15.)
   1133.07 ALLOWANCE FOR SHARED PARKING.
   Institutions, theaters and similar uses may make arrangements with banks,
offices, retail stores and similar uses that are not normally open, used or
operated during the same hours to share parking facilities and shall be subject
to the following provisions:
   (a)   Not more than fifty percent (50%) of the required parking spaces shall
be shared.
   (b)   Off-street parking spaces for separate uses may be provided
collectively if the aggregate number of spaces provided is not less than the
sum of the spaces required in Schedule
1133.03: Collective Parking Calculation. Schedule
1133.07(b) is applied in the following manner:
      (1)   The required number of spaces for each use is calculated according
to Schedule
1133.03.
      (2)   The required number of spaces for each use is then applied to the
percentages for each time, according to the appropriate land use category in
Schedule
1133.07(b) to determine the number of required spaces. This is done for each
time category.
      (3)   The numbers are summed for all land uses within each timeframe and
the highest sum total in a timeframe is the required number of spaces.

   (c)   In any case where the required parking spaces are collectively or
jointly provided and used, a written agreement thereby assuring their retention
for such purposes shall be properly drawn and executed by the parties
concerned, approved as to form by the City Law Director, and filed with the
application for a zoning approval.
      (Ord. 2015-10. Passed 8-25-15.)
1133.08  MODIFICATION OF MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   Whenever the parking requirements based on functions and uses, and
application of the standards specified in Schedule
1133.03 can be shown by the applicant or studies of parking demand for the use
will result in an excessive number of parking spaces for the use and that a
lesser number of spaces is appropriate and consistent with these regulations,
the Planning Commission may approve a reduction in required spaces.
(Ord. 2015-10. Passed 8-25-15.)
1133.09 PARKING MAXIMUMS.
   The following vehicle parking space maximums are applicable to all surface
parking lots for multi-family, non-residential, and mixed-use developments
within the City of Huron:
   (a)   Surface parking areas may not exceed one-hundred and twenty-five
percent (125%) of the required minimum number of vehicle parking spaces per the
regulations set forth in section
1133.03 of this ordinance.
   (b)   Existing surface parking areas that exceed the parking maximums must
come into conformance with the maximum number of parking spaces when the
following occurs:
      (1)   A new principal building is constructed on the site.
      (2)   An addition is made to an existing principal structure that would
modify the parking calculation.
      (3)   Over fifty (50%) of the total area of an existing parking lot is
reconfigured.
   (c)   When surface parking areas exceed the number of spaces permitted by
this section and are required to come into conformance, the excess spaces must
be converted into any combination of the following:
         A.   General landscaping as permitted by Chapter
1131 Landscape Requirements
         B.   Temporary bicycle parking spaces.
   (d)   The Planning Commission may grant the ability to exceed the maximum
parking requirement set forth in this section in the event that the applicant
or property owner can show that industry standards or elements specific to the
development result in the need to allow for additional parking spaces, and that
the provision of additional parking will not be detrimental to the general
welfare, safety, infrastructure, traffic congestion, or public interest of the
community.
      (Ord. 2017-9. Passed 4-25-17)
1133.10  LAND BANKED FOR FUTURE PARKING.
   Land banking land within the development site allows for designating a
portion of land on a site that would be required for parking to be held and
preserved as landscape, rather than constructed as parking. The Planning
Commission may permit land banking of up to thirty percent (30%) of the
required parking spaces, subject to the following:
   (a)   Evidence is provided by the applicant that supports the reduced
parking needs.
   (b)   The area proposed for land banking of parking spaces must be an area
suitable for parking at a future time.
   (c)   Landscaping of the land banked area must be in full compliance with
Chapter
1131 Landscape Requirements and, at a minimum, landscaped with turf or live
groundcover.
   (d)   The land banked area cannot be used for any other use and must be part
of the same zoning lot and all under the same ownership.
   (e)   As part of the site plan review process, the applicant must show the
area to be banked on the site plan and marked as "Land Banked Future Parking".
   (f)   The Planning Commission, on the basis of increased parking demand for
the use, may require the conversion of all or part of the land banked area to
off-street parking spaces. (Ord. 2015-10. Passed 8-25-15.)
1133.11  LOCATION OF REQUIRED PARKING SPACES.
   In addition to specific requirements contained in each district regulation,
the location of off-street parking facilities shall further be regulated
according to the following provisions:
   (a)   The parking spaces required for residential buildings in a residential
district shall be located on the same lot with the building or use served.
   (b)   The parking spaces required for any other building or use in a
residential district and any use in a commercial district may be located on
another properly zoned lot within 300 feet of the principal entrance and two
(2) or more owners of buildings may join together in providing the required
parking spaces. When the required parking spaces are not located on the same
lot with the building or use served, the usage of the lot or tract upon which
the parking spaces are provided shall be restricted by an instrument recorded
describing the premises for which the parking is provided and assuring the
retention of such parking so long as required by this Zoning Code.
   (c)   No parking of a motor vehicle shall be permitted on any portion of a
lot designated as an accessory structure such as a patio, porch or deck.
      (Ord. 2015-10. Passed 8-25-15.)

public property shall not be used for loading purposes nor shall vehicles be
parked on such areas during loading and unloading.
   (b)   No part of any required yard, off-street parking area, or access drive
thereto, shall be used for loading or unloading purposes.
   (c)   Off-Street Loading Space. In any district, in connection with any
building or part thereof, hereafter erected or altered which is to be occupied
by manufacturing, stores, warehouses, goods display, retail commercial,
wholesale commercial, market, hotel, hospital, mortuary, laundry, dry cleaning
or other uses requiring the receipt or distribution by truck of materials or
merchandise, there shall be provided and maintained, on the same lot with such
buildings, off-street loading space in accordance with the following schedule:
 
Net Floor Area of Building Total Number of Off-Street Loading
(Sq. Ft.)                  Spaces
Less than 10,000           0
Over 10,000 to 20,000      1

Commission.
   (e)   Each loading space shall be not less than ten feet in width, twenty-
five feet in length and fourteen feet in height.
   (f)   Such loading space may occupy all or any part of any required yard,
provided, no space shall be closer than fifty feet to any other lot located in
any R District, unless wholly within a completely enclosed building or unless
enclosed on all sides by an acceptable fence or wall or other enclosure
maintained in good condition, not less than six feet in height.
      (Ord. 2015-10. Passed 8-25-15.)
1133.13  ACCESS DRIVES IN COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS.
   In all Business Districts and Industrial Districts, there shall be adequate
provision for ingress and egress to all parking and loading spaces from public
streets and ways. Access drives shall be provided as follows:
   (a)   Each development shall be permitted one (1) entrance and one (1) exit
at the lot frontage. In the case of a corner lot, Planning Commission may grant
an additional access lane if doing so will make the flow of vehicular and
pedestrian traffic safer and more efficient.
    (b)   One (1) additional entrance and exit drive may be permitted for every
additional two hundred and fifty (250) feet of street frontage, or fraction
thereof, above the district minimum. Planning Commission may grant one (1)
additional entrance and exit drive if it is deemed imperative to efficient and
safe operations for the use on within the development.
   (c)   The width of an access drive measured at the front lot line shall not
be more than fifteen (15) feet per lane, with a maximum of one (1) entrance
lane and two (2) exit lanes. When using a two (2) lane system, the total width
shall not exceed thirty (30) feet at the property line. When using a three (3)
lane system, the total width shall not exceed forty-five feet (45) at the front
property line.
   (d)   An access point from a public street or way shall be located no closer
than twenty (20) feet to a residential district and the resulting adjacent open
area shall be properly landscaped and maintained in accordance with the
standards in Chapter
1131 Landscape Requirements. Access lanes for all commercial and industrial
uses shall not exist within property zoned residential.
   (e)   An access drive shall be located no closer than fifty (50) feet to an
intersection, unless specific circumstances on the parcel make such placement
necessary. Access drives adjacent to intersections are subject to approval by
the Planning Commission.
   (f)   Landscaped medians may be installed to separate lanes of incoming and
outgoing traffic and shall not be used in calculation of total width.
Landscaped medians shall be landscaped in accordance with parking lot island
regulations as set forth in Chapter
1131 Landscape Requirements and shall be installed in a manner as to protect
safe and efficient flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Signage may be
included within this area, but shall be placed as to not adversely affect safe
passage of traffic or site line visibility.
      (Ord. 2015-10. Passed 8-25-15.)
1133.14 NON-RESIDENTIAL JOINT USE DRIVEWAYS AND CROSS-ACCESS EASEMENTS.
   Adjacent non-residential uses that possess dedicated parking areas are
encouraged to provide joint use driveways and cross-access easements to allow
circulation between sites (See Figure
1133.14: Joint Use Driveways and Cross-Access Easements). If the site intends
to make use of a joint-use drive or cross access easement, the following
regulations must be followed:

following:
      (1)   A travel aisle and driveway width of twenty-four (24) feet to
ensure two-way travel aisles to accommodate automobiles, service vehicles and
loading vehicles.
      (2)   Bump-outs and other design features to make it visually obvious
that the abutting properties are tied together.
      (3)   A unified access and circulation plan for shared parking areas.
   (c)   Pursuant to this section, property owners who establish cross-access
easements must record an easement allowing cross-access to and from properties
served by the joint use driveways and cross-access easement.
      (Ord. 2015-10. Passed 8-25-15.)
1133.15 SINGLE-FAMILY AND TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DRIVEWAYS.
   (a)   For single-family and two-family dwellings, residential driveways that
provide access to a garage are limited in width dependent upon the designated
motor vehicle capacity of the garage in factors of twelve (12) feet per space
within the garage. In the event that a driveway exceeds twenty-four (24) feet
in width, the driveway is permitted to extend for a distance of twenty (20)
feet from the garage doors before tapering back to the maximum driveway width
of twenty-four (24) feet. For driveways extended from attached garages located
twenty-five (25) feet or less from the lot line, the driveway is permitted to
be width of attached garage with no tapering required on private property. The
apron shall then be a maximum of twenty-four (24) feet.
   (b)   Driveways must be located no closer than three (3) feet from the side
and rear lot line. However, a residential driveway may be shared by adjacent
lots and constructed on the lot line. This shared driveway location is only
allowed if agreed to by the owners of each lot. This agreement will then be
filed with the County Recorder for perpetual use.
   (c)   Residential driveways must be surfaced with Portland cement concrete,
bituminous asphalt, brick or concrete pavers placed with gaps not exceeding one
quarter inch and shall be graded and drained to prevent surface water
accumulation. Paving with pervious or semi-pervious materials, such as
permeable pavers, porous asphalt, and porous concrete is permitted, but must be
able to withstand the impact of vehicular traffic. Gravel, wood chips, and
other unfinished materials are prohibited.
   (d)   Vehicles parked on the premises of any parcel that is residentially
zoned shall be located on a designated driveway that is installed and
maintained in accordance Section
1133.16(c). Parking on front or side yards is prohibited.
(Ord. 2015-10. Passed 8-25-15.)

surfaced as follows:
      (1)   Parking lots and circulation lanes. Concrete not less than four (4)
inches in thickness, or with bituminous surface not less than three (3) inches
in thickness, consisting of one and three fourths (1 ¾) inches of compacted
#301 base course and one and one fourth (1 ¼) inches of compacted #404 surface
course, over a six (6) inch compacted aggregate base. Surfaces in areas
designated as accessible parking and/or accessible pedestrian paths shall meet
all applicable federal and state standards.
      (2)   Circulation lanes for parking lots. Concrete not less than six (6)
inches in thickness, or with bituminous surface not less than four (4) inches

and one half (2 1/2) inches of compacted #301 binder course and one and one
half (1 1/2) inches of compacted #404 surface course over a four (4) inch
compacted aggregate base or paving with semi-pervious materials that are able
to withstand vehicular traffic or other heavy-impact uses is permitted (e.g.
permeable pavers, porous asphalt, porous concrete).
      (5)   Alternative paving materials. Semi-pervious materials, such as
permeable pavers, porous asphalt, and porous concrete shall permit natural
percolation of water and be installed and maintained in accordance with
industry and manufacturer's standards and the following:
         (A)   The manufacturer's specifications are applicable to the subject
property's particular soil type and slope (gradient) so that vehicles are
supported without rutting and water percolation is achieved.
         (B)   Semi-pervious parking areas must allow storm water to percolate
into the ground at a rate sufficient to accommodate the five-year, 24-hour
storm event.

documentation of the removal of visible surface sediment accumulations, and/or
test results of infiltration rate through the pervious concrete and sub-grade
soils system.
         (D)   For non-residential uses, if only a portion of the parking area
is designated for semi-pervious materials, the area designated for semi-
pervious parking shall be located at the perimeter of the parking lot, and if
possible, remote or furthest removed from the principal building.
      (6)   Sidewalks, both public and private. Concrete not less than four (4)
inches in thickness, and four (4) feet in width on a two (2) inch stone base.
   (d)   Drainage.  All required spaces, together with driveways and other
circulation aisles, shall have adequate provision for underdrainage and for the
disposal of storm water, so that water shall not flow onto adjoining property
or adjacent sidewalks in a quantity or manner that would be detrimental
thereto, or inconvenient to persons using the sidewalk.
   (e)   Curbs. A physical barrier in the way of a concrete curb, parking
blocks, or asphalt rolled curb at least six (6) inches in height shall be
installed and maintained along the permitted of a parking or loading area that
abuts a landscaped area. Curb inlets must be placed in order to allow water
flow into the landscaped areas permitted by proper site grading.
   (f)   Marking. The location of each parking space and the location and
direction of movement along the driveways providing access thereto shall be
indicated by painting upon the surface, by raised directional signs, or by
markers or other similar measures placed in the surfacing.
   (g)   Screening.  Screening and landscaping of parking areas shall be
provided pursuant to the Chapter
1131 Landscape Requirements.
   (h)   Signs. Signs shall be provided in accordance with Chapter
1129 Signage Requirements.
   (i)   Lighting. Wherever a parking lot or garage is to be used during

illumination over the entire parking lot and access or drive aisles within the
parking area. All lights shall be shielded as to minimize glare will extend to
adjacent property.
   (j)   Maintenance. A parking lot or garage shall be maintained in a manner
to keep it as free as practicable from dust, paper and other loose particles,
and snow and ice shall be promptly removed by the operator. All adjacent
sidewalks shall be kept free from dirt, ice, sleet and snow and in a safe
condition for use by pedestrians. All signs, markers or any other methods used
to indicate direction of traffic movement and location of parking spaces shall
be maintained in a neat and legible condition. Any walls, trees and shrubbery,
as well as surfacing of the parking lot or garage, shall be maintained in good
condition throughout its use for parking purposes. All exposed concrete walls
shall be painted or finished.
      (Ord. 2015-10. Passed 8-25-15.)
1133.17 TRAILER PARKING.
   (a)   Semitrailers, hitched and unhitched, shall only be parked in
Industrial zoned districts. Short-term parking is permitted in commercial and
mixed-use districts to conduct business activities specific to the site, but is
limited to four (4) hours.
   (b)   Semitrailers not in use shall not remain on any premises for more than
seventy-six (76) hours after being loaded or unloaded.
   (c)   Trailers and pole-trailers when being parked in residential districts
are limited to being placed on a paved area of the allowable driveway as per
section
1133.15 of this section.
   (d)   Outdoor parking of any inoperable or unlicensed commercial tractor is
prohibited.
   (e)   For the purposes of this section, "commercial tractor", "pole
trailer', "semitrailer" and "trailer" shall be defined in the same manner as
set forth in Chapter
301, "Definitions" of the Traffic Code. (Ord. 2015-10. Passed 8-25-15.)
1133.18 EXCEPTIONS TO OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS IN BUSINESS DISTRICTS.
   (a)   In certain business districts, parking needs are predominantly met by
the existence of significant amounts of on and off-street public parking and,
in some areas, large private parking areas serving multiple uses. A large
number of small parking lots would be disruptive in these areas, in which safe
and pleasant conditions for pedestrians are important assets. On the
commercial-district parcels described below, the following exceptions to the
off-street parking requirements shall apply:
      (1)   Additional parking shall not be required in the event of a new use
being added within the existing footprint of an existing multi-use building.
      (2)   New uses in existing buildings with net floor areas (NFA) expanded
by 25% or more of the previously existing footprint shall be required to either
provide the required number of off-street parking spaces specified for the use
or request that the Planning Commission grant a special exception from the off-
street parking requirement for that particular use. In such case, the Planning
Commission shall not allow for a parking reduction to exceed fifty (50%) of the
required parking.
   (b)   Each Mixed Use District, as established in Chapter
1127 Mixed Use Districts, has specific off-street parking regulations due to
the unique circumstances within each district. In the event that this chapter
conflicts with the regulations set forth in Chapter
1127 Mixed Use Districts, the
1127 Mixed Use Districts chapter shall override Chapter
1133 Off-street Parking and Loading Regulations. (Ord. 2015-10. Passed 8-25-
15.)

1135.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of Huron, State of Ohio, does ordain as
follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Huron has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and
      (4)   Generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (5)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (6)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (7)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (9)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (10)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (11)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (12)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (13)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Huron as identified in Section
1135.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the City of Huron.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Erie County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Erie County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both
effective September 1, 2022.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Huron as required by Section
1135.04(c) Subdivisions and Other New Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City of Huron Planning and Zoning Department, 417
Main Street, Huron, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (h)   Interpretation. Within the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Huron, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof,
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 2022-
32. Passed 7-26-22.)
1135.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
Accessory Structure
A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and
subordinate to, the principal structure.
Appeal
A request for review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any
provision of these regulations or a request for a variance.
Base Flood
The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given
year. The base flood may also be referred to as the one percent (1%) chance
annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)
The water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum,
usually the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American
Vertical Datum of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In
Zone AO areas, the base flood elevation is the lowest adjacent natural grade
elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to 3 feet).
Basement
Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all
sides.
Breakaway wall
A wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is
intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral
loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building
or supporting foundation system.
Coastal high hazard area
An area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of
a primary frontal dune along an open coast, and any other area subject to high
velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. A coastal high hazard area
is identified on a community's FIRM by the designation of zone VE.
Conservation Easement
A legally binding document recorded with the intent to preserve land for future
generations by restricting or conditioning certain rights or uses, such as the
right to subdivide or develop the property, to protect conservation values,
such as the preservation of agricultural and forestry lands and the protection
of water quality.
Development
Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not
limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading,
paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.
Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor
See "Lowest Floor."
Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)
Issued by President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally
assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified
special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
The agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood
Insurance Program.
Fill
A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
Flood or Flooding
A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally
dry land areas from:
   (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
   (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)
Usually the initial map, produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting
approximate special flood hazard areas.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
An official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development has delineated the areas of special
flood hazard.
Flood Insurance Risk Zones
Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood
hazard in specific areas of a community. Following are the zone definitions:
   Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
base flood elevations are not determined.
   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
   Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations
are determined.
   Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
   Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   Zone V
Coastal special flood hazard area subject to a 100-year flood from velocity
hazard (wave action); base flood elevations are not determined.
   Zone VE and V1-30
Coastal special flood hazard area subject to a 100-year from velocity hazard
(wave action); base flood elevations are determined.
Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
The official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has provided flood profiles,
floodway boundaries (sometimes shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and
the water surface elevations of the base flood.
Floodproofing
Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate
or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their
contents.
Flood Protection Elevation
The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation plus two
(2) feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
Floodway
A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one-half (0.5) foot at any point within the
community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
Freeboard
A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the
purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic
effect of urbanization in a watershed.
Historic structure
Any structure that is:
   (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
   (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district; or
   (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained by
Huron's historic preservation program, which program is certified by the Ohio
Historic Preservation Office.
Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis
An analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of
Ohio, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA,
used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
Letter of Map Change (LOMC)
A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend
or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the following
categories:
   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
A comment by FEMA regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction,
affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and
thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the
effective base flood elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA)
A line shown on a Flood Insurance Rate Map to indicate the inland limit of the
one and one-half (1.5) feet breaking wave height during the base flood.
Lowest floor
The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a
structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the lowest floor" which
is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area,
provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design
requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures below the lowest
floor.
Manufactured home
A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes of these
regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes
as defined in Chapter 4781 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Mean sea level
For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations
shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
Manufactured home park
As specified in the Ohio Adm. Code 4781-12-01(K), a manufactured home park
means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for
habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority. Manufactured home park does not include any tract of land used
solely for the storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.
Moderate Wave Action Area (MoWA)
A special flood hazard area subject to the potential for breaking wave heights
of greater than or equal to one and one-half (1.5) feet, but less than three
(3) feet, where the primary source of flooding is storm surges, seiches. A MoWA
is an area within zone AE on a FIRM that is between the inland limit of zone VE
and a Limit of Moderate Wave Action, where identified. (Also known as "Coastal
A Zone").
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating
communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This
insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and
their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an
agreement between local communities and the Federal government that states if a
community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce
future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the
Federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as
a financial protection against flood loss.
New construction
Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by the City of Huron and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
"start of construction'' commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
FIRM April 3, 1978 or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures.
Person
Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership,
association, or any other entity, including state and local governments and
agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Rev. Code 111.15(A)(2) as
any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or any
court.
Recreational vehicle
A vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less
when measured at the largest horizontal projection, (3) designed to be self-
propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and (4) designed
primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters
for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
Registered Professional Architect 
A person registered to engage in the practice of architecture pursuant to Ohio
Rev. Code 4703.01 and 4703.19.
Registered Professional Engineer
A person registered as a professional engineer pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code
Chapter 4733.
Registered Professional Surveyor
A person registered as a professional surveyor pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code
Chapter 4733.
Riparian Buffer
A riparian buffer is a vegetated area (usually forested) near a stream, which
helps shade and partially protect a stream from the impact of adjacent land
uses. Riparian buffers play a key role in enhancing water quality in associated
streams, rivers, and lakes, thus providing environmental benefits.
Special Flood Hazard Area
Also known as "Areas of Special Flood Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain
subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30,
A99, or V, VE. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are
flood prone and designated from other federal state or local sources of data
including but not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water
marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a
watercourse.
Start of construction
The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of a building.
Structure
A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally above ground.
Substantial Damage
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to the 'before damaged' condition would equal or exceed fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial damage also means flood related damage sustained by a structure on
two (2) separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost of
repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds
twenty-five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
Substantial Improvement
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
   (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration
would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
SWPPP
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) is a site-specific, written
document signed by a developer that (1) identifies all of the activities and
conditions at their site that could cause water pollution, and (2) details the
steps the facility will take to prevent the discharge of any unpermitted
pollution.
Variance
A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations.
Violation
The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with
these regulations.
(Ord. 2022-32. Passed 7-26-22.)
1135.03  ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The Planning Director or
their designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement these

programs and budget request reflect consideration of flood hazards and
floodplain management; and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies
and requirements of EO 11988.
   (k)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Huron flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1135.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.    For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;

processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.    The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in riverine areas where FEMA has provided base flood
elevations but no floodway.
         D.    Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1135.03(k)(1)(A).
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the City Manager of
Huron and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/ Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Huron have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Huron's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Huron
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Huron suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City of Huron has assumed or relinquished floodplain
management regulatory authority.
   (l)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1135.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (4)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this ordinance
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
   (m)    Use of Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or Flood Insurance
Study Data.
      (1)   Zone A:  
         Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from the
preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall reasonably utilized as best available data.
         When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final food
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
      (2)   Zones AE, A1-30, AH, AO, VE, and V1-30:
         BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are not
required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an existing
effective FIS and FIRM. However,
         Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
         Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not be used
to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or until all
appeals have been resolved.
      (3)   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
1135.04(i)(2) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the
best data available.
      (4)   Zones B, C, and X:
         Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are not
required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM which
are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, AO, VE, or V1-30. Communities are
encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data to ensure that
the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
   (n)    Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
      (4)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

   (i)    Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1135.03(k)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the City Manager of Huron and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No

         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one-half (0.5) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1135.04(i)(1)(B), items (a) and (c)-(e).
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior

actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in the City of
Huron Planning and Zoning Department, 417 Main Street, Huron, Ohio.
   (b)    Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1135.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)    Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within five (5) days of the date of such notice and order,
or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or
for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)    Variances. Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a floodplain variance shall be accompanied
by the fee established by the City Council for appearances before the Board.
The fee for a floodplain variance shall be three hundred dollars ($300.00).
      (2)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1135.05(d) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)    Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)    Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Erie County Court of Common Pleas,
pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Chapter 2506.
(Ord. 2022-32. Passed 7-26-22.)

1137.01  LOTS OF RECORD.
   (a) Dwelling On Any Lot of Record.
      (1)    In any district in which dwellings are permitted, a one-family
detached dwelling may be erected, enlarged or added to on any lot of official
record at the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, irrespective of its area
or width, except as provided for in subsection (a)(2) hereof.
      (2)   If two or more lots, or combination of lots, or lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership were of record at the effective date of
this Ordinance and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirement for
lot width and area as established by this Ordinance, the land involved shall be
considered an undivided parcel for purposes of this Ordinance and no portion of
such parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet lot width and area
requirements established by this Ordinance, nor shall any division of the
parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot with width or area below the
requirements stated in this Ordinance; provided, however, that a portion of
such parcel may be sold to the owner of property abutting such parcel for the
purpose of enlarging the property of the abutting owner. In such event, the
portion of the parcel being sold to the abutting owner need not meet the lot
width and area requirements established by this Ordinance but the portion of
the parcel being retained must meet the minimum lot width and area requirements
established herein.
   (b) Yard Reduction by Zoning Inspector.
      (1)   Where there were substandard lots of record at the time of
effectiveness of this Ordinance in districts permitting residences, the depth
of the required rear yard and/or the minimum side yard width may be reduced by
up to four inches for each foot by which the lot at the effective date of this
Ordinance was less than 100 feet deep and/or less than fifty feet in width
where this is necessary to provide the minimum site for one single car garage
on the site, twelve feet wide by twenty-two feet deep.
      (2)   Where construction or enlargement of, or addition to, a one-family
detached dwelling is to be undertaken on a lot that is substandard by virtue of
lot area and/or lot width under the terms of subsection (a) hereof, and the
application of the yard requirements of the district within which it is located
results in a space available for construction that is less than the minimum
ground floor area required for a two-story dwelling (see Section
1121.06 (n)) and/or a space available for construction of the residence that is
less than twenty feet in width, the depth of the required rear yard and/or the
minimum width of each side yard may be reduced by up to four inches for each
foot by which the lot at the effective date of this Ordinance was less than 100
feet deep and/or less than fifty feet in width, in any combination of such
reductions of side and rear yards, to the point where the minimum ground floor
area and the minimum construction width of twenty feet has been attained but
not exceeded.
      (3)   Side yards, where reduced under subsection (b)(2) hereof, shall be
reduced uniformly at both sides. Side yards shall only be reduced, under both
subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) hereof, when rear yard reduction, within the
limits specified herein, cannot result in the required minimum residential
ground floor building area, or the minimum twenty-foot residential construction
width. Under no condition shall a side yard provided for under the terms of
this section, for either a residence or a garage, be less than three feet in
width, or less than five feet in the case of a side yard along a side street
lot line, and provided further that no rear yard shall be less than ten feet.
   (c)   Relief by Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (1)   Where the full application of all of the reliefs provided for in
subsections (a) and (b) hereof, still do not provide a minimum ground floor
area and/or a minimum twenty-foot construction width, the Zoning Inspector
shall so certify to the Board of Building and Zoning Appeals which will accept
such certification as proof of a clear and certain hardship on the land
warranting relief.
      (2)   Where the full application of all of the reliefs provided for in
subsections (a) and (b) hereof, still do not provide the minimum site as
specified for a single car garage, the permit for construction of the garage
shall be denied. (Ord. 2012-30. Passed 7-24-12.)
 
1137.02 HEIGHT MODIFICATIONS.
   (a)   The height limitations stipulated elsewhere in this Zoning Ordinance
shall not apply to the following:
      (1)   Barns, silos or other farm buildings or structures on farms; church
spires, belfries, cupolas and domes, monuments, water towers, fire and hose
towers, observation towers, transmission towers, windmills, chimneys,
smokestacks, flag poles, radio towers, masts and aerials; parapet walls
extending not more than four feet above the limiting height of the building.
      (2)   Places of public assembly in churches, schools and other permitted
public and semipublic buildings, provided that for each three feet by which the
height of such building exceeds the maximum height otherwise permitted in the
district, its side and rear yards shall be increased in width or depth by an
additional foot over the side and rear yards required for the highest building
otherwise permitted in the district.
      (3)   Bulkheads, elevator penthouses, water tanks, monitors and scenery
lofts, provided no linear dimension of any such structure exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the corresponding street lot line frontage; or monuments, cooling
towers, grain elevators, gas holders or other structures where the
manufacturing process requires a greater height.
   (b)   All such structures above the heights otherwise permitted in the
district shall not occupy more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the area of
the lot and shall be distant no less than fifty feet in all parts from every
lot line.
(Ord. 1990-20. Passed 11-26-90.)
1137.03 YARD MODIFICATIONS.
   (a)    Average Depth of Front Yards. The required minimum front yard depth
of any lot in any R District shall be modified to be at least equal to the
average front yard depth of lots immediately adjoining it and within the same
block front. Such modification will be made only if such average front yard
depth is not equal to the required minimum front yard depth. The modified
required minimum front yard depth of such lot shall be at least ten feet and
not exceed fifty feet. If any immediately adjoining lot is vacant, then the
front yard depth of such immediately adjoining lot will be presumed to be the
required minimum front yard depth.
   In any R District where the natural grade of a lot within the required front
yard has an average slope, normal to the front lot line at every point along
such line, of such a degree or percent of slope that it is not practicable to

of this chapter and shall issue no permit or license for any use, building or
purpose in conflict with the provisions of this chapter. Any permit or license,
issued in conflict with the provisions of this chapter shall be null and void.
   (b)   Filing Plans. Every application for a zoning certificate shall be
accompanied by plans in duplicate, drawn to scale in black line or blue print,
showing the actual shape and dimensions of the lot to be built upon or to be
changed in its use, in whole or in part; the exact location, size and height of
any building or structure to be erected or altered; in the case of a proposed

One copy of such plans shall be returned to the owner when the plans are
approved by the Zoning Inspector, together with such zoning certificate as may
be granted. All dimensions shown on these plans relating to the location and
size of the lot to be built upon shall be based on actual survey. The lot and
the location of the building thereon shall be staked out on the ground before
construction is started. In any case where the lot is not provided and is not
proposed to be provided with a public water supply and/or the disposal of
sanitary wastes by means of public sewers, the application shall be accompanied
by a certificate of approval by the Health Officer of the proposed method of
water supply and/or disposal of sanitary wastes.
   (c)   Zoning Certificate. No owner shall use or permit the use of any
structure, building or land or part thereof, hereafter created, erected,
changed, converted or enlarged in whole or in part, until a zoning certificate,
which may be a part of the building permit, is issued by the Zoning Inspector.
Such zoning certificate shall show that such building or premises or part
thereof, and the proposed use thereof, are in conformity with the provisions of
this chapter. The Zoning Inspector shall issue a zoning certificate, provided
he is satisfied that the structure, building or premises and the proposed use
thereof and the proposed methods of water supply and disposal of sanitary
wastes, conform with all applicable requirements of this chapter. The zoning

shall act upon all such applications on which he is authorized to act by the
provisions of this chapter within thirty (30) days after they are filed in full
compliance with all the applicable requirements. He shall either issue a zoning
certificate within the thirty (30) days or shall notify the applicant in
writing of his refusal of such certificate and the reasons therefor. Failure to
notify the applicant in case of such refusals within the thirty (30) days shall
entitle the applicant to a zoning certificate, unless the applicant consents to
an extension of time.
   (f)   Fees. A fee shall be charged for an original zoning certificate
applied for before the application for a building permit, where such permit is
required and issued under the Building Code (Chapter
1321). For all other zoning certificates, there shall be a fee and the charge
therefor, as referenced in the Fee Schedule.

thereto, for which no other penalty is provided, shall be fined an amount
prescribed by Council in the Fee Schedule found in the Administrative Code.
Each and every day during which such illegal location, erection, construction,
reconstruction, enlargement, change, maintenance or use continues shall be
deemed a separate offense.
   (h)   Violation; Remedy. In case any building is or is proposed to be
located, erected, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, changed, maintained or
used or any land is or is proposed to be used in violation of this chapter or
any amendment or supplement thereto, Council, the Law Director, the Zoning
Inspector or any adjacent or neighboring property owner, may in addition to
other remedies provided by law, institute appropriate action or proceedings to
prevent such unlawful location, erection, construction, reconstruction,

provisions of this chapter, may be taken by any property owner, including a
tenant, or by a governmental officer, department, board or bureau. Such
application shall be filed with the Zoning Inspector, who shall transmit same

appellant, whenever a permit is authorized by the Board.
   A decision of the Board shall become effective immediately on the date of
the final decision.
   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the Zoning Inspector certifies to the Board after notice of appeal
is filed with him, that by reason of acts stated in the certificate, a stay
would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may
be granted by the Board or by the Court of Common Pleas on application, on
notice to the Zoning Inspector, or by judicial proceedings and on due cause
shown.
   (f)   Powers. The Board of Building and Zoning Appeals shall have the
following powers:
      (1)   The Board shall have the power to hear and decide, in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter, applications, filed as hereinbefore
provided, for variances, interpretation of the Zoning Map, interpretation of
the Zoning Code or for decision upon other special questions on which the Board
is authorized by this Ordinance to pass. In considering an application, the
Board shall give due regard to the nature and conditions of all adjacent uses
and structures.
      (2)    The Board shall have the power to permit the following
nonconforming uses:
         A.    Nonconforming Uses; Substitution. The substitution of a
nonconforming use existing at the time of enactment of this chapter by another
nonconforming use, if no structural alterations except those required by law or
resolution are made, provided however, that in an R District, no change shall
be authorized by the Board to any use which is not a permitted or conditional
use in any R District and in a B District, no change shall be authorized to any
use which is not a permitted or conditional use in any B District.
         B.    Nonconforming Uses; Extension. The extension of a nonconforming
building upon the lot occupied by such building or on an adjoining lot,
provided that such lot was under the same ownership as the lot in question at
the time the use of such building became a nonconforming use, that the value of
such extension shall not exceed in all twenty-five percent (25%) of the
assessed valuation for tax purposes of the existing building devoted to a
nonconforming use, that such extension shall be within a distance of not more
than fifty (50) feet of the existing building or premises, that such extension
shall in any case by undertaken within five (5) years of the enactment of this
chapter; and provided further however, that the Board shall not authorize any
extension or enlargement which would result in violation of the provisions of
this chapter with respect to any adjoining premises, unless a structure in
question is exactly within the same footprint as the previous nonconforming
structure.
         C.    Extension of Use on Border of District. The extension of a use
or building into a more restricted district immediately adjacent thereto, but
not more than twenty-five (25) feet beyond the dividing line of the two (2)
districts, under such conditions as will safeguard development in the more
restricted district.
         D.    Temporary Structures and Uses. The temporary use of a structure
or premises in any district for a purpose or use that does not conform to the
regulations prescribed elsewhere in this chapter for the district in which it
is located, provided that such use is of a temporary nature and does not
involve the erection of a substantial structure. A zoning certificate for such
use shall be granted in the form of a temporary and revocable permit for not
more than a twelve-month period, subject to such conditions as will safeguard
the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare.
   (g)    Interpretation of Zoning Map. Where the street or lot layout actually
on the ground or as recorded differs from the street and lot lines as shown on
the Zoning Map, the Board after notice to the owners of the property and after
public hearing, shall interpret the Map in such a way as to carry out the
intent and purpose of this chapter. In case of any question as to the location
of any boundary line between zoning districts, a request for interpretation of
the Zoning Map may be made to the Board and a determination shall be made by
the Board.
   (h)    Administrative Review; Appeals. The Board shall have the power to
hear and decide appeals filed as hereinbefore provided, where it is alleged by
the appellant that there is error in any order, requirement, decision,
determination, grant or refusal made by the Building Official, Planning
Director, or other administrative official in the enforcement and/or
interpretation of the provisions of this chapter.
   (i)    Variances. The Board shall have the power to authorize variance from
the terms, provisions or requirements of this chapter upon appeal in a specific
case filed as hereinbefore provided:
      (1)    Where by reason of the size, shape, physical and/or topographic
characteristics of the specific parcel of land on the effective date of this
chapter, or other extraordinary physical situation or condition of this
property or of the land immediately adjoining the property in question, the
literal enforcement of the provisions or requirements of this chapter would
result in denial of all economic use of the land, or
      (2)    Where a developer of land files an application with the Planning
Commission to subdivide, recombine or divide a parcel of land and one or more
of the lots intended to be created thereby do not meet the requirements of the
chapter and, by reason of unique physical conditions relative to this specific
property, a literal enforcement of the provisions or requirements of this
chapter will be physically impossible or economically destructive of all
economic use of the land.
      (3)    Conditions in Granting a Variance.  
         A.    In authorizing a variance, the Board may attach thereto such
conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed
structure or use as it may deem necessary in the interest of the furtherance of
the purposes of the chapter and in the public interest. In authorizing a
variance with attached conditions, the Board shall require such evidence,
guarantee, bond, surety or other security as it may deem necessary to enforce
compliance with the conditions attached to such variance.
         B.    The variance granted shall be in direct response to the unique
problem presented. That is, a problem in application of side yards shall be met
with variance of side yard requirements, not by variance in permitted land use.
         C.    The variance granted shall be the least variance required to
respond to the problem.
         D.    The variance granted shall not be a substantial detriment to
adjacent property or impair the purposes of this chapter or the public
interest.
      (4)    Certifications in Variance. Upon granting a variance under one of
the two conditions specified in subsection (j) hereof, the Board shall certify
to the Zoning Inspector and to the Planning Commission:
         A.    That the conditions of either subsection (1) A or B hereof
permitting the granting of the variance, have been met.
         B.    The manner in which the conditions specified in subsections (3)
B through D hereof have been met, and
         C.    The special conditions of the variance, if any, as authorized in
subsection (3)A hereof.
   (j)    Board May Reverse Orders. In exercising its power, the Board may in
conformity with the provisions of statute and of this chapter, reverse or
affirm wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of
the office from whom the appeal is taken.
   (k)    Expiration. If a use is established under a use permit or variance
and the use is discontinued for any reason for a period of one (1) year, the
permit becomes void and the use may not be resumed unless granted by the Board
of Building and Zoning Appeals. For area variances tied to specific projects, a
variance granted is only valid for one (1) year, which is fulfilled with the
commencement of construction within one (1) year of issuance. Should the one-
year time limit lapse, applicants must reapply for a hearing before the Board
of Building and Zoning Appeals or the Zoning Certificate becomes null and void.
(Ord. 2023-53. Passed 1-23-24.)
1139.05 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   (a)   Purpose. Planning Commission may grant conditional use permits for
certain uses which are not permitted by right under the Zoning Ordinance.
Conditional uses include those uses which have some special impact or
uniqueness such that their effects on the public health, safety, convenience,
comfort, prosperity and general welfare in the City of Huron cannot be
determined in advance of the particular use being proposed for a particular
location. At that time, a review of the location, design, configuration and
impact is conducted by assessing the proposed use against fixed standards. The
review considers the proposal in terms of existing zoning and land use in the
vicinity of the use, public and private developments which may be adversely
affected by the proposed use, the impacts of the proposed use at the particular
location for which it is proposed on the public health, safety, convenience,
comfort, prosperity and general welfare, and whether and to what extent all
appropriate feasible steps have been taken by the permit applicant to minimize
or mitigate any adverse impacts of the proposed use. This review determines
whether the proposed use shall be permitted or permitted conditionally by the
Board.
   (b)   Applicability. Any use which is permitted as a conditional use by this
Zoning Ordinance shall comply with this section.
   (c)   Procedures.

or classifications of property as shown on the Zoning Map shall be submitted to
the Commission (with a copy provided to the Clerk of Council), which Commission
shall be allowed a reasonable time, not less than thirty days, for submitting
its recommendations on a proposed amendment or reclassification to Council.
Each such application shall be verified by at least one of the owners or
lessees of property within the area proposed to be reclassified, attesting to
the truth and correctness of all facts and information presented with the
applications. Applications for amendments initiated by the Commission itself
shall be accompanied by its own motion pertaining to such proposed amendment.

proposed amendment or reclassification to Council, the Commission may hold a
public hearing thereon, notice of which shall be given by one publication in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City at least ten (10) days before the
date of such hearing. The notice shall state the place and time at which the
proposed amendment to the Ordinance, including text and maps, may be examined.

land as listed on the tax duplicate, written notice of the hearing shall be
mailed by the Clerk of Council by first-class mail, at least twenty (20) days
before the date of the public hearing, to the owners of property within and
contiguous to and directly across the street from such parcel or parcels, to
the address of such owners appearing on the County Auditor's current tax list
or the Treasurer's mailing list. The failure of delivery of such notice shall
not invalidate any such ordinance.
      (3)   Recommendation to Council. Following their review, the Commission
may recommend that the application be granted as requested, or it may recommend
a modification of the zoning amendment requested in the application, or it may
recommend that the application not be granted. These recommendations shall then
be certified to Council.
      (4)   Council hearing. After receiving from the Commission the
certification of such recommendations on the proposed content-based amendment
or amendments, and before adoption of such amendment, Council shall hold a
public hearing thereon, at least thirty (30) days' notice of the time and place
of which shall be given by one publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City. The 30-day notice shall be waived for minor formatting

the recommendations of the Commission thereon, Council shall consider such
recommendations and vote on the passage of the proposed amendment to the text
of the Ordinance or the Zoning Map. Council may overrule the recommendations of
the Commission by a majority vote of the full membership of Council.

1141.04 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION RELATING TO DESIGN REVIEW.
   The Planning Commission may adopt rules and regulations governing its
procedures and transactions relating to and consistent with this Chapter. The
Planning Commission shall meet as required to carry out the review of
applications for projects, or in the case of a sign, a request for a permit, as
required by this Chapter and such other related work as may be accepted through
request of Council or undertaken on its own motion. Meetings shall be held in
accordance with the rules of the Planning Commission as required when there are
applications to be considered and not less than once annually. Special meetings
may be held at the call of the chairperson of the Planning Commission.
   Within the City limits, the Planning Commission shall review any proposed
new construction, alterations to property, and signage as herein defined. The

thereon.
   In reviewing proposed new construction, alterations, and signage, the
Planning Commission shall at a minimum use as evaluative criteria, the
following:
   (a)   Materials shall be appropriate for the use of the structures,
weathering, and the relationship to other materials, including those used on
adjacent structures.
   (b)   Colors and textures shall be appropriate for the size and scale of the
structures, weathering, and the relationship to other colors and textures,
including those used on adjacent structures.
   (c)   Architectural details and ornamentation shall be meaningful to the
overall design and appropriate for the size and scale of the structures,
weathering, and the relationship to other architectural details and
ornamentation, including those used on adjacent structures. Detailing such as
trim, moldings, bands of contrasting siding or brick, and varying textures of
concrete or stone are encouraged as part of an overall design which is in-scale
with the building and carefully related to other elements.
   (d)   Mechanical equipment shall be of appropriate size and scale in
relation to rooftop appearance, sidewall openings, sound levels, smoke
detectors and other nuisances. The location, color, size, type, and screening
or mechanical equipment, whether on the roof, walls, or ground, shall be
designed to be concealed, and/or to be compatible with or attractively
complement the other elements of the structures and site improvements.
   (e)   Windows, doors, and other openings shall be so located on the facades,
and be of such dimensions, as are appropriate for the style, scale, and
orientation of the building and in a pattern which contributes to a balanced
facade appearance. Customer entrances should be accentuated. Decorative
elements, caps, brickwork, and trim are encouraged around windows and doors to
add interest to the overall design.
   (f)   Architectural styles similar to or compatible with existing historical
buildings adjacent to or across the street from the structure shall be
encouraged. Compatibility and complementary elements among existing and
proposed new structures shall be encouraged in all locations.
   (g)   Scale of new construction should be similar to that of the majority of
surrounding buildings.
   (h)   Varied roof lines, roof details and features such as dormers, turrets,
eave breaks, and overhangs are encouraged in new construction as a means to
break up the mass of large buildings and to provide visual interest.
   (i)   Wall mounted signs shall be designed to fit within and complement the
architectural forms, colors, and textures of the building, shall fit within any
architectural space specifically designed for signs, and shall not cover
architectural features. Signs located as part of a series of signs (such as in
a shopping center), shall be designed with compatibility of location, size,
shape, style, material, illumination, and color with other signs in the series.
   (j)   Sign Design Sign colors shall complement the color of the building
façade on which the sign is mounted, letters and symbols shall be in scale with
the building and its features. Excessive information and clutter are
discouraged.
   (k)   Freestanding signs shall be designed to fit within and complement the
characteristics of the site, building, and wall signs in terms of color,
materials, texture, and scale.
   (l)   Alterations and additions to existing buildings shall be compatible in
scale, material, color, placement, and character with the existing buildings.
   (m)   Distinctive architectural features of existing buildings should not be
altered or removed unless replaced with features of similar composition,
texture, color, design, and other characteristics. Restoration of historic
features and building characteristics shall be encouraged.
   (n)   Side and rear walls shall be so designed as to relate to and be
compatible with the front or main entry wall and overall design of the
building, although they may be less detailed and articulated.
   (o)   Site features such as fences, walls, and signs compatible in color,
texture, scale, materials, and other characteristics with the main building
shall be encouraged.
      (Ord. 2021-36. Passed 10-26-21.)
1141.05  TRIGGERING MECHANISM FOR DESIGN REVIEW.

case of a sign, for a permit, an application will be forwarded to them. All
property owners of structures within the City limits must receive Planning
Commission design approval prior to building permit issuance.

1301.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective March 1, 2005, and as identified
and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 118 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.
      (OBC 101.3)
1301.03 SCOPE.
   The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall apply to the construction,
alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and
occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and demolition of every building or
structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings or
structures. As provided in Section 3791.04(B) of the Ohio Revised Code, no
plans or specifications shall be approved or inspection approval given unless
the building represented by those plans or specifications would, if
constructed, repaired, erected or equipped according to those plans or
specifications, comply with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code and
any rules adopted by the Board.
   An owner may exceed the requirements of the Ohio Building Code in compliance
with Section 102.7 of the Ohio Building Code.
   Exceptions:
   (a)   Detached one-, and two-, and three-family dwellings and structures
incidental to those dwellings which are not constructed as industrialized units
shall comply with local residential codes, if any, adopted by the authority
having jurisdiction. This exception does not include the energy provisions
required in “Chapter 13, Energy Efficiency” of the OBC (see Sections 3781.06,
3781.181 and 3781.182 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (b)   Buildings owned by and used for a function of the United States
Government;

trade; for the purposes of this section, a building or structure is not
considered used in the business of retail trade if fifty percent or more of the
gross income received from sales of products in the building or structure by
the owner or operator is from sales of products produced or raised in a normal
crop year on farms owned or operated by the seller. (See Sections 3781.06 and
3781.061 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (d)   Agricultural labor camps;
   (e)   Type A or Type B family day-care homes;

1315.08 CONSTRUCTION SITE CONSERVATION PLAN.
     In order to control storm water damage and sediment pollution of water
resources, wetlands, riparian areas, other natural areas, and public and
private lands, the owner of each development area shall be responsible for
developing a comprehensive Construction Site Conservation Plan. This plan will
address storm water management (volume and peak rate of runoff), soil erosion,

controls appropriate for each construction operation covered by these
regulations, and the operator must implement the planned controls in a timely
manner. The plan and BMPs used to satisfy the conditions of these regulations
shall meet the standards and specifications in the current edition of the Ohio
Rain Water and Land Development manual. The plan must make use of the practices
that preserve the existing natural condition to the Maximum Extent Practicable.
The plan shall identify the subcontractors engaged in activities that could
impact storm water runoff. The Construction Site Conservation Plan shall
contain signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that
they have been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in
complying with the Construction Site Conservation Plan.
   (a)   Development Sites Under One (1) Acre in Size: Individual development
sites that are larger than 8,000 square feet and smaller than one (1) acre

            (Ord. 2022-17. Passed 3-22-22.)
1315.09 EASEMENTS.
     Future access to floodplains, flood control facilities, runoff drainage
ditches and channels,
runoff storage facilities, storm sewers and other drainage ways and structures,
as required by the Community Engineer, shall be secured by means of easements.
   (a)   The easements shall be recorded in the name of the Community and, in
single-family residential developments, the homeowners association.
   (b)   Such easements shall be not less than twenty-five (25) feet in width,
in addition to the width of the ditch, channel, or other facility it is to
serve. Access easements of this type shall be provided on one (1) side of the
flood control or storm drainage ditch, channel, or similar type facility.
   (c)   Access along the initial drainage system shall be by means of
easements. Such easements shall be not less than twenty-five (25) feet in
width, with a minimum ten (10) foot width on either side of the centerline.

      (g)    The easements shall be restricted against the planting within said
easement of trees, shrubbery or plantings with woody growth characteristics,
and against the construction therein of buildings, accessory buildings, fences,
walls or any other obstructions to the free flow of storm water and the
movement of inspectors and maintenance equipment and also restricted against
the changing of final grade from that described by the grading plan.
      (Ord. 2022-17. Passed 3-22-22.)
1315.10 MAINTENANCE.
      Any portion of the permanent drainage and soil erosion systems, including
on-site and off-site storage facilities that are constructed by the owner, will
be continuously maintained into perpetuity.
   (a)   Maintenance plans shall be provided by the permittee to both the
Community Engineer and the post- construction operator of the BMP (including
homeowner associations) upon completion of construction activities and prior to
the Community Engineer giving final approval for the completed construction.
     (b)    Single Family and Multi-family Residential Developments: A
Homeowners' Association shall be created and placed in title of the affected
lands and shall be continuously responsible for post-construction maintenance
and inspections into perpetuity unless such maintenance and inspections become
officially accepted by the Community.
      (c)    Apartments, Commercial and Industrial Developments: The plans will
clearly state that the owner of the property shall be continuously responsible
for post-construction maintenance and inspections into perpetuity unless the
Community officially accepts such maintenance and inspections.
     (d)    Maintenance Design: All temporary and permanent soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be designed and constructed to minimize
maintenance requirements. Multi-use facilities incorporating assets such as
aesthetics and recreation may be incorporated into the design of the drainage
facilities. All permanent drainage, soil erosion, sediment control, water
quality management systems and BMPs, including on-site and off-site structures
and vegetation that are constructed or planted, must be inspected and
maintained into perpetuity by the responsible party designated in the plans.
Inspections and maintenance will be incorporated periodically throughout the
year to ensure that the facilities are properly operational.
      (e)    Perpetual Maintenance Inspections: One (1) inspection with a
written report will be performed each year. The written report will be given to
the Community Engineer by May 1 of each and every year after the Best
Management Practice (BMP) has been completed.
      (1)   Structures that require a permit from the Ohio Division of Water: A
written and stamped report from a professional engineer on the status of all
structural BMPs that require a permit from the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources (ODNR) Division of Water. This applies to all BMPs that require a
permit either at the time of construction or fall under the jurisdiction of the
ODNR Division of Water at any time after construction is completed.
            (2)    Easements: A written report from an inspector on the status
of all storm water management easements for each project shall be submitted to
the Community Engineer by May 1 of each year into perpetuity. These reports
will document if restricted plantings, fences and structures are on the
easement and will identify the location of the noted easement restriction
violations.
            (3)    Best Management Practices (BMPs) that do not have a high
risk for loss of life, bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure
related to imminent failure as determined by the Community Engineer: A written
and stamped report from a professional engineer, landscape architect or
Certified Professional In Erosion and Sediment Control (CPESC) on the status of
permanent soil erosion, sediment control, water quality management systems and
the status of the related easements shall be submitted to the Community
Engineer by May 1 of each year into perpetuity.
            (4)    BMPs that have a potential loss of Life: A written and
stamped report covering the status of all BMPs that have a potential for loss
of life, bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure will be
prepared by a professional engineer or other individual possessing a valid
state license that authorizes them to design the same type of BMP for
construction.
         (Ord. 2022-17. Passed 3-22-22.)
1315.11 MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the owner or
person responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and
practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the following
standards.
   (a)    The plan shall include measures that control the flow of runoff from
disturbed areas so as to prevent soil erosion from occurring.
     (b)    Structural Practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from areas remaining disturbed for more than fourteen (14) days.
      (c)    Sediment Barriers: Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
intercepted by Silt Fence or Diversions to protect adjacent properties and
water resources from sediment. Where intended to provide sediment control, Silt
Fence shall be placed on a level contour. The relationship between the maximum
drainage areas to Silt Fence for a particular slope is shown in the table below
(placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend the size of the
drainage area).
Table 1: Silt Fence Applicability
 
Maximum drainage area (in acres) to Range of slope for a particular drainage
area
100 linear feet of Silt Fence (in percent)
0.5                           <2%
0.25                          >2% but <20%
0.125                         >20% but <50%
      This does not preclude the use of other sediment barriers designed to
control sheet flow runoff. The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier
shall not exceed the design capacity for that sediment barrier. Straw Bale
Barriers are not acceptable.
      (d)    Storm Water Diversion Practices: Storm water diversion practices
shall be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Such practices, which include Swales, Dikes or Berms, Pipe Slope
Drains and Diversions, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten (10)
acres. Storm water diversion practices alone are not considered a sediment
control practice unless those are used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
      (e)    All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff
in order to be considered functional.
      (f)    Clearing and Grubbing will be done in two (2) or more phases. The
first phase will include only those locations necessary to install the
perimeter soil erosion, sediment and storm water control BMPs. After the
perimeter controls are in place and functioning, the remaining phase(s) of
clearing and grubbing may continue.
      (g)    Timing of Sediment Trapping Practices: Sediment control practices
shall be functional throughout all phases of up slope earth disturbing
activity. Settling facilities, perimeter controls and other practices intended
to trap sediment shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7)
days from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up
slope development area is permanently restabilized. As construction progresses
and the topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or
existing controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (h)    Stabilization of Denuded Areas: Disturbed areas must be stabilized
as specified in the tables below, or according to the Ohio EPA NPDES Storm
Water Permit Rules, whichever is most restrictive:
Table 2: Permanent Stabilization
 
 
Area requiring permanent stabilization  Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any areas that will lie dormant for one Within seven days of the most recent

                                        coverage for the individual lot(s).
Disturbed areas that will be idle over  Prior to the onset of winter weather
winter
      (i)    Sediment Settling Ponds: A sediment settling pond is required for
any one of the following conditions:
                Concentrated storm water runoff (e.g., storm sewer or ditch);
                   Runoff from drainage areas, which exceed the design capacity
of silt fence or other sediment barriers;
                   Runoff from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity
of inlet protection;
                   Runoff from common drainage locations with ten (10) or more
acres of disturbed land.
      Alternative controls can be used if the owner can show, in writing, that
the Ohio EPA approved the use of alternatives that the owner demonstrated to be
equivalent in effectiveness to a sediment settling pond.
            (1)    Where storm sewer drainage areas include ten (10) or more
acres disturbed at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment settling pond
must be provided until final stabilization of the site. In single-family
residential construction, final stabilization is after the houses are built and
permanent landscaping is done.
                  A.    It is recommended that for drainage locations of less
than ten (10) acres, smaller sediment settling basins and/or sediment traps be
used.
            (2)    Each facility's storage capacity shall be no less than 1800
cubic feet of dewatering zone area per acre of total contributing drainage area
and 1000 cubic feet per disturbed acre of sediment storage zone area. The
storage volume will be measured from the bottom of the basin to the top of the
primary (principle) spillway.
            (3)    Permanent storm water management ponds that are designed to
trap sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow
release of sediment-laden water. The draw down time must be at least forty-
eight (48) hours, or meet the criteria in the Ohio Rainwater and Land
Development manual whichever is most stringent.
            (4)    The design configuration between inlet(s) and the outlet of
settling ponds must provide at least two units of length for each one unit of
width (> 2:1 length to width ratio); a length to width ratio of 4:1 is
recommended.
           (5)    The depth of the dewatering zone of the sediment settling
pond must be less than or equal to five (5) feet.
            (6)    Sediment must be removed from the sediment settling ponds
when the design capacity has been reduced by forty percent (40%).
            (7)    Public safety, especially as it relates to children, must be
considered in the design. Alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design.
            (8)    Temporary sediment settling ponds will not be constructed in
any stream channel.
      (j)    Storm Sewer Inlet Protection:
            (1)    All storm sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter
the storm sewer, unless the storm drain system drains to a Sediment Settling
Pond and is exempted in writing by the Community Engineer. In areas where
construction will be ongoing, such as subdivisions, the storm sewer protection
shall be maintained until all up slope areas reach final stabilization, as
determined by the Community Engineer.
            (2)    All inlets receiving runoff from drainage areas of one or
more acres will require a sediment settling pond.
            (3)    At the end of this period the site owner shall hydraulically
clean the storm sewers to the satisfaction of the Community Engineer. All
sediments shall be removed from the system and shall not be flushed downstream.
      (k)    Storm Sewer and Other Drainage Outlets: All storm sewers, footer
drains, roof gutter drains and all other drains will be outletted at the bottom
of the slope. The slope below the outlet will be able to control the water
being drained through the storm sewer or other drains without causing erosion
of the stream or channel banks or channel bottom or other areas that the water
is outletted on.
      (l)    Working Near, Or Crossing Streams and Wetlands:
            (1)    Construction vehicles shall avoid water resources, wetlands,
riparian areas, and their setbacks. If construction vehicles must cross these
areas during construction, an approved temporary crossing shall be constructed.
Streams, including intermittent streams with a defined bed and banks, shall be
restabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed, interrupted, or
stopped. Erodible materials will not be used in making stream crossings.
           (2)     No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped
or placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may slough,
slip, or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is
authorized by the approving authority and, when applicable, the US Army Corps
Of Engineers and Ohio EPA, for such purposes as, but not limited to,
constructing bridges, culverts, and erosion or sediment control structures.
            (3)    If construction activities disturb areas adjacent to
streams, structural practices shall be designed and implemented on site to
protect the adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment runoff.
            (4)    No temporary or permanent sediment controls will be
constructed in a stream channel.
            (5)    Streams and wetland setbacks required by the community will
be implemented. As a minimum a setback of twenty-five (25) feet, as measured
from the ordinary high water mark of the surface water, will be maintained in
its natural state as a permanent buffer.
      (m)    Construction Entrance:
            (1)    Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto
public roads, or surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls.
            (2)    Stone with geotextile construction entrance(s) shall be
implemented as required by the Community Engineer and the Ohio EPA. These will
be planned and installed according to the requirements in the most recent
edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual.
            (3)    Where soil is transported onto a public road surface, the
roads shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or more frequently,
in order to ensure public safety. Soil shall be removed from paved surfaces by
shoveling or sweeping. Street washing shall be allowed only after shoveling or
sweeping has removed most of the sediment and street sewer inlet protection is
properly installed unless end of sewer sediment ponds exist and are properly
functioning.
            (4)    Erodible material ramps in streets will not be used to
enable equipment to cross curbs. Non-erosive materials (e.g. wood and stone)
can be used.
   (n)    Unstable Soils: 
            (1)    Unstable soils will be as determined by the local county
Soil Survey or by a detailed soils report.
            (2)    The Community Engineer may require detailed soil reports
when deemed necessary.
            (3)    Unstable soils prone to slipping or land sliding shall not
be graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
performed in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's
recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems.
      (o)    Cut And Fill Slopes: Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage. Consideration
shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope
drainage area, groundwater conditions and slope stabilization. The minimum
final unreinforced soil slopes will have a horizontal to vertical ratio of 2:1
(the horizontal will be two (2) times the vertical).
     (p)    Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels: Outfalls and constructed or
modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow from the planned post-development frequency storm without
eroding. The planned post-construction velocity and flow shall include the
entire contributing watershed. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at
discharge locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-
erosive velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural
physical and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and
protected.
      (q)    Establishment of Permanent Vegetation: A permanent vegetative
cover shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently
stabilized. Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until
ground cover is achieved which, in the opinion of the Community Engineer, has
eighty percent (80%) vegetative density over the entire disturbed area and
provides adequate cover, and is mature enough to satisfactorily control soil
erosion and survive adverse weather conditions.
      (r)    Disposition of Temporary Practices: All temporary soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be disposed of immediately after final site
stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer
needed, unless otherwise required by the Community Engineer. Trapped sediment
shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion. The Construction
Maintenance Guarantee shall not be released by the Community until all
temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices that are no longer needed
have been removed, properly disposed of and any trapped sediment has been
stabilized.
      (s)    Underground Utility Construction: The construction of underground
utility lines, pipes, etc. shall be subject to the following criteria:
            (1)    Trenches shall remain open for no more than five (5) days.
            (2)    There shall be no turbid discharges to surface waters
resulting from dewatering activities. If trench or ground water contains
sediment, it must pass through a sediment settling pond or other equally
effective sediment control device, prior to being discharged from the
construction site or to waters of the state.
            (3)    When discharging clean ground water care must be taken to
ensure that it does not become pollutant laden by crossing over disturbed soils
or other pollutant sources.
      (t)    Inspections:
            (1)    If inspections or other information indicates a control has
been used inappropriately or incorrectly or it has failed, it must be replaced
or modified for the site conditions.
            (2)    The owner of the development area shall have the site
inspected for soil erosion, sediment control and other environmental concerns
every seven (7) calendar days, and within twenty-four (24) hours of a one-half
(0.5) inch or greater rainfall event until the Community Engineer certifies the
site as being stable. The Community Engineer certification does not relieve the
permittee from meeting the Ohio EPA NPDES inspection requirements.
            (3)    The inspection frequency may be reduced to at least once
every month if the entire site is temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely
due to weather conditions (e.g., the site is covered with snow, ice, or the
ground is frozen.) A waiver of inspection requirements is available until one
month before thawing conditions are expected to result in a discharge if all of
the following conditions are met: the project is located in an area where
frozen conditions are anticipated to continue for extended periods of time
(i.e., more than one month); land disturbance activities have been suspended;
and the beginning and ending dates of the waiver period are documented. Once a
definable area has been fully stabilized, you may mark this on your plans and
no further inspection requirements apply to that portion of the site.
            (4)    Following each inspection, a checklist must be completed and
signed by the qualified inspection personnel representative. At a minimum, the
inspection report must include: i) the inspection date; ii) names, titles, and
qualifications of personnel making the inspection; iii) weather information for
the period since the last inspection including the timing, duration, and depth
of any storms; iv) weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of the inspection; v) location(s) of discharges of
sediment or other pollutants from the site; vi) location(s) of BMPs that need
to be maintained; vii) location(s) of BMPs that failed to operate as designed
or proved inadequate for a particular location; viii) location(s) where
additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the time of the inspection;
and, ix) corrective action required including any necessary changes to the
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan and implementation dates.
            (5)    The inspection log will include the date and actions taken
to correct problems noted in past inspection logs.
            (6)    If the construction site is subject to Ohio EPA's National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for construction
activity, a copy of all of the required inspection sheets will be submitted to
the Community Engineer within three (3) working days of the date that the
inspection was conducted.
            (7)    Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that
are exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the
potential for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
            (8)    Erosion and sediment controls identified in the Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan shall be observed to ensure that they are operating
correctly.
            (9)    Discharge locations shall be inspected to ascertain whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving waters.
            (10)    Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be
inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
            (11)    Sensitive areas including riparian and wetland setbacks
shall be observed to ensure that they remain well marked and undisturbed.
            (12)    If the inspection reveals that a control practice is in
need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of sediment settling ponds,
it must be repaired or maintained within three (3) days of the inspection.
Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of
the inspection.
            (13)    If any inspection reveals that a control practice fails to
perform its intended function and that another, more appropriate control
practice is required, the Construction Site Conservation Plan must be amended
and the new control practice must be installed within ten (10) days of the
inspection.
      (14)    If the inspection reveals that a control practice has not been
implemented in the time required by this chapter it must be installed within
ten (10) days from the date of inspection.
           (15)    If the inspection reveals that a planned control practice is
not needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the
control practice is not needed.
      (u)    Control of Materials and Debris: Site management practices shall
be implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris
from entering the Community's and state's water resources or wetlands. These
practices shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
            (1)    A covered dumpster shall be made available for the proper
disposal of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster, drywall,
grout, gypsum and etc. A second covered dumpster will be provided for the
proper disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes.
            (2)    The washing of excess concrete material into a street, catch
basin, or other public facility or natural resource shall not occur. A
designated area for concrete washouts shall be made available and used for all
concrete washouts.
            (3)    All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a marked storage
area. A dike shall be constructed around this storage area with a minimum
capacity equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the volume of the largest
container in the storage area. All additional requirements of the local fire
authority must be followed. If the fuel tanks have a self-contained "dike," the
plug will be kept in the "dike" tank at all times.
            (4)    Any toxic or hazardous wastes and/or contaminated soils must
be disposed of according to all applicable environmental laws and statutes.
Local health districts and Ohio EPA can provide guidance on these issues.
           (5)    On a site with a prior industrial land use or a site that is
contaminated with gasoline, fuel oil, hydrocarbon-based chemicals or other Ohio
EPA regulated contaminates, the storm water is considered wastewater. A permit
from Ohio EPA is required to address these sites.
           (6)    Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on
solid waste landfill sites.
            (7)    Paint, paint washing liquids, excess paints and other paint
wastes are considered solid wastes and shall be disposed of in accordance with
applicable state regulations. Appropriate handling of these wastes shall occur
at the site so as to prevent the discharge of these wastes into surface or
ground waters.
                  A.    Water based paint washing liquids and small quantities
of excess water based paints may be disposed of by flushing down a connected
sanitary sewer but may not be disposed of in an on- lot disposal system.
                  B.    All other paints, paint thinners, and paint cleaning
materials will be disposed of in the site's hazardous waste disposal dumpster.
            (8)    Restroom facilities will be provided for site workers at all
times that workers are present on the site and during all phases of the
construction.
            (9)    All required permits from appropriate federal, state, or
local agencies are required to develop land with a previous industrial or
commercial use or another use that may have led to soil contamination by a
regulated pollutant.
     (v)    Pre-winter Stabilization: If the development area will, or is
planned to remain, active through the winter months, the owner of the
development area shall hold a Pre-Winter Stabilization Meeting. The meeting
will be held before October 1. The owner shall invite the operator, developer,
engineer, contractor, Community Engineer and anyone else requested by the
Community Engineer to the meeting.
      (w)    Storm Water Basins:
            (1)    Pool Geometry: The minimum length-to-width ratio for the
pond is 3:1 (the length will be three (3) times the width).
            (2)    Riser in Embankment: The riser shall be located within the
embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will be by
manholes.
            (3)    Water Drains: Each retention basin shall have a drainpipe
that can completely drain the pond. The drain shall have an elbow within the
pond to prevent sediment deposition from plugging the drain.
            (4)    Adjustable Gate Valves: Both the storm water management and
water quality basin drains shall have adjustable gate valves. Valves shall be
located inside the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be
operated in a safe and convenient manner. During the annual inspections the
valves shall be fully opened and closed at least once, and the certifying
official shall attest to this on the inspection form. To prevent vandalism, the
handwheel shall be chained to a ringbolt or manhole step.
            (5)    Principal Spillway: Each principal spillway shall be
designed in accordance with the NRCS standards and specifications for the
office serving the county. Each principal spillway shall have the capacity to
pass the 100-year design storm flow. The inlet or riser size for the pipe drops
shall be designed so that the flow through the structure goes from weir flow
control to pipe flow control without going into orifice control in the riser.
The crest elevation of the primary spillway shall be no less than one foot
below the emergency spillway crest. Premium joint pipe is required and a
removable trash rack shall be installed at each location. Anti-seep collars
shall be provided for all pipe conduits through an embankment.
            (6)    Emergency Spillway: An emergency spillway shall be provided
on each storm water management basin. Emergency spillways shall convey flood
flows safely past the embankment, and shall be designed in accordance with NRCS
standards and specifications for the office serving the local county. Emergency
spillways shall have a 100-year design storm capacity unless exempted in
writing by the Community Engineer.
            (7)    Embankments: Each dam embankment shall be designed in
accordance with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving
the county that the project is located in. Anti-seep collars shall be provided
for all pipe conduits through an embankment.
            (8)    Safety Features: 
                  A.    The primary spillway opening shall not permit access to
the public and other non-maintenance personnel.
                  B.    The perimeter of all water pool areas that are deeper
than three (3) feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:
                     1.    A safety bench, with a maximum slope of three
percent (3%), which extends outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This
bench will be a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet wide to provide for the safety
of individuals and maintenance vehicles that are adjacent to the water pool.
The safety bench may be landscaped, without the use of structures, to prevent
access to the water pool.
                     2.     Side slopes between the safety bench and the
aquatic bench shall not be steeper than 3:1 (3 feet horizontal for every 1 foot
vertical).
                     3.    An aquatic bench that extends inward from the
shoreline far enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of fifteen
(15) inches below the normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be
landscaped to prevent access to the deeper water pool.
                     4.    Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the
permanent water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (2 feet horizontal for
every 1 foot vertical).
                     5.    The contours of the pond will be designed and
managed to eliminate drop-offs and other hazards.
                     6.    Side slopes getting to the pond shall not exceed 3:
1 and shall terminate on a safety bench.
                     7.    Soil erosion and sediment control practices used to
satisfy these standards shall meet the standards and specifications in the
current edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, NRCS Field
Office Technical Guide for the local county or the Ohio EPA, whichever is most
stringent.
      (x)    These standards are general guidelines and shall not limit the
right of the Community Engineer to impose at any time additional, more
stringent requirements, nor shall the standards limit the right of the
Community Engineer to waive, in writing, individual requirements.
      (y)    Soil limitations shall be determined by using the current edition
of the county soil survey written by the NRCS, USDA.
     (z)    Methods for controlling increases in storm water runoff peaks and
volumes may include, but are not limited to:
            (1)    Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction; for
example, grassed road ditches rather than paved street gutters where practical,
discharging roof water to vegetated areas, or grass and rock- lined drainage
channels.
            (2)    Grading and use of grade control structures to provide a
level of control in flow paths and stream gradients.
            (3)    Induced infiltration of increased storm water runoff into
soil, where practical; for example, constructing special infiltration areas
where soils are suitable, retaining topsoil for all areas to be vegetated, or
providing good infiltration areas with proper emergency overflow facilities.
            (4)    Provisions for detention and retention, for example,
permanent retention ponds and lakes, dry detention basins, and subsurface
detention tanks.
         (Ord. 2022-17. Passed 3-22-22.)
1315.12 STREAM CHANNEL, FLOODPLAIN EROSION DESIGN CRITERIA, AND INFILTRATION
POST CONSTRUCTION PRACTICES WITH MAXIMUM DRAIN TIMES.
      (a)    Runoff Rate: The peak runoff rate from the development area shall
not be greater after development than it was before development. The applicant
shall provide calculations proving no increase in the runoff rates from the one
(1), two (2), five (5), ten (10), twenty-five (25), fifty (50) and one hundred
(100) year storms.
      
   (b)    Runoff Volume: Increases in the runoff volume shall be offset by
further restricting runoff rates. Based on the increase in runoff volume, the
applicant shall determine the critical storm for the development area. The
runoff rate from the critical storm shall be restricted to the one (1) year
pre- development storm runoff rate. The critical storm shall be calculated as
follows:
            (1)    Determine the total volume of runoff from a one-year
frequency, twenty-four hour storm, occurring on the development area before and
after development.
            (2)    From the volumes in paragraph (1) determine the percent of
increase in volume of runoff due to development according to the equation (Q
after divided by the Q before) X 100 and, using this percentage, select the
critical storm from this table:
 
Table 4: Critical Storm Selection
The Percentage Increase in Volume Of Runoff is:
Equal To Or Greater Than And Less Than The 24-hour "Critical Storm" For
                                       Discharge Will Be
0                        10            1 Year
10                       20            2 Years
20                       50            5 Years
50                       100           10 Years
100                      250           25 Years
250                      500           50 Years
500                      ---           100 Years
   
      (c)    Detention Or Retention Basin Exemption For Redevelopment Or For
Expansion Of Existing Facilities:
            (1)    For any development regulated by this ordinance, the
construction of a detention or retention basin may not be required for the
development if the post-development peak discharge for a 100 year frequency
twenty-four (24) hour storm increases the existing peak discharge by one (1)
cubic foot per second or less using the TR-55 method of calculation or other
method approved by the Community Engineer. The Community Engineer can waive
this requirement if existing storm sewers and drainage structures can safely
handle the expected increase in flow.
            (2)    Only one (1) exemption will be allowed per parcel. Any
subsequent expansion must provide for detention or retention and must include
the previously exempted area.
   (d)    Where the Community Engineer determines that site constraints exist
in a manner that compromises the intent of this ordinance to improve the
management of storm water runoff as established in this section, practical
alternatives may be used to result in an improvement of water quality and/or a
reduction of storm water runoff. Such alternatives must be in keeping with the
intent and likely cost of those measures that would otherwise be required to
meet the objectives of this section. When possible, all practical alternatives
shall be implemented within the drainage area of the proposed development
project. Practical alternatives can include, but are not limited to:
            (1)    Fees shall be paid in an amount specified by the Community
Engineer. These fees shall be applied by the Community to storm water
management practices that reduce existing storm water runoff.
            (2)    Implementation of off-site storm water management practices.
            (3)    Watershed or stream restoration.
            (4)    Retrofitting of an existing storm water management practice.
            (5)    Other practices approved by the Community Engineer in
keeping with the intent of this section.

Infiltration Trench 3                  48 hours
Permeable Pavement - Infiltration 3    48 hours
Underground Storage - Infiltration 3,4 48 hours
1.   Bioretention soil media shall have a permeability of approximately 1 - 4
in/hr. Meeting the soil media specifications in the Rainwater and Land
Development manual is considered complaint with this requirement. Bioretention
cells must have underdrains unless in-situ condition allow for the WQv (surface
ponding) plus the bioretention soil (to a depth of 24 inches) to drain
completely within 48 hours.
2.   Infiltrating practices with the WQv stored aboveground (bioretention,
infiltration basin) shall fully drain the WQv within 24 hours to minimize
nuisance effects to standing water and to promote vigorous communities of
appropriate vegetation.
3.   Subsurface practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv (infiltration
trench, permeable pavement with infiltration, underground storage with
infiltration) shall empty within 48 hours to recover storage for subsequent
storm events.
4.   Underground storage systems with infiltration must have adequate
pretreatment of suspended sediments included in the design and documented in
the SWP3 in order to minimize clogging of the infiltrating surface.
Pretreatment shall concentrate sediment in a location where it can be readily
removed. Examples include media filters situated upstream of the storage or
other suitable alternative approved by Ohio EPA. For infiltrating underground
systems, pretreatment shall be eighty percent (80%) effective at capturing
total suspended solids according to the testing protocol established in the
Alternative Post-Construction BMP Testing Protocol.

permanent storm water, soil erosion, sediment, or other wastes control or water
quality practice prior to the approval of the final plat where, in the
Community Engineer's judgment, such proper construction or installation is not
immediately necessary for the protection of the public health and safety; and
where the prior installation or construction of such improvement would
constitute an undue hardship on the owner because in the case of new vegetation
or weather conditions, or because in the case of concrete, building
construction could cause cracking and excessive wear and tear on new
structures. In such event, the Community shall require a Security Bond, Escrow
Account, Certified Check or Cash to guarantee that such deferred improvements
will be properly constructed or installed within an agreed specified time, but
not to exceed six (6) months after the filing of such final plat.
   (b)    The owner will provide a maintenance guarantee for all permanent
improvements, and soil erosion, wastes controls, and water quality practices.
   (c)   The Community shall require a Security Bond, Escrow Account, Certified
Check or Cash to guarantee that the planned temporary and permanent soil
erosion, sediment, and other wastes controls and water quality practices will
be constructed and removed in a timely manner, as determined by the Community
Engineer.
            (1)   The Guarantee. The guarantee of both performance and
maintenance will be in the form of a Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified
Check or Cash. The Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash will
be used by the Community to complete any guaranteed construction or removal of
improvements or temporary and permanent soil erosion, sediment, and other
wastes control practices that are not adequately completed, maintained or
removed by the owner in a timely manner, as determined by the Community
Engineer. The Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash will be in
the total amount of both the performance guarantee and the maintenance
guarantee. Ohio municipalities and counties may require performance bonds or
other guarantees for water management improvement as stated in the Ohio R.C.
Chapter 711.101.
                  A.   Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash
shall be deposited with the Community prior to review by the Community Engineer
and/or its consultants to cover professional services of the Community
Engineer, Building Commissioner, Zoning Inspector and/or other experts required
by the Community Engineer, Community Council, Mayor or Review Boards.
                 B.    No soil disturbing activities shall be permitted until a
Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash has been posted to the
satisfaction of the Community Engineer sufficient for the Community to perform
the obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner or person responsible
for the development area as stated in this regulation, and to allow all work to
be performed as needed in the event that the owner or person responsible for
the development area fails to comply with the provisions of this regulation.
The Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash shall be released
only after all work required by this regulation has been completed to the

maintained for a period of not less than two (2) years after final acceptance
of the storm water, soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control practices
in an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the estimate approved by the
Community Engineer, of the construction and, where necessary, removal of such
practices.
            (4)    Time Extension. The Community Engineer may extend for cause
the time allowed for the installation of the improvements for which the
performance guarantee has been provided with the receipt of a written request
from the owner.
            (5)    Completion. Upon completion of the construction of
improvements or temporary and/or permanent, soil erosion, sediment, and other
wastes control practices and the removal of the temporary soil erosion,
sediment, and other wastes control practices for which the performance
guarantee has been provided the owner shall notify the Community Engineer of
this fact.
            (6)    Inspection. The Community will not release the Security
Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash guarantee until the Community
Engineer has inspected the site to ensure that the guaranteed item(s) have been
completed and/or removed.
            (7)    Slow Release Devices. Performance and maintenance guarantees
will be maintained on the temporary sediment removal slow release devices
installed in detention and retention basins until the entire site has reached
final soil stabilization. Final stabilization in single-family residential
developments is when ninety percent (90%) of the homes are constructed with
their lawns completely installed and any remaining unbuilt lots having been
permanently stabilized with a uniform ground cover at a growth density of
eighty percent (80%) or better.

   (e)   To meet the Post-Construction requirements of this regulation, the
Post-Construction Water Quality Plan must contain a description of the Post-
Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) that will be installed during
construction for the site and the rationale for their selection. The rationale
must address the anticipated impacts on the channel and floodplain morphology,
hydrology, and water quality.
   (f)   Structural post-construction BMPs cannot be installed within a State

depending on the size of the development sites as well as any additional
information required by the community engineer:
      (1)   Development Sites Smaller than Five Acres: A development site that
will disturb one (1) or more, but less than five (5) acres of land and is not a
part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five or
more acres of land shall identify:
         A.   Storm Water Issues: A statement as to how the decreased storm

prior to the start of construction.
         F.   BMPs: Best Management Practices used in the Post-Construction
Water Quality Plan may include but are not limited to:
            1.   Permanent Storm Water Detention ponds that provide extended
detention of the water volume.
            2.   Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and natural
depressions
            3.   Onsite infiltration of runoff
            4.   Sequential systems that combine several practices
            5.   Permanent conservation easements, preferably with the easement
being held by a third party with no vested interest in ever seeing the property
developed
            6.   Natural Channel Design for drainage ways
            7.   Bioengineering in drainage ways

rationale utilized to select the BMPs used to control pollution and to maintain
and protect water quality.
      (2)   Development Sites 5 Acres or Larger: A development site that
disturbs five (5) or more acres of land or will disturb less than five (5)
acres, but is a part of a larger common plan of development or sale, which will
disturb five (5) or more acres of land shall identify:
         A.   Storm Water Detention: The Post-Construction BMP(s) chosen must
be able to detain storm water runoff for protection of the stream channels,
stream erosion control, and improved water quality.
         B.   Structural BMPs: Structural (designed) Post-Construction storm
water treatment practices shall be incorporated into the permanent drainage
system for the site.
         C.   Properly Sized BMPs: The BMP(s) chosen must be sized to treat the
water quality volume (WQv) and ensure compliance with Ohio's Water Quality
Standards in OAC Chapter 3745- 1. The WQv shall be equivalent to the volume of
runoff from a 0.75-inch rainfall and shall be determined according to the
following equation:
            1.   WQv = C * P * A / 12 where: WQv = water quality volume in
acre-feet C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1 inch
(either using Table 1 or the following formula: C=0.858i - 0.78i2 + 0.774i +
0.04 where i=fraction of post-construction impervious area) P = 0.75 inch
precipitation depth A = area draining into the BMP in acres.
Table 1 Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (> dwellings/acre)        0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (< 4 dwellings/acre)       0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  1.2
         D.   Where the land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should
be calculated using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing
drainage area to the storm water treatment structure is Low Density
Residential, 30% is High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff
coefficient is calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3) + (0.3)(0.5) + (0.1)(0.2) =
0.35.
         E.   An additional volume equal to 20 percent of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the BMP for sediment storage and/or reduced infiltration
capacity. The BMPs will be designed according to the methodology included in
the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, ODOT Post-Construction storm
water standards, or other manual that is acceptable to Ohio EPA. .
         F.   The BMPs listed in Table 2 below shall be considered standard
BMPs approved for general use. However, communities with a regulated MS4 may
limit the use of some of these BMPs. BMPs shall be designed such that the drain
time is long enough to provide treatment, but short enough to provide storage
available for successive rainfall events and avoid the creation of nuisance
conditions. The outlet structure for the post-construction BMP must not
discharge more than the first half of the WQv in less than one-third of the
drain time.

   ** Provide both a permanent pool and an EDv above the permanent pool, each
sized at 0.75 WQv + Extended detention shall be provided for the full WQv above
the permanent water pool.
   ^ The WQv shall completely infiltrate within 48 hours so there is no
standing or residual water in the BMP.
   # Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv
in a pool and 75% in marshes. The EDv above the permanent pool must be equal to
the WQv.
         G.   The owner may request approval from the Community Engineer to use
alternative structural Post-Construction BMPs if the owner can demonstrate, in
a way that is acceptable to Ohio EPA rules and regulations, that the
alternative BMPs are equivalent in effectiveness to those listed in Table 2
above. The use of alternative or vender supplied Post-Construction BMPs should
be limited to redevelopment projects where justification is provided that the
traditional BMPs in Table 2 are technically and economically infeasible.
         H.   Construction activities shall be exempt from this condition if it
can be demonstrated that the WQv is provided within an existing structural
Post-Construction BMP that is part of a larger common plan of development or
sale or if structural Post-Construction BMPs are addressed in a regional or
local storm water management plan. A municipally operated regional storm water
BMP can be used as a post-construction BMP provided that the BMP can detain the
WQv from the entire drainage area and release it over a 24 hour period upon
written permission from the Community Engineer.
         I.   For redevelopment projects (i.e., developments on previously
developed property), Post-Construction practices shall either ensure a 20
percent net reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at
least 20 percent of the WQv, or a combination of the two. Where projects are a
combination of new development and redevelopment, the total WQv that must be
treated shall be calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the
new development at 100 per cent WQv and redevelopment at 20 percent WQv.

clearly state that the owner of the property shall be continuously responsible
for Post-Construction maintenance and inspections into perpetuity unless such
maintenance and inspections become officially accepted by the Community.
   (f)   Maintenance Design: Low maintenance requirements are a priority in the
design and construction of all facilities. Multi-use facilities incorporating
assets such as aesthetics and recreation may be incorporated into the design of
the drainage facilities. All permanent drainage, soil erosion, sediment
control, water quality management systems and BMPs, including on-site and off-
site structures and vegetation that are constructed or planted, must be
inspected and maintained into perpetuity by the responsible party designated in
the plans and the requirements of this ordinance. Inspections and maintenance
will be incorporated periodically throughout the year to ensure that the
facilities are properly operational.
   (g)   Perpetual Maintenance Inspections: One (1) inspection with a written
report will be performed each year. The written report will be given to the
Community Engineer by May 1 of each and every year after the Best Management
Practice (BMP) has been completed.
      (1)   Structures that require a permit from the Ohio Division of Water: A
written and stamped report from a professional engineer on the status of all
structural BMPs that require a permit from the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources (ODNR) Division of Water. This applies to all BMPs that require a
permit either at the time of construction or fall under the jurisdiction of
ODNR Division of Water at any time after construction is completed.
      (2)   Easements: A written report from an inspector on the status of all
storm water management easements for each project shall be submitted to the
Community Engineer by May 1 of each year into perpetuity. These reports will
document if restricted plantings, fences and structures are on the easement and
will identify the location of the noted easement restriction violations.

soil erosion, sediment control, water quality management systems and the status
of the related easements shall be submitted to the Community Engineer by May 1
of each year into perpetuity.
      (4)   BMPs that have a potential loss of Life: A written and stamped
report covering the status of all BMPs that have a potential for loss of life,
bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure will be prepared by a
professional engineer or other individual possessing a valid state license that
authorizes them to design the same type of BMP for construction.
         (Ord. 2013-41. Passed 9-23-14.)
1317.12  POST-CONSTRUCTION MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   In order to control pollution of water resources, the owner or person
responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and
practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the following
standards.
   (a)   Standards and Specifications: Post-Construction runoff practices used
to satisfy these standards shall meet the standards and specifications in the
current edition of the Rainwater and Land Development manual, NRCS Field Office
Technical Guide for the local county, or the Ohio EPA, which ever is most
stringent. The construction of new roads and roadway improvement projects by
public entities shall implement Post-Construction BMPs in compliance with the
current version of the Ohio Department of Transportation's Location and Design
Manual, Volume Two: Drainage Design that has been accepted by Ohio EPA.
   (b)   Water Quality Basins:
      (1)   Pool Geometry: The minimum length-to-width ratio for the pond is 3:
1 (the length will be three (3) times the width).
      (2)   Riser in Embankment: The riser shall be located within the
embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will be by
manholes.
      (3)   Water Drains: Each retention basin shall have a drainpipe that can
completely drain the pond. The drain shall have an elbow within the pond to
prevent sediment deposition from plugging the drain.
      (4)   Adjustable Gate Valves: Both the Water Quality and the Storm Water
Management Basin drains shall have adjustable gate valves. Valves shall be
located inside of the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be
operated in a safe and convenient manner. During the annual inspections the
valves shall be fully opened and closed at least once, and the certifying
official shall attest to this on the inspection form. To prevent vandalism, the
handwheel shall be chained to a ringbolt or manhole step.
      (5)   Principal Spillway: Each principal spillway shall be designed in
accordance with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) standards and
specifications for the office serving the local county. Each principal spillway
shall have the capacity to pass the 100 year design storm flows. The inlet or
riser size for the pipe drops shall be designed so that the flow through the
structure goes from weir flow control to pipe flow control without going into
orifice control in the riser. The crest elevation of the primary spillway shall
be no less than one foot below the emergency spillway crest. Premium joint pipe
is required and a removable trash rack shall be installed at each location.
Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all pipe conduits through an
embankment.
      (6)   Emergency Spillway: An emergency spillway shall be provided on each
Water Quality and Storm Water Management basin. Emergency spillways shall
convey flood flows safely past the embankment, and shall be designed in
accordance with NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the
local county. Emergency spillways shall have a 100-year design storm capacity
unless exempted in writing by the Community Engineer.
      (7)   Embankments: Each dam embankment shall be designed in accordance
with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the county
that the project is located in. Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all
pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (8)   Safety Features:
         A.   The primary spillway opening shall not permit access to the
public and other non-maintenance personnel.
         B.   The perimeter of all water pool areas that are deeper than three
(3) feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:
            1.   A safety bench, with a maximum slope of 3%, which extends
outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a minimum of 25
feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and maintenance vehicles
that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench may be landscaped,
without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water pool.
            2.   Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than 3:1 (3 feet horizontal for every 1 foot vertical).
            3.   An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of 15 inches below the
normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped to prevent
access to the deeper water pool. The aquatic bench may also be incorporated
into the Post-Construction Water Quality Plan.
            4.   Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (2 feet horizontal for every 1 foot
vertical).
            5.   The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards. Side slopes getting to the pond shall
not exceed 3:1 and shall terminate on a safety bench.
      (9)   Water Quality Basin: If a Water Quality Basin is needed and cannot
be incorporated into an existing or planned Detention or Retention Basin then a
separate Water Quality Basin will need to be planned, designed, constructed and
maintained into perpetuity.
      (10)   Water Quality Basins will not be constructed in any permanent or
intermittent stream channel.
      (11)   Flexibility: These standards are general guidelines and shall not
limit the right of the Community Engineer to impose at any time additional and/
or more stringent requirements nor shall the standards limit the right of the
Community Engineer to waive, in writing, individual requirements.
      (12)   If the Community Engineer waives, in writing, individual
requirements the owner will provide the Community Engineer with the information
and documentation required to assure Ohio EPA that the waived requirement will
not degrade water quality.
         (Ord. 2013-41. Passed 9-24-13.)
1317.13 REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.
   Sites that have been previously developed where no Post-Construction BMPs
were installed shall either ensure a 20 percent net reduction of the site
impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20 percent of the WQv, or a
combination of the two. A one-for-one credit towards the 20 percent net
reduction of impervious area can be obtained through the use of pervious
pavement and/or green roofs. Where projects are a combination of new
development and redevelopment, the total WQv that must be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with new development at 100
percent and redevelopment at 20 percent WQv.
(Ord. 2013-41. Passed 9-24-13.)
1317.14  ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   Where the Community Engineer determines that site constraints exist in a
manner that compromises the intent of this ordinance to improve the management
of storm water runoff as established in this ordinance, practical alternatives
may be used to result in an improvement of water quality and/or a reduction of
storm water runoff. Such alternatives must be in keeping with the intent and
likely cost of those measures that would otherwise be required to meet the
objectives of this section. All practical alternatives shall be implemented
within the drainage area of the proposed development project unless
specifically authorized in writing by the community engineer.
   (a)   Implementation of Off-site Storm Water Management Practices: The use
of any off-site Post- Construction BMPs requires written approval from Ohio EPA
and this approval must be received prior to design approval and/or issuance of
any building permits. Practical alternatives to be considered include:
      (1)   Retrofitting of an existing storm water management practice.
      (2)   Watershed or stream restoration.
      (3)   Fees paid in an amount specified by the Community Engineer. The
Community shall apply these fees to storm water management practices that
improve the existing water quality.
   (b)   Use of Alternative Post-Construction BMPs: Permitees must supply
written approval from Ohio EPA to use Post-Construction BMPs that have been
demonstrated to be equivalent to the effectiveness of those listed in Table 2
above. Approval from Ohio EPA must be received prior to design approval and/or
issuance of any building permits.
   (c)   Other practices approved by the Community Engineer in keeping with the
intent of this section. (Ord. 2013-41. Passed 9-24-13.)

1317.17 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE GUARANTEE. 
   All permanent storm water, soil erosion, sediment control and water quality
practices not specifically waived by the Community shall be constructed prior
to the granting of the Final Plat Approval. Upon the request of the owner, the
Community may defer the construction or installation of a permanent storm
water, soil erosion, sediment control or water quality practice prior to the
approval of the final plat where, in the Community Engineer's judgment, such
proper construction or installation is not immediately necessary for the
protection of the public health and safety; and where the prior installation or
construction of such improvement would constitute an undue hardship on the
owner because in the case of new vegetation or weather conditions, or because
in the case of concrete, building construction could cause cracking and
excessive wear and tear on new structures. In such event, the Community shall
require a Security Bond, Escrow Account, Certified Check or Cash to guarantee
that such deferred improvements will be properly constructed or installed
within an agreed specified time, but not to exceed six (6) months after the
filing of such final plat. The owner will provide a maintenance guarantee for
all permanent improvements, soil erosion, and sediment control and water
quality practices.
   The Community shall require a Security Bond, Escrow Account, Certified Check
or Cash to guarantee that the planned temporary and permanent soil erosion,
sediment control and water quality practices will be constructed and removed in
a timely manner, as determined by the Community Engineer.
   (a)   The Guarantee: The guarantee of both performance and maintenance will
be in the form of a Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash. The
Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash will be used by the
Community to complete any guaranteed construction or removal of improvements or
temporary and permanent soil erosion, sediment control and water quality
practices that are not adequately completed, maintained or removed by the owner
in a timely manner, as determined by the Community Engineer. The Security Bond,
Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash will be in the total amount of both the
performance guarantee and the maintenance guarantee. Ohio municipalities and
counties may require performance bonds or other guarantees for water management
improvement as stated in the ORC Chapter 711.101.
      (1)   Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash shall be
deposited with the Community prior to review by the Community Engineer and/or
its consultants to cover professional services of the Community Engineer,
Building Commissioner, Zoning Inspector and/or other experts required by the
Community Engineer, Community Council, Mayor or Review Boards.
      (2)   No soil disturbing activities shall be permitted until a Security
Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash has been posted to the
satisfaction of the Community Engineer sufficient for the Community to perform
the obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner or person responsible
for the development area as stated in this regulation, and to allow all work to
be performed as needed in the event that the owner or person responsible for
the development area fails to comply with the provisions of this regulation.
The Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash shall be released
only after all work required by this regulation has been completed to the
satisfaction of the Community Engineer and all permit and inspection fees
required by these regulations have been paid in full.

for a period of not less than (two) 2 years after final acceptance of the storm
water, soil erosion, sediment control, and water quality practices in an amount
equal to 20% of the estimate approved by the Community Engineer, of the
construction and, where necessary, removal of such practices.
   (d)   Time Extension: The Community Engineer may extend the time allowed for
the installation of the improvements for which the performance guarantee has
been provided with the receipt of a written request from the owner.
   (e)   Completion: Upon completion of the construction of improvements or
temporary and/or permanent, soil erosion, sediment control, and water quality
practices and the removal of the temporary soil erosion, sediment control, and
water quality practices for which the performance guarantee has been provided
the owner shall notify the Community Engineer of this fact.
   (f)   Inspection: The Community will not release the Security Bond, Escrow
Account, Verified Check or Cash guarantee until the Community Engineer has
inspected the site to ensure that the guaranteed item(s) have been completed
and/or removed.
   (g)   Release: The Construction Maintenance Guarantee shall not be released
by the Community until all temporary soil erosion and sediment control
practices that are no longer needed have been removed, properly disposed of and
any trapped sediment has been stabilized.

   (a)    Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file within
360 days of the alleged violation with the Fair Housing Board a complaint in
writing, sworn to or affirmed which shall state the name and address of the
person alleged to have committed the violation complained of and the
particulars thereof, and such other information as may be required by the
Board. The Board may also corroborate or initiate complaints on the basis of
testing carried out by its staff or volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)    Upon the filing of a complaint the executive secretary of the Board
shall make such investigation as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and
issues. If the executive secretary determines that there are reasonable grounds
to believe a violation has occurred, he shall attempt to conciliate the matter
by methods of initial conference and persuasion with all interested parties and
such representatives as the parties may choose to assist them. Conciliation
conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done during such initial
conferences shall be made public by the Board or any member of the Board or its
staff unless the parties agree hereto in writing.
   (c)    The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced
to writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the
parties, which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not
constitute an admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent
agreements shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its chairman.
   (d)    The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Commission or Ohio Civil Rights Commission in any investigation
under this section.
   (e)    If the executive secretary determines that the complaint lacks
reasonable grounds upon which to base a violation of this Title Nine, he shall
so inform the Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint
or order such further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the
Board shall not dismiss such complaint without first affording the complainant
an opportunity to appear before the Board.
   (f)   If the executive secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a
violation of this Title Nine, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties
have in good faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal
conciliation agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a
complaint is not susceptible of conciliation, he shall notify the Board
immediately and the Board shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to
determine whether a violation of this chapter has been committed. The Board
shall serve upon the respondent a statement of charges and a summons and shall
serve upon all interested parties a notice of the time and place of hearing.
The respondent or his authorized counsel may file such statements with the
Board prior to the hearing date as it deems necessary in support of its
position. The hearing shall be opened to the public, except that the respondent
may request in writing a private hearing; the determination of such request
shall be discretionary with the Board. The hearing shall be held not less than
fifteen days after service of the statement of charges and summons. The summons
so issued must be signed by two members of the Board and the issuance of such
summons shall require the attendance of named persons and the production of
relevant documents and records. The failure to comply with a summons shall
constitute a violation of this Title Nine. The interested parties may, at their
option, appear before the Board in person or by duly authorized representative
and may have the assistance of an attorney. The parties may present testimony
and evidence, and the right to cross examine witnesses shall be preserved. All
testimony and evidence shall be given under oath or by affirmation. The
executive secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing, which record shall
be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon request by any
principal party to the proceeding. The Board shall furnish such party a copy of
the hearing record, if any, at such cost as the Board deems appropriate.
   (g)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board determines upon the
preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has violated
this Title Nine, the Board shall, after consultation with the Law Director in
executive session, state its findings to and cause the Law Director to prepare
and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person complained
against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take such
affirmative action as will effectuate the purposes of this Title Nine, with
notice that if the Board determines that the person complained against has not
after fifteen calendar days following service of the Board's order complied
with the order, the Board will recertify the matter to the Law Director for
enforcement.
   (h)    Upon recertification to the Law Director for enforcement, he shall
seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Fair
Housing Board of the City before a court of competent jurisdiction. In any such
proceeding where the court determines that there has been a violation of this
Title Nine, the court shall award compensatory damages and, where appropriate,
punitive damages, along with attorney fees. The court may also order such other
relief as it deems necessary or appropriate.
   (i)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained
against has not violated this Title Nine, the Board shall state and publish its
findings and issue its order dismissing the complaint.
