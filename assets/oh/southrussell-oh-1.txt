phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether by
legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.
(ORC 1.42)

            (ORC 1.44)
      (2)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from
a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in the concluding
month as the day of the month from which the computation is begun, unless there
are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be performed, is
closed to the public for the entire day which constitutes the last day for
doing such act or before its usual closing time on such day, then such act may
be performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal

legal holiday.

notice shall mean such time only as may be necessary for the prompt performance
of such duty or compliance with such notice.

   (f)   Exceptions. The rules of construction shall not apply to any law which

subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
202.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance. (ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;

liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
202.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
202.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
202.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
202.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. (ORC 1.50)
202.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

(Ord. 2008-14. Passed 3-10-08; Ord. 2022-69. Passed 8-8-22.)
230.04 EXPENDITURES BY DEPARTMENT HEADS WITHOUT PURCHASE ORDERS.
   All department heads (Fiscal Officer, Chief of Police, Street Commissioner,
Building Inspector) are hereby authorized to make expenditures for purchases of
supplies, goods, services and other items on behalf of the Village without the
need for issuance of a purchase order prior to payment when such expenditure
for any one item does not exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).
(Ord. 1985-7. Passed 1-14-85.)
230.05 ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to assist Village personnel
with requisitioning, purchasing, receiving, and paying for goods and services.
This section provides purchasing objectives and policies, as well as the
procedure to be followed in performing the major and minor purchasing
functions.
   (b)   Purchasing Considerations. The purpose of a Purchase Order Requisition
system is to inform the Village of the needs of a department and allow the
Fiscal Officer the ability to confirm the availability of funds. It is the
responsibility of the department head to anticipate the needs of the
department, as much in advance as possible so as not to create a situation
whereby items need to be purchased on an emergency basis.
   (c)   Any department that wishes to make a purchase against an unencumbered
balance of a fund must properly prepare a Purchase Order Requisition in
complete detail (except for items bought under a blanket purchase order or
under $1,500). The Purchase Order date must precede the invoice date,
preferably the date of order. The Purchase Order format may be in paper format
or electronic if approved by the Fiscal Officer. An example of a Purchase Order
Requisition Form is incorporated herein as Appendix A. This form can be changed
and updated upon the needs of the Village.
   (d)   Purchase Order Requisition Processing:
      (1)   Each department is responsible of entering their own Purchase Order
Requisition Form.
      (2)   Each department head or designee must approve or deny all Purchase
Order Requisitions.
      (3)   The Purchase Order Requisition Form is then forwarded to the Fiscal
Officer for review in order to confirm there is sufficient funds in the budget
line item.
      (4)   All requisitions exceeding the line item appropriation will
automatically be denied.
      (5)   If the expense was not discussed and approved by Council in the
initial annual appropriations process and exceeds $3,000, Council must approve
the Purchase Order by motion in an open meeting prior to a Purchase Order
approval.
      (6)   Once the Fiscal Officer can certify the money has been properly
appropriated, he/she will issue and certify a Purchase Order.
      (7)   Once approved three copies of the Purchase Orders are generated.
Two copies are returned to the originating department for their records and
distribution to the vendor, and one remains with the Fiscal Officer.
      (8)   Only after the department head receives a completed, signed
Purchase Order is the purchase authorized. The department head must give the
Purchase Order number to the vendor when making a purchase so it is on the
invoice and the Fiscal Officer will know what Purchase Order to apply to the
invoice.
   (e)   Blanket Purchase Order Processing.
      (1)   Blanket purchase orders may be issued by the Fiscal Officer to
cover the purchasing of goods or services over a given period of time or for a
specific good or service. All departments will be able to make purchases under
these blanket orders.
      (2)   All invoices that are mailed directly to a department after
receiving goods or services must be must signed and dated by the department
head verifying that the goods and services were received.
      (3)   Following verification by the department head the invoice must be
forwarded to the Fiscal Officer for confirmation that invoice is covered by a
blanket purchase order and for payment processing.
   (f)   Emergency Purchases.
      (1)   Emergency purchases are those defined as purchases necessary to
support the safety, security, health and welfare of the citizens of the
Village.
      (2)   If goods or services need to be obtained immediately for an
emergency, an Emergency Purchase Order may be obtained.
      (3)   An emergency Purchase Order Requisition Form (marked as
"EMERGENCY") is given to the Fiscal Officer for immediate approval.
      (4)   Any emergency purchase over $3,000 must have the approval of a
member of the Finance Committee or designee.
      (5)   Upon receipt of approval of the Emergency Purchase Order the order
may be placed.
      (6)   The Purchase Order must be approved by Council at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.
   (g)   Department heads are authorized to pay for goods and services
necessary for the normal operation of the Village without Council approval so
long as the expense will be covered by the department's annual approved budget
and does not have a negative impact on the operations of the department. All
Village purchases up to $1,500 can be authorized by the department head without
explicit approval from Council so long as the purchase can be made without
further appropriations to the department's budget. This section is to be read
in conjunction with Purchase Order process and requirements outlined above. No
purchase can be made without complying with the Purchase Order Requisition
Process.
(Ord. 2017-24. Passed 8-14-17; Ord. 2020-28. Passed 6-18-20.)

location, until they are deposited pursuant to (a) or (b) above.
(Ord. 2020-29. Passed 6-18-20.)

expended and a request for replenishment of such funds shall be submitted to
the Fiscal Officer.

the department head shall submit the inventory disposal form maintained by the
Village to the Village Fiscal Officer. The updated and/or corrected inventory
on the department inventory form shall be submitted during the annual inventory
period at the start of each new year and filed with the Village Fiscal Officer
by January 31st of each year.

documented on the Village form, "Equipment Assigned to Individuals", after the
department head has received an executed acknowledgment for receipt from the
individual acknowledging receipt of the equipment which documents the serial
and model numbers, if any, of the equipment. Any individual assigned equipment

    (a)    The following ADA Grievance Procedure is established as to the

clearly state the name and address of the complainant and the particulars of
the alleged violation. Individuals with a disability shall be given any special
assistance required in filing a complaint.
      (2)   The Disabled Coordinator shall, after receiving such complaint,
promptly inform the Mayor of the filing of the complaint in order that he may
set a hearing upon the complaint within fifteen working days of its filing and

shall then make a prompt and full investigation and turn over his or her
findings and recommendations to the Mayor within ten working days of the filing
of the complaint.
      (3)    The Mayor shall conduct an administrative hearing upon such
complaint within fifteen working days of its filing. At the hearing, the

hearing shall be supplied by the Village. The Mayor shall render his written
decision within five working days of the hearing. Should the complainant choose
not to appear for the hearing, the Mayor shall render his decision based upon
the complaint and the Coordinator's investigation report and all other
resources at his disposal. The Mayor shall determine and include in his
decision which, if any, special accommodations or modifications were considered
and his findings and determinations with reasons therefor as to whether the
same would present an undue burden upon the Village.
      (4)   If the complaint cannot be resolved to the complainant's
satisfaction by the Mayor, the complainant may make written request to the
Village Fiscal Officer within five working days of the Mayor's decision that
the complaint be heard and discussed at an open, public meeting of Council.

the complainant shall be conducted within thirty days of the next meeting of
Council. Proceedings shall be recorded and maintained. Council shall render its
decision in writing within thirty days of the hearing. The decision of Council
shall be final.
      (5)    A record of action taken on all complaints and requests shall be
maintained as part of the records or minutes at each level of the grievance
process.
      (6)    A complainant's right to a prompt and equitable resolution of his
or her complaint or request shall not be impaired by his or her pursuit of
other remedies and use of this grievance procedure shall not be considered a
prerequisite to the pursuit of other remedies.
      (7)    Council reserves the right to appoint a special committee or board
to hold the required public hearing upon an appeal of the Mayor's decision upon
any complaint under this section and to make written recommendations to Council
before Council's decision upon the complaint.
   (b)   Any requests or suggestions regarding access to and participation in
public facilities, services and functions of the Village by qualified
individuals with a disability shall be made through the Disabled Special
Assistance Office for review and prompt presentation to the Mayor for
consideration.
   (c)    The Disabled Special Assistance Office shall keep a record of all
requests and complaints filed and action taken thereon.

member of the Planning Commission, including but not limited to, the ability to
vote. In the event any alternate member participates in a matter which does not
conclude at such meeting, but is continued for further deliberations, the

the conclusion of such matter and the substituted member(s) shall not
participate in such matter.
(Ord. 1942-1. Passed 1-6-42; Ord. 2020-03. Passed 1-13-20; Ord. 2023-32. Passed

260.04 FILING FEE FOR MINOR SUBDIVISION REVIEW.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Ordinance 1974-14, passed September 9, 1974, is no longer
codified herein since it has been superseded by later ordinances establishing
fee schedules, reference to which is made under Part Twelve - Planning and
Zoning Code.)
260.05 APPEAL OF PROFESSIONAL FEES.
   (a)   Whenever a person, firm, corporation, or other entity (the
"applicant") is required by ordinance, rule or regulation of this Village to
pay to the Village the fees for review or inspection of a project involving the
applicant by any professional on the Village's behalf (such as the Village's
Engineer, Solicitor, Architect, Landscape Architect, or Hydrogeologist,
hereinafter the "professional") such applicant shall have the right to appeal
to the Planning Commission the amount of such professional's fees charged to
the applicant.
   (b)    The appeal shall be initiated within thirty days after the fees are
invoiced to the applicant by the Village, by the filing of a written Notice of
Appeal with the Secretary of the Planning Commission, together with a deposit
of an official bank check or certified check, or cash, in the full amount of
the professional's fees which the applicant disputes. Such deposits shall
thereafter be held by the Village until such time as the Planning Commission
renders its decision as set forth below. The Notice of Appeal shall set forth a
written summary of the applicant's grounds for disputing such fees. The
professional involved shall thereafter file within fifteen days, a written
response to the applicant's appeal.
   (c)   No later than fifteen days after the filing of such response, the
Planning Commission shall conduct a hearing relative to the applicant's appeal.
The Planning Commission shall afford both the applicant and the professional
the opportunity to present witnesses on its own behalf and to cross-examine
evidence of the other.
   (d)   The Planning Commission shall thereafter determine, by a majority
vote, whether the applicant has demonstrated, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the professional's fees are unreasonable. Reasonableness shall
be determined based upon the following factors:
      (1)    The terms of the contract between the Village and the
professional.
      (2)    The complexity of the matter under review by the professional.
      (3)    Any events or circumstances affecting the professional's review
which were beyond the reasonable control of the professional.
      (4)    The amount of time expended on the review by the professional and
the nature of the issues under review.
   (e)   In the event the Planning Commission denies the appeal, the Village
shall immediately utilize the deposit previously referred to herein for the
payment of the professional's fees. In the event the Planning Commission agrees
with the applicant that the professional's fees are unreasonable, then the
Planning Commission shall determine a reasonable amount for such professional
fees and shall thereafter direct the Village to pay to such professional the
amount so determined from the deposit previously referred to herein. The
balance remaining in such deposit shall be remitted to the applicant. Either
the professional or the applicant or both, may appeal the decision of the
Planning Commission to the Court of Common Pleas under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
The Village shall have no liability to the professional for services rendered
on any project of an applicant for any sums determined under this section to
have been unreasonably charged for such professional's services.
(Ord. 1993-47. Passed 11-8-93.)

charges having been served upon the member so charged at least ten days prior
to the hearing, either personally or by certified mail or by leaving the same
at his usual place of residence. The member shall be given an opportunity to be
heard and answer such charges.
      (2)   The Mayor may appoint, subject to confirmation by Council, up to
one resident of the Village to serve as an alternate member of the Board of
Zoning Appeals for a term of four years each. This alternate member shall be in
addition to the regular members and may substitute for regular members of the
Board of Zoning Appeals who are unable to attend a meeting of or participate in
a matter before the Board of Zoning Appeals. The alternate member at such
meeting or such matter shall have all the powers and duties of a regular member
of the Board of Zoning Appeals, including but not limited to the ability to
vote. In the event the alternate member participates in a matter which does
conclude at such meeting, but is continued for further deliberations, the
alternate member shall remain in substitution for the regular member(s) until
the conclusion of such matter and the substituted regular member(s) shall not
participate in such matter.
    (b)   Organization and Procedure. The Board shall organize annually to
elect a chairman, and a vice-chairman. It shall further adopt rules for its own
government not inconsistent with law or with any other ordinances of the
Village to hear appeals or any other matters authorized by the provisions of
the Zoning Code.
      (1)   Meetings. Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the
chairman and at such other times as the Board may determine. The chairman, or
in his absence, the vice-chairman or in the event the vice-chairman is absent,
such member elected to chair the meeting, may administer oaths and the Board
may compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the Board shall be open
to the public except that the Board may be permitted to meet in closed session
while adjudicating appeals presented to the Board. The Board shall keep minutes
of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if
absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep such records of
its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately
filed in the office of the Clerk for the Village and shall be a public record.
      (2)   Quorum. Three members of the Board shall constitute a quorum. The
Board shall act by motion and the concurring vote of a majority of the Board
attending any meeting shall be necessary to reverse any order or determination
of the Zoning Inspector or to decide in favor of an applicant any matter of
which the Board has original jurisdiction under the Zoning Code, or to grant
any variance from the requirements stipulated in the Zoning Code.
      (3)    Department assistance. The Board may call upon the various
departments of the Village for assistance in the performance of its duties, and
it shall be the duty of such departments to render such assistance to the Board
as may reasonably be required.
      (4)    Solicitor's duties. The Board may call upon the Village Solicitor
for assistance in the performance of its duties, and in the conduct of its
meetings.

fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).

written evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The
offender shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for
the violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender's payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (b) of this section.

414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway

in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.

is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,

qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing
administer a chemical test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to
any administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person's own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person's expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
"national highway traffic safety administration" means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United

violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety

impose upon the offender a fine of not more than $250.
         C.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been

R.C. § 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent or municipal ordinance, the
court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than $500. The court

the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall impose
upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the violation
under division (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom division
(d)(1)A. of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of $150 under
division (d)(1)A. of this section and the assessment of points under division
(d)(4) of this section, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted

and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender

against that offender’s driver’s license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (a) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a
dismissal of the charges for the violation, and the violation is a prior
offense under divisions (d)(1)B. and (d)(1)C. of this section if the offender
commits a subsequent violation or violations of division (a) of this section
within two years of the offense for which the course was completed. This
division does not apply with respect to any offender in the category of

be assessed for a violation of division (a) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for purposes of enforcing this section

436.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02. (ORC 4510.12)
436.02 PERMITTING OPERATION WITHOUT VALID LICENSE; ONE LICENSE PERMITTED.
   (a)   No person shall permit the operation of a motor vehicle upon any
public or private property used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel
or parking, knowing the operator does not have a valid driver’s license issued
to the operator by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles or a deputy registrar under
R.C. Chapter 4507 or a valid commercial driver’s license issued under R.C.
Chapter 4506. Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
this division is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to R.C. §§
2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be sentenced to a jail
term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community residential sanction
pursuant to R.C. § 2929.26; notwithstanding R.C. § 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the
offender may be fined up to $1,000; and, notwithstanding R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3),
the offender may be ordered pursuant to R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of
community service of up to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a
term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect
criminal contempt under R.C. § 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying
case. If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
   (b)   (1)   No person shall receive a driver’s license, or a motorcycle
operator’s endorsement of a driver’s or commercial driver’s license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card unless and until the person
surrenders to the Registrar or a deputy registrar all valid licenses, temporary
instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together
with information that the license, temporary instruction permit, or
identification card is now issued in this state. The Registrar or a deputy
registrar shall destroy any such license, temporary instruction permit, or
identification card that is not returned to the issuing authority.
      (3)   No person shall possess more than one valid license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card at any time.

for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated

traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated

restraining device in violation of subsection (b)(1) or (3) or the failure of a
person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2) of this
section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff's failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   (1)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be
fined thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates
subsection (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
subsection (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates subsection (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree. (ORC 4513.263)

sign, whether permanently affixed or movable, imprinted with the international
symbol of access and shall be reasonably close to exits, entrances, elevators
and ramps. All elevated signs posted in accordance with this division and R.C.
§ 3781.111(C) shall be mounted on a fixed or movable post, and the distance
from the ground to the bottom edge of the sign shall measure not less than five

location is posted on or after October 14, 1999, there also shall be affixed
upon the surface of that sign or affixed next to the designating sign a notice

entitled to be parked in that location.
   (f)   (1)   A.   No person shall stop, stand or park any motor vehicle at

location in violation of division (f)(1)A.1. or (f)(1)A.2. of this section may
be towed or otherwise removed from the parking location by the law enforcement

not be released to its owner until the owner presents proof of ownership of the
motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally imposed by the
municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor vehicle is a
leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the lessee
presents proof that that person is the lessee of the motor vehicle and pays all

legal parking period permitted by local authorities, except where local
ordinances or police rules provide otherwise or where the vehicle is parked in
such a manner as to be clearly a traffic hazard.
   (h)   No owner of an office, facility or parking garage where accessible
parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with division (e)
of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking locations in
accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of the
accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed or
movable signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or

plates if the parking card or accessible license plates issued to the person or
organization under prior law have not expired or been surrendered or revoked.

   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely

due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
606.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
606.08 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
606.09 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24; Ord. 1973-21. Passed 12-10-73.)
606.10 FALSIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly make a false statement, or knowingly swear
or affirm the truth of a false statement previously made, when any of the
following applies:
      (1)   The statement is made in any official proceeding.
      (2)   The statement is made with purpose to incriminate another.
      (3)   The statement is made with purpose to mislead a public official in
performing the public official’s official function.
      (4)   The statement is made with purpose to secure the payment of
unemployment compensation; Ohio works first; prevention, retention and
contingency benefits and services; disability financial assistance; retirement
benefits or health care coverage from a state retirement system; economic

      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evalute such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
606.22 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
606.23 COMPLICITY.

commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
(1)    Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
(2)    Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
(3)    Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)    It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)    No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
606.22.
   (d)    If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
    "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
    "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)     It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.    
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.

failure to erect signs of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2903.081 in a
particular construction zone in accordance with those guidelines and design
specifications does not limit or affect the application of subsections (a)(1)A.
or (a)(2) of this section in that construction zone or the prosecution of any
person who violates any of those subsections in that construction zone.

degree. Vehicular assault is a felony if, at the time of the offense, the

has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of this section or any

the indictment, count in the indictment or information charging the offense,
the court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term as provided in
R.C. § 2929.24(F).
   (e)   A prosecution for a violation of division (a) or (b) of this section
does not preclude a prosecution of a violation of any other section of the Ohio
Revised Code. One or more acts, a series of acts, or a course of behavior that
can be prosecuted under division (a) or (b) of this section or any other
section of the Ohio Revised Code may be prosecuted under division (a) or (b) of
this section, the other section of the Ohio Revised Code, the municipal
ordinance, or both sections. However, if an offender is convicted of or pleads
guilty to a violation of division (a) or (b) of this section and also is
convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of R.C. § 2903.22, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, based on the same conduct
involving the same victim that was the basis of the violation of division (a)
or (b) of this section, the offenses are allied offenses of similar import
under R.C. § 2941.25.

698.02  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (a) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (a) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (a), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (a) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (a) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (a)(1)B.1. and
(a)(1)B.2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by
law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including but not limited to the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including but not limited to a per diem fee for room and
board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of repairing
property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (a)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (a) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under R.C. § 2929.27 in lieu of
imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court does not determine
that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term of community service
under R.C. § 2929.27 in lieu of or in addition to imposing a financial sanction
under this division (a) and in addition to imposing court costs. The court may
order community service for a minor misdemeanor pursuant to R.C. § 2929.27 in
lieu of or in addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and
in addition to imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial
sanction or court costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the
financial sanction or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (a)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under R.C. §§ 2929.26 and
2929.27 or division (a) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under R.C. § 2929.26 to the
County Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s General Fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the Fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
R.C. §§ 2929.26 and 2929.27 or division (a) of this section or in operating a
facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed R.C. §
2929.26.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (a)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under R.C. §§ 2929.26
and 2929.27 or division (a) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under R.C. § 2929.26 to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the Fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
R.C. §§ 2929.26 and 2929.27 or division (a) of this section or in operating a
facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under R.C. §
2929.26.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (a)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under R.C. §§ 2929.26 and 2929.27 or division
(a) of this section to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (a)(4)B.
and (a)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (a)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (a)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (a)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (a)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (a)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (a)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (a)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (a)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (a)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (a)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state or political subdivision may
do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (a)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (a) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (a), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (a) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
         (R.C. § 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5)
of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to
law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court's
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender's jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender's term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender's participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241
or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and any
residential sanction imposed for the violation under R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction
imposed under this division shall be considered to be a community control
sanction for purposes of R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and
the Ohio Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply
to a sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would
by their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under R.C. § 2929.26 or § 2929.27 for
any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor Maximum Fine
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section 501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to
this subsection (c).
         (ORC 2929.31)
698.03  IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by R.C. §
1547.99(G), 4510.14(B) or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Revised
Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under this
chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion
to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and principles of
sentencing set forth in §
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of R.C. §§ 2929.23 to 2929.28, a
court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on
the offender any sanction or combination of sanctions under §
698.02(b). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an unnecessary
burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
(b)(1)C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in R.C. § 2929.21.
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under § 698.02(a) or R.C. §§
2929.25, 2929.26, and 2929.27. A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under § 698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of
the offense or upon offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for
prior offenses demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is
necessary to deter the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22)
698.04 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the penalties provided in Section
698.02, or in any other section of these Codified Ordinances, an organization
convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, shall be fined, which fine shall be fixed by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000);
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31; Ord. 1973-21. Passed 12-10-73.)
698.05 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other sentence of
imprisonment imposed by this Municipality, the State, another state, or a court
of the United States. In any case, a sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a sentence of imprisonment for felony served
in a State or Federal penal or reformatory institution.
   (b)   A sentence of imprisonment shall be served consecutively to any other
sentence of imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively.
   (c)   Subject to the maximum provided in subsection (d) hereof, when
consecutive sentences of imprisonment are imposed for misdemeanor, the term to
be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed.
   (d)   Consecutive terms of imprisonment imposed shall not exceed an
aggregate term of eighteen months, when the consecutive terms imposed are for
misdemeanors. When consecutive terms aggregating more than one year are imposed
for misdemeanors under the Ohio Revised Code or these Codified Ordinances, and
at least one such consecutive term is for a misdemeanor of the first degree,
the trial court may order the aggregate term imposed to be served in a State
penal or reformatory institution. (ORC 2929.41)
698.06 MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE.
   (a)   At the time of sentencing and thereafter when imprisonment for
misdemeanor is imposed, the court may:
      (1)   Suspend the sentence and place the offender on probation pursuant
to Ohio R.C. 2951.02;
      (2)   Permit the offender to serve his sentence in intermittent
confinement, overnight, or on weekends, or both, or at such other time or times
as will allow him to continue at his occupation or care for his family;
      (3)   Require the offender to serve a portion of his sentence, which may
be served in intermittent confinement, suspend the balance of the sentence and
place the offender on probation pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2951.02.
   (b)   At the time of sentencing and thereafter when a fine is imposed, the
court may:
      (1)   Suspend all or any portion of the fine, upon such conditions as the
court imposes in the interests of justice and the correction and rehabilitation
of the offender;
      (2)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the fine in installments,
or by such other method and in such time and on such terms as the court
considers just, except that the maximum time permitted for payment shall not
exceed two years.

880.05 METHOD OF DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX.
   In the taxation of income which is subject to the Village Income Tax, if the
books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession both within
and without the boundaries of the Village shall disclose with reasonable
accuracy what portion of its net profit is attributable to that part of the
business or profession conducted within the boundaries of the Village, then
only such portion shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the Village
for the purposes of Municipal income taxation. The portion of the entire net
profits of a taxpayer to be allocated as having been derived from within the
Village, in the absence of actual records thereof, shall be determined as
follows:
    Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight as follows:
   (a)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal property
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the Village
during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the real and
tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used in this
subsection, real property includes property rented or leased by the taxpayer
and the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual
rental thereon by eight.
   (b)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable period
to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed in the
Village to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same period
to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their services are
performed.
   (c)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Village to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
    In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result. (Ord. 1971-19. Passed 11-22-71.)   
880.06 SALES MADE IN THE VILLAGE.
As used in Section
880.05(c) "sales made in the Village" means:
    (a)    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the Village.
    (b)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
Village regardless of where title passes even though transported from a point
outside the Village if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
   (c)    All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place
within the Village to purchasers outside of the Village regardless of where
title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.

880.07 TOTAL ALLOCATION.
    Add together the percentages determined in accordance with Section
880.05(a), (b) and (c) or such of the aforesaid percentages as are applicable
to the particular taxpayer and divide the total so obtained by the number of
percentages used in deriving such total in order to obtain the business
allocation percentage referred to in Section
880.05.

outside the Village. (Ord. 1971-19. Passed 11-22-71.)

880.09 OPERATING LOSS CARRY-FORWARD.
    (a)    The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year

until exhausted, but in no event for more than five taxable years immediately
following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating
loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.   
    (b)    The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the Village in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to
the Village.
   (c)   The Administrator shall provide by rules and regulations the manner in
which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined. (Ord. 1971-19.

interest shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is filed and the
final tax paid within the period as extended.
(Ord. 1971-19. Passed 11-22-71.)

require such additional information as he may deem necessary to ascertain

   Either the Administrator hereunder or the Board of Review may abate a
penalty or interest, or both, in accordance with the following guidelines:
   (a)   After consultation with the Mayor and Finance Committee Chairman, the
Administrator may exercise reasonable judgment in compromising any interest
and/or penalties due the Village. Such reasonable judgment shall include, but
not be limited to consideration of the following factors.
      (1)   The clarity of the liability of the taxpayer. The more certain the
liability of the taxpayer for the underlying tax, the lower the amount of any
compromise by the Administrator should be.
      (2)   Any exculpatory reasons offered by the taxpayer for the liability.
Tax liabilities created by good-faith mistakes and/or minimal negligence by the
taxpayer may increase the amount of any compromise.
      (3)   The collectability of the taxpayer. The greater the taxpayer’s
apparent collectability, the lower the amount of any compromise should be.
      (4)   The taxpaying history of the taxpayer. The greater the taxpayer’s
history of compliance with the Village’s tax requirements, the greater the
amount of the compromise may be.
      (5)   Any other relevant factor demonstrating good cause for a
compromise.
   (b)   In no event shall the Administrator compromise the amount of interest
owed to the Village by more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total amount
due up to a maximum of one thousand dollars ($1,000). In no event shall the
Administrator compromise the amount of penalties due by more than twenty-five
percent (25%) up to a maximum of one thousand dollars ($1,000).
   (c)   Any written offer of compromise not accepted by the taxpayer within
fifteen (15) days after the date of such written offer shall expire and such
offer of compromise by the Administrator shall not be binding upon the Village
in any subsequent appeal.
   (d)   The Board of Review may abate a penalty or interest, or both, and
shall also consider the factors set forth in subsections (a)(1), (2), (3), (4)
and (5).

tax paid on such taxable income to such other municipality, equal to seventy-
five percent of the amount obtained by multiplying the lower of the tax rate of

881.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (1)   "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under division 23(D) of this section, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (A)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (C)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
      (D)   (i)   Except as provided in division (1)(D)(ii) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (ii)    Division (1)(D)(i) of this section does not apply to the
extent the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250
of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (E)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;
      (F)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;
      (G)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Ohio Revised Code;
      (H)   (i)    Except as limited by divisions (1)(H)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of
this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
         (ii)   No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (1)(H) of
this section to offset qualifying wages.
         (iii)   (a)   For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021,
or 2022, a person may not deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a
municipal corporation that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, more
than fifty per cent of the amount of the deduction otherwise allowed by
division (1)(H)(i) of this section.
            (b)    For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a person

the extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully utilized in
one or more taxable years by operation of division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this
section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in
division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section shall apply to the amount carried
forward.
      (I)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or

Section
881.063 of this Chapter.

made the election described in division (47)(B) of this section, is not a
publicly traded partnership that has made the election described in division

adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.

federal self-employment tax.

the tax administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.

tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
881.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,

qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)    In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule: (Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
         (a)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) or (B)(1)(c) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payment to the Tax
Administrator not later than the last day of the month following the last day
of each calendar quarter.
            (Ord. 2016-29. Passed 9-12-16.)
          (b)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted

behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the

banking day after the fifteenth day of that month;
            (ii)   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and before the first
day of the immediately following month, the third banking day after the last
day of that month.
         (d)   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required to
make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the
Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
881.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have

   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal

corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable

qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

as provided in Section
 881.051 of this Chapter.

professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to

has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)

owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
 881.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
881.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.
(Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.053 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
    (A)    The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
section 3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales
agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct
and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
   (C)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator
shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
      (2)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If
the name, address, or social security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)    A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)    For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or
annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or
filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at
the rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section 881.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for
whom the amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section. (Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.06 INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX.
881.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
 881.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
 881.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
881.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section
 881.062 of this Chapter.   
      (4)   "Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carryforward" is defined in Section

         (Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.062 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (F)(2) and (G) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
881.052  of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B) (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
881.19  of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
 881.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)     For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in division (I) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made
and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
   A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
881.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
881.03  of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
   This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity. (Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
   (I)   (1)   As used in this division:
         (a)   "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)   "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)   "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under this chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)   "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (B) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
            A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
            The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
            After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies
to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
            Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (D)
(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a tax payer that has made
the election described in division (I)(2) of this section:
         (a)   For the purpose of division (A)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (A)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's location.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (A)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B) of this section. However, a tax administrator shall
not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would
require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to this chapter.

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
881.03 (1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
 881.03  of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
 881.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
881.062  of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
881.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
 881.062  of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

purposes of this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal

all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the

provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the

      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section 881.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)    For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended

         (b)    For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)    An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's

tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section 881.10 of
this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment,

of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by

cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
 881.091  of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

factors.

881.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
881.081 TAX CREDIT.
   (a)   When the taxable income of a resident of the Village is subject to a
municipal income tax in another municipality on the same income taxable under
this chapter, such resident shall be allowed a credit of the amount of income
tax paid on such taxable income to such other municipality, equal to seventy-
five percent of the amount obtained by multiplying the lower of the tax rate of
such other municipality or of the Village by the taxable income earned in or
attributable to the municipality of employment or business activity. For the
purposes of this section, taxable income includes the distributive share of net
profits of a resident partner or owner of an unincorporated business entity.
   (b)   A claim for credit or refund under this section shall be made in such
manner as the Administrator may, by regulation, provide. In the event such
Village resident fails, neglects or refuses to file an annual return or
declaration on the form prescribed by the Administrator, he shall not be
entitled to such credit or refund and shall be considered in violation of this
chapter for failure to file a return.

      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation. (Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section 881.081 of this
Chapter. (Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
 881.096  of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
881.096 , the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
881.096  of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
881.081  of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

"submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has designated for
the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date as the date the
payment was initiated by the taxpayer. (Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9- 15; Ord.
2016-29. Passed 9-12-16.)
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
 881.051  of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
881.052  of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer
and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such
a registration is required by the municipal corporation's resolutions,
ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of
perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
(Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.

division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)     Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the
extended due date of the municipality's income tax return for a taxpayer that
is not an individual shall be the fifteenth day of the eleventh month after the
last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
   (F)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (A), (B), or (C) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
   If a tax administrator violates division (F) of this section, the municipal
corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
   This division (F) does not apply to an extension received under division (B)
of this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that the taxpayer
failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the extension
under division (B) of this section or failed to file for an extension under
division (C) of this section.

Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
881.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

section
881.19  of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed
beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
881.096  of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
881.18  of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
881.10  of this Chapter.

Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

(Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement. (Ord. 2015-35. Passed
11-9-15.)
881.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
881.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
881.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
881.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
881.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
881.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
 881.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)    No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)    A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
881.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
881.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
881.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
881.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
           (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition
of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-35. Passed 11-9-15.)
881.20  ADOPTION OF RULES.

continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the

unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other

   (C)    The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer sections

881.03 of the Village Codified Ordinances. (Ord. 2018-17. Passed 4-9-18.)
882.02 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703. of the Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and section
881.03 of the Codified Ordinances the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in sections
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in sections
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under section
881.062 of the Codified Ordinances as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
section
881.03 of the Codified Ordinances means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
section
881.063 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of section
881.063 of the Codified Ordinances.
   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division 47 (B) of section
881.063 of the Codified Ordinances and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in division 23 (D) of section
881.063 of the Codified Ordinances the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
   Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section
881.03 of the Codified Ordinances except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745. of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections
881.01 to
881.99 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal income
taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
881.03 (2) of the Codified Ordinances.

profession in the Village and that has made the election under section
882.01 of the Codified Ordinances.

profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of Village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession

the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.

include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Chapter
881 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the Village to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require,
that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Chapter
881 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Chapter
881 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the Village

         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village from
a stock of goods located within the Village.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the Village from a location
outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the Village.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the Village in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the Village based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the Village to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under division (C)(11) of section
881.03 of the Codified Ordinances by the Village or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to the Village. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the Village any
amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay
tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Village under
this section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

applicable, Chapter
881 of the Codified Ordinances onto its annual return.

extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with this Chapter of the Codified
Ordinances the commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (E)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (F)    When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
(Ord. 2018-17. Passed 4-9-18.)
882.06 ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (A)    All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under section
882.01 of the Codified Ordinances shall file any tax return or extension for
filing a tax return, and shall make payment of amounts shown to be due on such
returns, electronically, either through the Ohio business gateway or in another
manner as prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)    A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the
commissioner, to be excused from the requirement to file returns and make
payments electronically. For good cause shown, the commissioner may excuse the
applicant from the requirement and permit the applicant to file the returns or
make the payments by nonelectronic means.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)    The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns
and make payments by electronic means;
      (2)    The information taxpayers must submit when filing tax returns by
electronic means. (Ord. 2018-17. Passed 4-9-18.)
882.07 CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section
882.01 of the Codified Ordinance a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (B)(1) or (2) of this section of the Codified Ordinance is binding
upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under section
882.01 of the Codified Ordinance is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in this Chapter of the Codified
Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of this section of the
Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in this section of the Codified
Ordinances exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded,
the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in this section of the Codified
Ordinances include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included,
the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis
of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in this section of the Codified Ordinances exclude
the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the
computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
882.03 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from"
appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations"
for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under section
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. 2018-17. Passed 4-9-18.)
882.08 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
882.01 of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
sections
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 2018-17. Passed 4-9-18.)
882.09 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 2018-17. Passed 4-9-18.)
882.10 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by Chapter 811 of the
Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the following
penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a
penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
882.01 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax required
to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to
fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances a penalty may be imposed not exceeding
the greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
section
882.11 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code. (Ord. 2018- 17. Passed 4-9-18.)
882.11 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Chapter
881 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be no
bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by sections
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by this Chapter or Chapter 881 of the Codified
Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by that section.
(Ord. 2018-17. Passed 4-9-18.)
882.12 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of section
882.11 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 2018-17. Passed 4-9-18.)
882.13 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
882.01 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under this
Chapter of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances for
the purpose of assessing any additional tax due under this section, together
with any applicable penalty and interest. The amended return shall not reopen
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed
return no longer subject to assessment that are not affected, either directly
or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms
to the requirements of this Chapter. An application filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the
time prescribed in this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances. The application
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return. (Ord. 2018-17. Passed 4-9-18.)
882.14 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
882.01 to
882.16 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 2018-17. Passed 4-9-18.)
882.15 CREDITS.
   (A)    A credit, granted by resolution or ordinance of the Village pursuant
to Chapter
881 or this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances, shall be available to a
taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
882.01 of the Codified Ordinances, against the municipal corporation's tax on
income. A municipal corporation shall submit the following information to the
tax commissioner on or before the later of January 31, 2018, or the thirty-
first day of January of the first year in which the taxpayer is eligible to

entered into between the Village and the taxpayer.
   (B)   (1)    Each taxpayer that claims a credit shall submit, with the
taxpayer's tax return, documentation issued by the Village granting the credit
that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the credit, the amount of the
credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the tax year to which the credit
is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the Village and taxpayer under Chapter
881 or this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances, or to modify the terms or
conditions of any such existing agreement.

1010.01 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
    No person, other than the Village, who has cause to perform work
necessitating the involvement of a portion of the streets, rights of way,
drainage system, water and sewer systems and sidewalks of the Village, shall
perform such work without first having complied with the provisions of this
chapter. (Ord. 1971-18. Passed 11-8-71.)
1010.02 APPLICATION.
   Before any person, other than the Village, does any work involving a portion
of the streets, rights of way, drainage system, water and sewer systems and
sidewalks of the Village, the person shall make application to the Building
Inspector, detailing the nature of the work contemplated, the method of work,
the remedial work planned, the starting date and the anticipated completion
date. (Ord.1993-2. Passed 1-11-93.)
1010.03 RIGHT- OF-WAY PERMIT.
   (a)    The Building Inspector shall review the application for any work in
the right of way for compliance with Section
1010.02 and determine if a permit may be issued. If a permit is granted, a fee
in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be submitted to the Village by
the applicant. The Building Inspector will also determine if a bond is
required, and, if so, the bond must be submitted prior to issuance of the
permit. The bond may be either cash, certified check, or a surety bond
satisfactory to the Building Inspector. The bond shall not exceed the maximum
cost necessary to reimburse the Village should it be necessary for the Village
to complete that portion of the work involving its streets, rights of way,
drainage system, water and sewer systems and sidewalks.
   (b)    The work shall be performed under the direction of the Building
Inspector and the Street Commissioner and in accordance with the specifications
approved by the Building Inspector. If the work does not proceed according to
the Inspector and the Commissioner, the Inspector may withdraw the permit and
turn the matter over to the Village Engineer to proceed in accordance with
Sections
1010.04 through
1010.05. (Ord.1993-2. Passed 1-11-93.)
1010.04 RESPONSIBILITIES OF ENGINEER.
   If, after reviewing the application submitted under Section
1010.02, the Building Inspector determines that the Village Engineer's review
is required, the application and requirements as set forth in Section
1010.02 shall be forwarded to the Engineer for his review. The Engineer shall
review the application and advise in writing the suggested method of new or
remedial work, and the time allotted. The Engineer shall also advise the
applicant of the estimated cost of the involvement of work in the right of way,
and suggest a bond. The bond shall not exceed the maximum cost necessary to
reimburse the Village should it be necessary for the Village to complete that
portion of the work involving its streets, rights of way, drainage system,
water and sewer systems and sidewalks.
(Ord.1993-2. Passed 1-11-93.)
1010.05 RIGHT-OF-WAY PERMIT; BOND.
   The Building Inspector shall issue a right-of-way permit to the applicant
after the Engineer has submitted his recommendations in writing to the
applicant and after the applicant, in response to these recommendations, has
agreed to such recommendations and submitted a bond as recommended by the
Engineer and has submitted the fee for the permit in the amount of fifty
dollars ($50.00).
(Ord.1993-2. Passed 1-11-93.)
1010.06 DEPOSITS FOR ENGINEER’S REVIEW AND INSPECTION COSTS.
   Whenever a right of way application is forwarded to the Engineer for his
review, a deposit of five hundred dollars ($500.00) is required with the
application. Fees for the Engineer's review, administration, overhead expenses,
and site supervision or inspections will be deducted from this deposit. In the
event the Village determines to utilize persons other than the Village Engineer
for such inspections or site supervision, a deposit of five hundred dollars
($500.00) shall be required before a permit may be issued and the fees for such
inspections may also be deducted from this deposit. If the actual costs exceed
the deposit, the applicant shall pay the additional costs incurred within seven
days of receipt of a statement indicating the amount due. In the event the
actual costs plus fifteen percent (15%) overhead are less than the amount
deposited by the applicant, the Village shall refund the balance.
(Ord. 1993-21. Passed 4-26-93.)
1010.07 NONCOMPLIANCE; REMEDY OF VILLAGE.
   (a)    If, for any reason, the proposed work is done, is being done, or is
proposed to be done in a manner other than that specified in the approved
application and/or the Engineer's recommendations, the Building Inspector shall
send written notice to the applicant, specifying where the applicant has failed
to comply, and give him five days to correct the deficiency. If the applicant
fails to correct the deficiency within five days, the Building Inspector may,
at his option, consider the right-of-way permit void and cause the work to be
completed in accordance with the approved application and/or the Engineer's
recommendations and forfeit the bond to the extent of the cost to the Village
of the work performed.
   (b)    In the event the Building Inspector determines the manner in which
the applicant is performing such work has created an emergency situation
wherein Village and/or private property or personnel is being endangered or
damaged by such performance, then the Building Inspector is authorized to
notify the applicant to stop work immediately. The notification may be verbal,
to be followed by an order to be issued in writing; shall be effective upon its
issuance; and shall be considered a stop work order, the violation of which may
be enjoined by the Village upon proper application to the appropriate court.
   (c)    In the event the status of the work at the time such stop work order
is issued is such that a clear and present danger to Village personnel or
property exists, the Village may undertake any appropriate measure to alleviate
potential danger and the costs for all such measures shall be borne by the
applicant, including but not limited to engineering fees, materials, labor and
all other costs.
   (d)   The applicant may appeal such stop work order to Council which shall
thereafter decide such appeal within fourteen days after the filing of such
appeal with the Fiscal Officer. If the applicant fails to satisfy Council that
it may safely and appropriately complete the work, then the right-of-way permit
shall be declared void and Council shall cause the work to be completed in
accordance with the approved application and/or the Engineer’s recommendations,
at the applicant’s costs.
(Ord. 1993-2. Passed 1-11-93.)

abutting property shall first obtain a right-of-way permit as provided in
Section 1010.03. The length, diameter, depth and slope of materials to be used
in such culvert shall first be approved by the Street Commissioner. The
standard culvert pipe diameter shall be at least eight inches and have a
minimum cover depth of six inches above the crown of the pipe. The culvert pipe
shall extend a minimum of twelve inches beyond the adjacent driveway pavement
edge. The minimum standard for culvert pipe size and installation may be
adjusted by the Street Commissioner and/or the Village Engineer as warranted by
site conditions.
   (b)    No person shall fill in, cover, regrade or alter the course or grade
of any roadside ditch or otherwise change the grade of a ditch, tree lawn or
any portion of a dedicated street in the Village, without first obtaining a
right-of-way permit therefor. Any such filling in, covering, regrading or
alteration shall be subject to the approval and inspection, at all times of the
Street Commissioner.
(Ord. 1993-2. Passed 1-11-93; Ord. 2020-20. Passed 4-13-20.)

serve, in the opinion of the Building Inspector, to reasonably minimize any
adverse visual and/or auditory impact of such septic system upon adjacent
properties and the surrounding neighborhood.
   (b)   In granting approval for such proposed septic system installation in a
front yard, the Building Inspector may condition his approval on timely
installation of any approved screening and upon the applicant’s agreement to
properly maintain, repair, and replace such screening. Upon approval by the
Building Inspector that the screening has been properly installed, the deposit
shall be refunded to the applicant, or designee of applicant.
   (c)   Any screening plan approved pursuant to this section must be properly
maintained, repaired and replaced in accordance with such plan by the owner of
the property, regardless of whether or not the owner of such property was the
owner at the time such plan was initially approved. Failure to do so within
thirty (30) days after the written notification from the Building Inspector
shall subject the property owner to the penalty provisions of Section
1480.99.

1028.01 WATER STUDY REQUIRED FOR CENTRAL WATER SYSTEMS.
    From and after the effective date of this section (Ordinance 1980-43,
passed October 27, 1980) and in the event there is a change of the original
plans submitted to the Village for a central water system, a water study is
hereby made a requirement of the person responsible for the operation of the
central water supply system. Such water study shall be in accordance with the
requirement set forth by the Village Engineer, who may seek expert assistance
therefor, and no change of the original water system shall be permitted until
and unless the water study is approved by the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 1980-43. Passed 10-27-80.)
1028.02 PREMISES SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS.
   From the effective date of this section, in the interest of promoting the
health, safety and general welfare of the Village, all central water systems,
which systems depend on surface water or ground water for their source of
supply, and which serve more than one residence, building or other structure or
premises within the Village shall be subject to the regulations as stated
hereinafter. (Ord. 1983-16. Passed 3-14-83.)
1028.03 TESTING REQUIRED.
   All central water systems depending on ground water for part or all of their
source of supply shall be tested monthly by a person, firm or other entity
approved by the State Department of Health to take such tests, or by the
Village Building Inspector, to determine the static water level and specific
capacity of the water supply remaining in the central water system. Such
testing shall be done by the use of automatic water level recorders attached to
the central water system using monthly reading charts. Any recorder used must
be manufactured with specifications approved by the Village hydrologist and the
minimum resolution applicable to such static water testing shall be plus or
minus one foot per one quarter day. (Ord. 1983-16. Passed 3-14-83.)
1028.04 DETERMINATION OF CONTAMINANTS.
   (a)    All central water systems shall be tested monthly by a testing
person, firm or entity as indicated in Section
1028.03, to monitor and determine the levels of nitrates and other contaminants
mentioned on any list adopted by the Ohio or United States Environmental
Protection Agencies in the ground water or surface water which is the source of
supply for the central water system.
   (b)    All central water systems shall also be tested and monitored for
other contaminants or natural conditions that may affect the quality or supply
of the source of water for such central water systems, upon establishment of
regulations which are prepared by the hydrologist retained by the Village and
approved by Council and posted in the same manner as are ordinances adopted by
Council. (Ord. 1983-16. Passed 3-14-83.)
1028.05 ADEQUATE WATER SUPPLY.
   Unless abandonment of the system is approved by the Public Utilities
Commission or the owner or operator of the system gives six months advance
notice of abandonment to the Village if the system is not subject to Public
Utilities Commission jurisdiction, then in the event that Council, for the
Village, determines that the test results of the static water level or specific
capacity show an insufficient amount of water to maintain an adequate water
supply for those persons, or other entities served by the same source of water,
the owner or operator or any system shall take sufficient steps to obtain
additional sources of water in order to maintain an adequate supply of water
for the persons, firms or other entities served by such system. In the event
the Village, by Council, determines that there is an inadequate supply of water
to service the consumers of such water, the Village may seek the penalty for
violations of this chapter as is imposed by this chapter, or may seek any other
legal or equitable relief it may deem appropriate, or may order the operator to
limit the quantity of water to be used per day until an adequate water supply
is restored or new wells in a different aquifer are obtained at such levels as
will adequately serve the users of such central water system.
(Ord. 1983-16. Passed 3-14-83. )
1028.06  UNSAFE SUPPLY.
   In the event that the results of the monthly monitoring test indicate that
there is an unsafe level of contaminants in the source of supply of water for
any central water system within the Village, as based on United States
Environmental Protection Agency standards for unsafe contaminant levels, or in
the event that the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency adopts such standards,
then the owner and/or operator of such system shall immediately take steps to
eliminate the contaminants from the source of supply and further take steps if
possible, to eliminate contaminants from entering into the source of supply for
the central water system. Upon learning of any test results indicating a
contaminant level in excess of standards established by the Village hydrologist
and approved by Council or adopted by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
or the standards of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the
owner or operator of such central water systems shall immediately notify the
Building Inspector for the Village of the test results. In the event that the
test results indicate an unsafe level of contaminants in the source of supply
for such central water system, the Building Inspector shall have the right and
the duty to order the system shut down to stop the supply of water and to order
all consumers of the water to immediately stop drinking such water and to avoid
bodily contact with the water if contact with such water will cause any harm to
consumers of the water. In the event that the owner/operator of such system
fails to notify the Building Inspector of any unsafe level of contaminants in
the source of water supply, or fails to take the necessary steps to eliminate
the source of contamination, if possible, or fails to take any other steps to
avoid any harm to consumers of the central water system, the owner and/or
operator of the system shall be in violation of this chapter and the
Municipality may seek any penalty imposed by this chapter or may seek any other
legal or equitable relief that it deems appropriate. (Ord. 1983-16. Passed 3-
14-83. )
1028.07 MONTHLY REPORTS.
   The owner and/or operator of each central water system within the Village
shall submit monthly reports as required by this chapter to the Building
Inspector for the Village within ten days of taking such tests. All monitoring
required by this chapter and all testing required by this chapter shall be
completed prior to the fifteenth day of each month.
(Ord. 1983-16. Passed 3-14-83; Ord. 1983-17. Passed 3-14-83.)
1028.08 SYSTEMS OUTSIDE MUNICIPALITY.
   This chapter shall also apply to any central water system which is located
in whole or in part outside of the Village but which services one or more
residences, buildings or other structures or premises within the Village.
(Ord. 1983-16. Passed 3-14-83; Ord. 1983-17. Passed 3-14-83. )
1028.09 SCOPE OF REGULATIONS.
   Notwithstanding the fact that any owner or operator of a central water
system shall be defined as a public utility under the Ohio Revised Code, it is
the intent of the Village that all operators and owners of central water
systems servicing consumers of such water systems within the Village be subject
to and bound by the regulations contained in this chapter.
(Ord. 1983-16. Passed 3-14-83; Ord. 1983-17. Passed 3-14-83.)
1028.10 MICROBIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL TESTS.
   (a)   From and after the effective date of this section all central water
systems within the Village shall be tested and monitored as set forth in the
regulations established by the Village Hydrologist, a copy of which is attached
to Ordinance 1983-17. All central water systems shall perform microbiological
tests at a minimum frequency of one set of tests per month and at a greater
frequency per month upon notification by the Village Hydrologist that due to
the size of the water supply system and the size of the community served by the
system that a greater frequency is required. Further, any water supply system
based entirely or partly on open service water reservoirs are hereby required
to carry out daily tests of turbidity.
   (b)   All central water systems shall further provide testing for inorganic
components, organic chemicals and radioactive nuclides as established in the

    (c)    All testing and monitoring as required by this chapter shall be
performed by any existing central water system upon the effective date of this
section and any new central water system, upon commencement of service, shall
comply with this chapter.
(Ord. 1983-17. Passed 3-14-83. )
1028.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any section of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the third degree. Any person, firm or other entity who violates this chapter
shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) nor imprisoned more
than sixty days for a first offense. Any subsequent conviction for a violation
of any section of this chapter shall be a misdemeanor of the first degree. Any
person, firm or entity who violates this ordinance shall upon subsequent
conviction thereof be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) nor
imprisoned more than six months. Each day such violation continues shall be
considered a separate offense. Nothing in this section shall prevent the
Municipality from taking such other legal or equitable action necessary to
prevent or remedy a violation or to avoid any harm to the consumers of any
central water system within the Village.

this regulation, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of an
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
regulation or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, the Village of South Russell may seek issuance of a search
warrant, civil remedies including but not limited to injunctive relief, and/or
criminal remedies from any court of appropriate jurisdiction.

required, the Notice of Violation shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said Notice shall further advise
that, should the facility owner/operator fail to remediate or restore within
the established deadline, a legal action for enforcement may be initiated.
   (c)   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation must meet compliance
standards within the time established in the Notice of Violation.

   Provisions of this Code shall be considered minimum requirements and shall
be construed to further its underlying purpose and objectives. They shall apply
uniformly to each district, lot and structure. Where provisions of this Code

such a permit or certificate be issued and be in conflict with this Code, it
shall be deemed null and void.
1.10 SEPARABILITY.
   Should any provision of this Code be declared invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the Code
other than the provision declared to be invalid nor shall such decision affect
the application of any provision to different facts or circumstances.
1.11 TEMPORARY USES.
   Temporary living space or space used until a dwelling is completed,
including basements, garages, or mobile homes, shall not be permitted in any

3.02 (RESERVED)
3.03 DIRECTOR OF TRANSPORTATION REVIEW.
   No application for a zoning permit involving land within 300 feet of the
centerline of a certified, proposed new or altered state highway, or within 500
feet of the point of intersection of such centerline with any other street,
shall be approved by the Zoning Inspector prior to review by the State Director
of Transportation according to the following procedure.
   (a)   Referral: Within five working days after receipt of a completed
application for a zoning permit the Zoning Inspector shall forward a copy
thereof to the Director.
   (b)   Review: If within 120 days after the date of referral the Director
notifies the municipality that land acquisition shall proceed, the application
shall be disapproved. If the Director notifies the municipality that land
acquisition shall not proceed, or upon the expiration of 120 days, the Zoning
Inspector may approve the application.
3.04 DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL.
   (a)   (1)   Other than as to the exception set out in division (a)(2) of
this section, no application for a zoning permit involving a multi-family
residential, private cluster residential development, or envelope, residential
neighborhood, elderly assisted living facility, any one-family structure
exceeding thirty feet maximum height and not requiring a variance, business or
industrial structure or use, or any property located in a groundwater sensitive
zone in which the applicant seeks to develop the property and the future
occupants potable water needs will be supplied by using groundwater from the
property, shall be approved by the Zoning Inspector prior to approval by the
Commission according to the following procedure and development regulation of
this Code. (Amended by Ord. No. 1993-37, passed 8-16-93)
      (2)   A.   Where there has been a change of occupancy only, in all or a
portion of a structure in a business or industrial district, and there has been
no change in the use of said structure or relevant portion thereof, nor any
erection or enlargement of said structure, then the Planning Commission review
is not necessary and the Zoning Inspector may issue the zoning permit without
prior Commission approval.
         B.   Where a zoning permit has already been issued for a "residential
neighborhood" development, the Zoning Inspector may thereafter issue any
required zoning permits without prior Commission review or approval.
   (b)   Application: Applications for development approval shall include the
following data:
      (1)   One copy of Form Z-1 completed by the applicant and Zoning
Inspector and required data specified thereon.
      (2)   The fee specified on Schedule 1.
   (c)   Review: Upon receipt of a completed application the Secretary shall
forward a copy to the Engineer and place it on the agenda of the next regular
Commission meeting. The filing date of the application shall be the date of
this meeting. The Planning Commission may defer action, as set forth in
division (d) of this section, upon such application, until the date of the next
regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting, but in no event later than
forty days after the filing date, unless the applicant agrees to a further
extension of time for Planning Commission action.
   (d)   Action: Following a review of the application and reports thereon, the
Commission shall within the time limit as set forth in paragraph (c) approve,
conditionally approve or disapprove the application. Within five business days
of the Commission action, the Secretary shall certify such Commission action,
including any conditions thereto on Form Z-l to the applicant and the Zoning
Inspector.
   (e)   Permit Issued: Unless specifically authorized otherwise by Planning
Commission, the applicant shall comply with all conditions imposed by any
permit prior to commencement of development where possible. Before a zoning
permit is issued, the Commission in its discretion may require a performance
bond in an amount determined by the engineer and in form approved by the
Solicitor which shall be placed with the municipality to assure that grading,
landscaping, paving, storm drainage and other improvements shall conform to the
approved development and all laws and regulations of the municipality.
   (f)   Review Standards: It shall be the duty of the Planning Commission to
investigate and ascertain if the plans for the development comply with the
following conditions, which conditions must be complied with by the applicant
in order to receive a zoning permit to develop their property:
      (1)   That the proposed development is harmonious with the Subdivision
Regulations, if applicable, of the Village of South Russell.
      (2)   That it will not adversely affect neighboring properties.
      (3)   That the plan of the development provides for integrated and
harmonious design of buildings and structures and for adequate and properly
arranged facilities for internal traffic circulation, off-street parking and
loading, landscaping and such other features and facilities as may be necessary
to make the project attractive and efficient from the standpoint of the
applicant as well as from the standpoint of the adjoining or surrounding,
existing or potential developments.
      (4)   That an adequate water supply sufficient for the reasonable needs
of the proposed development is available to the development without unduly
burdening the already existing water users in the vicinity or endangering the
water supply or recharge area of the Village. There are hereby created
groundwater sensitive zones in the undeveloped and under developed portions of
the municipality known as The Two Acre Groundwater Zone (GW-2), The Three Acre
Groundwater Zone (GW-3), The Four Acre Groundwater Zone (GW-4) and The Five
Acre Groundwater Zone (GW-5) as designated on the map hereinafter described.
Said zones are created in areas where further development of the land is
possible and where the potential development may adversely affect the available
groundwater for the present and future consumers of the groundwater. Any
property located in a groundwater sensitive zone shall be developed in
accordance with the minimum lot area requirements of such zone which are
displayed and set forth in the Groundwater Sensitive Zone Map dated September
1, 1988 and as may be amended from time to time, which shall be on file and
maintained at the office of the Village Clerk. If any parcel of land is located
in more than one zone, the minimum lot area for the entire parcel shall be the
larger minimum lot area of the zones unless the Commission finds that the
proposed use of the parcel of land can be located in such a fashion as to
utilize the groundwater in a less restrictive zone. In such event, the less
restrictive zone shall govern. However, the Commission, upon the applicant's
request, may permit development in accordance with the minimum lot area
requirements set forth in Section 4.02, 5.02, 6.02 and 7.02 when presented with
evidence satisfactory to the Commission the groundwater conditions located on
and under the proposed development are adequate to service the future occupants
of the proposed development without adversely affecting the rights of other
consumers of the groundwater contained in the same aquifer(s), considering the
density allowances of Section 4.02, 5.02, 6.02 and 7.02 or that the proposed
development will be serviced by a municipal or county water distribution system
adequate to service such needs. If the Commission determines that the services
of a hydrogeologist or hydrologist are needed to advise the Commission, the
Commission may hire such person or firm at the cost of the applicant. If the
applicant intends to obtain water from a public water supply for the proposed
development, the entire cost of providing the improvements to the municipal or
county water distributing system shall be borne by the applicant. In the event
the applicant intends to use the groundwater as the potable water supply, and
the Commission determined the groundwater conditions permit minimum lot areas
smaller than permitted by the Groundwater Sensitive Zone Map on any part or all
of the proposed development but larger than the minimum lot area permitted in
Sections 4.02, 5.02, 6.02 and 7.02, the Commission may permit minimum lot areas
on any part or all of the proposed development to be compatible with the
groundwater capabilities but not less than those set forth in the pertinent
regulation found in Sections 4.02, 5.02, 6.02 and 7.02. Density allowance for
the purpose of this division shall mean minimum lot area requirements of the
Village Zoning Code. (Ord. 1988-59, adopted October 24, 1988; Ord. 2001-19.)
   (g)   Expenses of Inspection or Investigation for Compliance: The applicant
shall be responsible for all expenses incurred by the Village for engineering,
legal, and other costs of experts arising from any inspection and/or
investigation reasonably necessary for the Village to assure compliance with
any developmental approval or to determine whether or not any Village action is
required prior to the expiration of any performance bond issued pursuant to
division (d) of this section.
(Ord. 2022-66. Passed 8-8-22; Ord. 2024-57. Passed 5-13-24.)
3.05 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   No conditional use specified in this Code shall be established prior to the
issuance of conditional use permit by the Zoning Inspector according to the
following procedure and conditional use regulations of this Code.
   (a)   Application: Applications for conditional use permits shall include
the following data:
      (1)   One copy of Form Z-1 and Z-3 or Z-3-A completed by the applicant
and required data specified thereon.
      (2)   The fee specified on Schedule 1.
   (b)   Review & Hearing: Upon receipt of a completed application the
Secretary shall place the application on the agenda of the next regular
Commission meeting. The filing date of the application shall be the date of
this meeting. At such meeting the Commission shall schedule a public hearing
within sixty days thereafter. Notice shall be given in at least one publication
of a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality and mailed by the
Secretary to the applicant and property owners contiguous to and across the
street from the lot involved at least twenty days before the hearing. Failure
to deliver such notice, however, shall not invalidate any Commission action.
(Ord. 2001-19.)
   (c)   Action: Within 35 days after the public hearing, or continuations
thereof, the Commission shall approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the
application. Within five business days of the Commission action, the Secretary
shall certify such Commission action, including any conditions thereto, on Form
Z-3 or Z-3-A and one copy shall be returned to the applicant and one copy
forwarded to the Zoning Inspector.
   (d)   Permit Issued: Unless specifically authorized by Planning Commission,
the applicant shall comply with all conditions imposed by any permit prior to
commencement of development. Such permit shall authorize only one conditional
use and shall become void if all work is not started within 180 days and is not
completed within one year after the date of issuance unless an extension is
obtained from the Commission or if the conditional use ceases for more than 180
days. Before a zoning permit is issued, the Commission in its discretion may
require a performance bond in an amount determined by the Engineer and in form
approved by the Solicitor which shall be placed with the municipality to assure
that grading, landscaping, paving, storm drainage, and other improvements shall
conform to the approved development and all laws and regulations of the
municipality and other conditions for which a performance bond is appropriate
and have been required by the Commission.
(Ord. 2022-66. Passed 8-8-22; Ord. 2024-58. Passed 5-13-24.)
3.06 AMENDMENTS.
   Whenever the public necessity, general welfare or good zoning practice
require, Council may, after receipt of a Commission recommendation amend or
repeal any provision of this Code. Amendments may be initiated by Council or
the Commission or by property owner within the area to be changed or affected
by the amendment according to the following procedure.
   (a)   (1)   If initiated by Council, Clerk shall forward a copy of the
proposed amendment to the Secretary who shall place it on the agenda of the
next regular Commission meeting.
      (2)   If initiated by a property owner, the Secretary shall place the
proposed amendment on the next regularly-scheduled Planning Commission meeting
provided the property owner has submitted to the Secretary:
         A.   One copy of the Form Z-5 completed by the applicant and required
data specified thereon.
         B.   The fee specified on Schedule 1. In the event the actual cost and
fees exceeds the amount of the fee, the applicant shall pay such additional
costs and fees to the Clerk upon receipt of an invoice for such additional fees
or costs and no amendment shall be adopted until the same has been paid to the
municipality. The Zoning Map, certified by the Commission Chairman and
Secretary, shall be on file in the Village Building Department and/or with the
Village records and no change thereon shall be made without legislative
authority. (Ord. 2001-19.)
      (3)   In all cases, the filing date of the proposed amendment shall be
the date when it first appears on the agenda.
   (b)   Director of Transportation Review: If the proposed amendment involves
land within 300 feet of the centerline of a certified proposed new or altered
state highway, or within 500 feet of the point of intersection of such
centerline with any other street, the Secretary shall forward a copy to the
State Director of Transportation. The Commission may thereafter proceed to act
on the amendment, but Council shall not approve it for 120 days after referral
to the Director. If during this period the Director notifies the municipality
that land acquisition shall proceed, Council shall deny the amendment. If the
Director notifies the municipality that land acquisition shall not proceed or
upon the expiration of 120 days, Council may approve the amendment.
   (c)   Recommendation: The Commission may hold a public hearing within thirty
days after the filing date of the proposed amendment by giving notice on Form
Z-4 and at least one publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the
municipality at least ten days before such hearing. Form Z-4 shall also be
mailed by the Secretary at least ten days before the hearing to the applicant
and property owners within, contiguous to, and across the street from any lot
of record involved in an amendment to this Code. The proponent of the amendment
may require the Commission to recommend approval or disapproval of the
amendment exactly as proposed or may consent to modifications of the amendment
recommended by the Commission or may request the Commission to recommend
approval of an amendment with modifications agreed to and those not consented
to by the proponent. Within fifteen days after the hearing or forty-five days
after the filing date if no hearing is held, the Commission shall recommend
approval, disapproval, or modification of the amendment. Commission action
including any conditions thereto shall be certified by the Secretary on Form Z-
5 and shall return one to the property owner and forward one to the Clerk.
   (d)   Council Hearing: Upon receipt of the Commission recommendation, the
Clerk shall place the proposed amendment on the agenda of the next regular
Council meeting. At such meeting Council shall schedule a public hearing giving
thirty days notice thereafter. Notice of the hearing on Form Z-4 shall be given
in at least one publication of a newspaper of general circulation in the
municipality at least thirty days before such hearing. If the amendment
involves rezoning or redistricting of ten or less parcels listed on a tax
duplicate, Form Z-4 shall also be mailed by the Clerk at least thirty days
before the hearing to property owners within, contiguous to or across the
street from the area involved.
   (e)   Council Action: Within thirty days after the completion of the
required readings, or any waiver thereof, Council shall by ordinance adopt,
modify or deny the amendment. No Council action however, shall overrule a
Commission recommendation except by an affirmative vote of three-fourths of the
Council members.
(Ord. 2022-66. Passed 8-8-22.)
3.07 APPEALS.
   The Board shall hear and determine any question or dispute involving the
interpretation of the provisions of this Code and may grant variances (other
than as to the height of any residential dwelling) according to the following
procedure, standards and criteria. The Planning Commission shall hear and
determine any variance to the maximum height regulations of Chapter 4 according
to the following procedure, standards and criteria. Any party adversely
affected may file an appeal to the Board from any administrative action
including the granting or denial of a zoning permit or occupancy permit,
however, the Board shall not hear appeals from any final decision of the
Commission requesting a variance to the maximum height regulations of Chapter
4. (Amended by Ord. No. 1993-37, passed 8-16-93)
   (a)   Application: Applications shall be filed with the Secretary within
twenty days after the date of any action to be appealed from and shall include
the following data:
      (1)   One copy of Form Z-6 completed by the applicant.
      (2)   The fee specified on Schedule 1. In the event the actual cost and
fees exceeds the amount of the fee, the applicant shall pay such additional
costs and fees to the Clerk upon receipt of an invoice for such additional fees
or costs and no permit shall be issued until the same has been paid to the
municipality. (Ord. 2001-19.)
   (b)   Review & Hearing: Upon receipt of a complete application, the
Secretary shall notify the Chairman of the Board, or the Commission as to
residential height variances, who shall schedule a public hearing within
thirty-five days of the filing date of the application. Notice of the hearing
on Form Z-4 shall be given at least one publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in the municipality at least ten days before such hearing. Form Z-
4 shall be mailed by the Secretary of the Board, or the Commission, as the case
may be, at least ten days before the hearing to the applicant and property
owners contiguous to and/or across the street from, and all others within 250
feet of any yard of the property involved. Failure to deliver such notice,
however, shall not invalidate any Board or Commission action. (Amended by Ord.
No. 1993-37, passed 8-16-93.)
   (c)   Action: Within 35 days after the public hearing, the Board, or the
Commission, as the case may be, shall approve, conditionally approve or
disapprove the application. Board or Commission action, including any
conditions thereto, shall be certified by the Secretary on Form Z-6 within five
business days of the approval of the meeting minutes of the Board or Commission
action and one copy shall be returned to the applicant and one forwarded to the
Zoning Inspector. Any rights obtained by variance and any permit issued shall
become void if such permit would become void under Section 3.01(d). In
determining whether or not an application for a height variance should be
approved, the Commission shall be guided by the provisions of Section 4.02 and
divisions (c)(l), (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section. In determining
whether or not the application should be approved, conditionally approved, or
disapproved, the action of the Board shall be based on the following standards
and criteria: (Amended by Ord. No. 1993-37, passed 8-16-93.)
      (1)   Variances to use regulations may be granted only to the following
extent:
         A.   The property cannot be used for any permitted use within the
district;
         B.   The variance would not be detrimental to the public welfare or
injurious to the property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the
property is located; and
         C.   The variance shall be the minimum necessary in order to provide
adequate relief to the property owner.
      (2)   Where the appellant seeks a variance pertaining to an area
requirement otherwise applicable to the property, no variance may be granted
unless the appellant has demonstrated the literal enforcement of the provisions
or requirements of the Zoning Code pertaining to area requirements would cause
the appellant practical difficulties. The factors to be considered and weighed
in determining whether an appellant seeking an area variance has encountered
practical difficulties in the proposed use of his property include, but are not
limited to:
         A.   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return
or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
         B.   Whether the variance is substantial;
         C.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
         D.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e. g., water, sewer, garbage);
         E.   Whether the appellant purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restrictions;
         F.   Whether the appellant's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
         G.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
      (3)   Where the Board has determined that literal enforcement of the
requirements of the Zoning Code would involve practical difficulties or would
cause undue hardship, unnecessary to cany out the spirit and purpose of the
Zoning Code, the Board shall have power to authorize a variance from such
strict application so as to relieve such hardship or practical difficulties so
that the spirit and purpose of the Zoning Code shall be observed and
substantial justice done. In authorizing a variance the Board may attach
thereto such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of
the proposed stmcture or use as it deems necessary in the interest of the
furtherance of the purpose of the Zoning Code and in the public interest. In
authorizing a variance with attached conditions the Board shall require such
evidence and guaranty or bond as it may deem to be necessary to ensure that the
conditions attached are being and will be complied with.
      (4)   No such variance in the provisions or requirements of the Zoning
Code shall be authorized by the Board unless the Board finds that the
authorizing of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent
property and will not materially impair the purposes of the Zoning Code or the
public interest. (Ord. 2001-19.)
      (5)   Variances to area regulations may be granted only to the following
extent:
         A.   A lot of record held in single and separate ownership on the
effective date of this Code may be used as a site for a single-family dwelling
as provided for in the Code, provided the owner cannot acquire at a reasonable
cost additional vacant land adjoining the lot.
         B.   The Board may vary minimum floor area regulations of dwellings,
but by no more than ten percent, if by reason of conformance to lot frontage,
area or yards specified in the Code, or by exceptionally skillful arrangement
of site design, the result of such a variance would be in harmony with the
character of the neighborhood.
      (6)   Variances to yard regulations may be granted only to the following
extent:
         A.   The Board may permit as may be necessary for the appropriate
development of a lot, or because of peculiar shape or topographical reasons,
variances to the required yards, provided light and ventilation will be
adequate, and privacy will not be impaired, and provided the owner cannot
acquire at a reasonable cost additional vacant land adjoining the lot.
         B.   The Board may permit a modification of required side yard so as
to allow a garage to be attached to a one-family dwelling constructed before
the effective date of this Code to project into a required side yard, providing
the resulting side yard is not less than five feet and further providing that
the distance to a building or structure on the adjoining lot is greater than
ten feet.
      (7)   The Board may permit an increase in height of a proposed or
existing structure or part thereof to the same height as adjacent structures,
except the Board may not grant any increases in height to any residential
dwellings permitted in Chapter 4. (Amended by Ord. No. 1993-37, passed 8-16-
93.)
      (8)   Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to prohibit any municipal
official from appealing to the appropriate court from any Board decision.
      (9)   In the event the Board grants a variance, in so doing the Board
shall in writing specify the findings of facts in support of such a variance.
   (d)   Decisions of the Board shall be final within the municipality, except
that an appeal therefrom may be taken to the Court of Common Pleas for Geauga
County in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio, by any proper and
interested party, including the municipality. A notice of appeal shall be filed
with the Secretary of the Board. (Added by Ord. No. 1992-46, passed 9-14-92.)
      (Ord. 2016-18. Passed 6-22-16; Ord. 2022-66. Passed 8-8-22; Ord. 2024-60.
Passed 5-13-24.)
3.08 VIOLATIONS.
   Failure to obtain permits specified in this Code or comply with any other
provisions of the Code shall constitute a violation. Any person may file a
complaint in regard to an alleged violation. All such complaints shall be in
writing and shall be filed with the Zoning Inspector, who shall record and
investigate such complaints. If the Zoning Inspector finds a violation, he
shall notify the person responsible on Form Z-7 and take further action as
directed by the Solicitor which may include the revocation of a permit on Form
Z-8 or ordering the discontinuance of the violation.
3.09 PENALTIES.
   A violation of this Code shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who
violates the Code or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon
conviction thereof be fined not more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
or imprisoned for not more than thirty days, or both. Each day such violation
continues after notification thereof shall be considered a separate offense.
The owner or tenant of any structure, premises or part thereof, and any
architect, builder, developer, agent or other person who commits, participates
in or maintains such violation may each be found guilty of a separate offense
and suffer the penalties herein provided. Nothing in this Code shall prevent
the municipality from taking such other lawful action necessary to prevent or
remedy a violation. Any person who violates the provisions of Chapter 7 or
fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be
subject to fines and penalties set forth in Section
7.02.
3.10 FEES.
   Fees specified on Schedule 1 shall be paid by the applicant to the
municipality before the applicable application is processed. Prior to making
application for a conditional use permit, development approval, zoning
amendment or variance the applicant shall pay the fee specified on Schedule 1
with the Clerk to cover advertising costs, court reporter fees, other recording
fees, legal fees, engineering and hydrology fees, other expert fees necessary
to review the proposed development and all other administrative costs and
review fees. No zoning permit shall be issued until all such costs and fees
incurred are paid to the municipality.
(Ord. 2022-66. Passed 8-8-22.)
3.11 EFFECTIVE APPROVAL.
   Except for administrative appeals or variances granted by the Board of
Zoning Appeals, approvals from the Board or Commission granted under Chapter 3
of the Zoning Code shall expire within 12 months if the use authorized by the
approval is not established or the work authorized by the approval has not
materially commenced unless otherwise provided by the Board or Commission. Upon
a reasonable request for an extension accompanied by an additional fee of
twenty-five dollars ($25.00), the Board or Commission, may, in its respective
discretion, extend the date of its effective approval.

structures shall not be erected or used in any manner that would cause hazards
or annoyance to the public generally or to the occupants of adjacent property.
Permanent outside fireplaces, sheds or other enclosed structures are permitted
provided the total floor area of all such structures on a lot does not exceed
500 square feet per acre of land on said lot.
      (2)   Home occupations: Home occupations may be permitted in a dwelling
unit, provided:
         A.   No more than one assistant, other than other members of the

         C.   No sale of food or beverage, motorized vehicles or equipment
shall be permitted nor shall laundries be permitted, nor shall the repair of
motorized vehicles or equipment be permitted nor shall the production or
assembly of products or goods be permitted, it being the intent to limit home
occupations to those uses which are generally service oriented such as
architects, engineers, attorneys, sales representatives, insurance agents, as
encompassed in the definition of limited offices set forth in Section
2.01. No occupational use shall be approved unless similar in use and nature to
those specifically permitted by this section and which comply with all
provisions of this division (b)(2). Anything sold or offered for sale shall be
limited to that resulting from conduct of the home occupation. (Ord. 2001-19.)
         D.   No equipment is used which would create any dust, noise, odor,
glare, vibrations, electrical disturbances, or interfere with the occupancy of
neighboring residential property or the character of the neighborhood,
including radio, telephone, television or cable television reception and
electric line voltage fluctuations beyond the lot, nor shall any use be engaged
in, in which the use of hazardous chemicals or substance are used in the home
occupation.
         E.   The use does not attract any greater number of automobiles at any
one time than three nor more than ten in any one day, other than those owned
and used by the people residing in the dwelling unit and the one possible

         H.   No home occupation shall be engaged in where any portion of the
activity takes place other than inside the dwelling unit.
         I.   More than one occupant of the dwelling unit may engage in a home
occupation, so long as the total square footage devoted to the home occupations
of all occupants does not exceed 300 square feet of the dwelling unit.
         J.   A sign shall be limited to those permitted in residential
district.
         K.   Home occupations shall conform with the performance regulations
of this Code.
         L.   The home occupation must be clearly incidental to the main use of
the dwelling unit which is the primary residence of the persons engaged in the
home occupation, with the exception of one assistant who may reside elsewhere
and who does not own any portion of the home occupation being engaged in by the
residents of the dwelling unit. (Amended by Ord. No. 1994-54, passed 11-14-94.)
      (3)   Rented rooms: Not more than one room may be rented by the resident
family in a dwelling unit to not more than one person, provided:

         C.   Such occupancy complies with all other applicable municipal,
county and state law.
      (4)   Fences:
         A.   Fences may be permitted along the side or rear lot lines (set
back at least three feet from the actual boundary line), provided at least
twenty-five percent of the vertical surface is open to light and air. Such
fences are permitted to a height not exceeding six feet above the finished
grade, except for fences along the side lot lines which run between the street
and the front line of the residential structure, which shall not exceed three
feet in height. However, split-rail fences along such front side lines are
permitted to a maximum height of four feet. (For purposes of this section,
"boundary line" shall mean the outside perimeter line of property as set forth
in the legal description contained in the deed for such property, except for
property held in condominium ownership or in a private cluster residential
development, where "boundary line" shall mean the outside perimeter line of the
then existing common area of either the condominium development where such
individual condominium is situated or the private cluster residential
development where such single-family detached dwelling is located.) (Amended by
Ord. 1992-9, passed 02-24-92.)
         B.   No fences are permitted along front lot lines with the exception
of split rail fences which shall not exceed four feet in height.
         C.   All fences shall be of uniform design and well maintained.

arranged as to deflect light away from adjoining property.
      (9)   No mobile home or manufactured home shall be placed, installed,
constructed, located on or occupied in a residential district. A mobile home,
for the purpose of this division, shall mean a structure, transportable in one
or more sections, which is built on a chassis or is designed to be built on a
chassis, and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent
foundation. A manufactured home shall be defined, for the purpose of this
division, as a manufactured home is defined in Section 5402(6), Title 42, U.S.
Code and R.C. § 4501.01(MM). A manufactured home also means a structure for
which a certification, as described in Section 5415, Title 42, U.S. Code, has
been furnished or fixed in the form of a label or tag, whether or not such
label or tag has been removed. A structure is a mobile home whether or not
axles, chassis, hitches, wheels or other appurtenances of mobility have been
removed and regardless of the nature of the foundation provided. A mobile home
and/or a manufactured home shall not be defined to include an industrialized
unit as defined in R.C. § 3781.10 for which a letter of certification and
insignia have been issued by the Ohio Board of Building Standards pursuant to
Ohio Administrative Code 4101:2-1-62(A). (Ord. 1989-1, adopted January 9,
1989.)
   (c)   Temporary Structures: Temporary structures for construction
operations, including field offices, storage of materials, and workshops for
assembly of components, may be permitted on undeveloped lots, if such
structures are found necessary for the construction operations for which a
building permit has been issued, provided such temporary structures shall be
located at least 200 feet from the nearest occupied residential dwelling and
shall be removed within thirty days after the completion or discontinuance of
the work.
   (d)   Soil Removal: Soil, sand or gravel shall not be stripped or removed in
any district except in conformity with the requirements of Chapter 1466,
Erosion and Sediment Control of the Codified Ordinances for the Village of
South Russell.

         I.   No more than one recreational vehicle per premise may so be
parked.
         J.   A recreational vehicle parked or stored outdoors must be
adequately screened, if visible from any adjoining premises, as approved by the
Building Inspector.
(Ord. 2011-29. Passed 8-8-11; Ord. 2013-32. Passed 8-12-13.)
4.02 AREA, YARD AND HEIGHT REGULATIONS.
   In residential districts, structures and land shall be used, and structures
shall be erected, altered or moved in whole or in part, only according to the
following chart and regulations:
   (a)   Maintenance of Lot Area and Width: A parcel of land may be divided
into two or more lots, provided all lots resulting from such division conform
to all lot area and width regulations of the district in which it is located. A
lot of record, whether vacant or occupied by a structure, which has an area or
width equal to, or less than required by this Code, and which was owned
separately from adjoining lots on the effective date of this Code, shall not be
further reduced in any manner. The required lot area which is provided for a
dwelling or other use shall not be considered as providing any part of the
required lot area for another dwelling or use.
   (b)   Lots of Insufficient Area or Width: A lot of record which does not
comply with the lot area or width regulations of the district in which it is
located on the effective date of this Code shall be non-conforming and may be
used as set forth in other provisions of this Code.
   (c)   Maintenance of Yard Dimensions: The required yards surrounding a
structure shall not be separated in ownership from the part of the lot upon
which the structure is located, and no part of a required yard shall be
considered as providing a yard for any other existing structure. A yard shall
not be reduced to less than the required dimensions for the district in which
it is located and a yard of less than the required width shall not be further
reduced unless authorized by other provisions of this Code. Every required yard
shall be open and unobstructed from the ground upward.
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS

(Ord. 1993-97, adopted August 16-1993.)
   (d)   Front Yards in Partially Built-Up Blocks: Where a building line has
not been established by a map or ordinance, and where fifty percent or more of
the aggregate street frontage between two successive intersecting streets or in
an intersecting street and its terminal point is occupied by structures of the
type and use permitted in the district before the effective date of this Code,
the minimum front yard for new structures shall be the same as existing
structures located within 150 feet on either side of a given lot, provided the
depth of the front yard resulting therefrom shall be not less than one-half the
dimension given on the chart set out above.
   (e)   Yards of Corner Lots: The depth of the front yard and side yard
fronting on the side street of a corner lot shall be not less than the required
setback from the front lot line given on the chart set out above, unless shown
otherwise on the Zoning Map. The interior side yard and rear yard of a corner
lot shall be not less than given on the chart set out above.
   (f)   Accessory Structures: Other than fences as set forth in Section
4.01 (b)(4), accessory structures permitted in residential districts shall not
project into a front yard. Accessory structures may be located in side or rear
yards according to the chart set out above. On corner lots accessory structures
shall be set back from the side street line a distance not less than the
setback required for the main use, plus five feet. No accessory structure shall
be erected or set upon a lot prior to erection of the main structure on the lot
or commencement of the main use on the lot.
   (g)   Two-Family, Multi-family, Private Cluster Residential Development, and
Elderly Assisted Living Yard Regulations: In order to encourage flexibility in
design, more attractive arrangements of buildings and greater utilization of
open space, yards of two-family, multi-family buildings, private cluster
residential development, and elderly assisted living buildings shall be related
to the space within the development and be arranged so as to assure privacy
between adjacent buildings, streets, parking and open spaces according to the
following regulations: (Amended by Ord. 1992-9, passed 2-24-92.)
      (1)   The terms used in this section are defined as follows:
         A.   Single development: Development of one multi-family building,
elderly assisted living building, or one detached single-family dwelling in a
private cluster residential development on one lot or envelope coordinated with
the surrounding neighborhood and fronting on a dedicated street, or, in the
case of a private cluster residential development, on a spur road.
         B.   Group development: Development of more than one multi-family
building, elderly assisted living building, or detached single-family dwelling
in a private cluster residential development, on a lot or on envelopes planned
as a unit or cluster and coordinated with the surrounding neighborhood.
         C.   Main wall: Any exterior wall of a multi-family building or
detached single-family dwelling in a private cluster residential development
containing the principle windows of living, dining or sleeping rooms.
         D.   End or secondary wall: Any exterior wall of a multi-family
building, elderly assisted living building, or detached single-family dwelling
in a private cluster residential development, other than a main wall.
         E.   Overlapping walls: That portion of exterior walls which is
directly opposite two buildings, which are parallel or within thirty degrees of
being parallel.
      (2)   The distance between facing and overlapping buildings or parts
thereof, in a group development shall vary in direct relation to the length and
height of buildings. Such distance shall be determined by the formula:
               Minimum Distance = LA + LB + HA + HB
                            F
         The elements of the formula are defined as follows:
         A.   "Minimum distance": The required minimum horizontal distance
between any wall of building "A" and the nearest wall of building "B" or the
vertical prolongation of either.
         B.   "LA": The total length of building "A" which is the maximum
length of the portion of portions of any wall or walls from which lines drawn
perpendicular to the face of such wall or walls will intersect any wall of
building "B", or boundary line.
         C.   "LB": The total length of building "B" which, is defined as the
maximum length of the portion or portions of any wall or walls from which lines
drawn perpendicular to the face of such wall or walls will intersect any wall
of building "A".
         D.   "HA": The height of building "A".
         E.   "HB": The height of building "B".
         F.   "F": The divisor which is "4", provided, the minimum distance
between main walls of facing and overlapping buildings or yards shall not be
less than fifty feet.
      (3)   The distance between angular arrangements of 30° to 60° shall be
determined by the formula:
               Minimum Distance = 2LB + HA + HB - K
                            F
         The elements of this formula are the same as previously defined,
except that the term "K" is the sine of a 2n where "n" is the angle from
building "B" to building "A" or extension thereof, and "n" is:
            30° to 34° minus K = 10'
            35° to 39° minus K = 20'
            40° to 50° minus K = 25'
            51° to 55° minus K = 20'
            56° to 60° minus K = 10'
      (4)   The distances between walls of court arrangements shall be
determined by applying the formula of this section to each set of facing walls.
      (5)   Where the walls of two buildings do not directly face each other or
do not overlap--this is, where lines drawn perpendicular from the face of any
wall of one building will not intersect the face of any wall of another
building--the minimum horizontal distance between such buildings shall not be
less than one-half of the combined height of the two buildings. Such distances
shall be determined by the formula:
               Minimum Distance = HA + HB
                         2
         The elements of this formula are the same as previously defined.
      (6)   The distance between building and boundary lines of a multi-family
building, elderly assisted living building, or a single-family detached
dwelling in a private cluster residential development, in a single development
or group development, and any front, side or rear lot line shall vary in direct
relation to the length and height of the building. Such minimum distance shall
be as determined by the formula:
               Minimum Distance = 2 LA + HA
                         F
         The elements of this formula are the same as previously defined.
(Amended by Ord. 1992-9, passed 2-24-92.)
      (7)   Use and design of required yards, set forth in this chapter, shall
be landscaped and may be used for pedestrian walks and passive recreation
areas. If yards between buildings are used for parking areas, driveways or
playgrounds, the distance between buildings shall be increased by the
dimensions of such intermediary facilities. All dwellings shall be located not
more than 200 feet from parking areas, the distance to be measured along
pedestrian walks. Yards not occupied by any accessory building or use shall be
fully landscaped.
      (8)   Except for single-family detached dwellings located in a private
cluster residential development, the yard regulations and lot area size set
forth for R-2 Districts in this chapter and in Section 4.02(g) may be reduced,
upon approval of the Commission, in accordance with certain standards set forth
herein, when property located in such district is developed as a single-family
detached dwelling, platted subdivision, so long as said sublots maintain a lot
width at the building set-back line intersecting at each side yard line of at
least 100 feet, and so long as the minimum distance between residential
structures is thirty feet and maintain a minimum side yard of ten feet and the
minimum set-back from the right-of-way to any structure is fifty feet. The
reduction for each sublot shall be the minimum necessary to carry out the
intent of the municipality to encourage single- family detached structures, in
Multi-Family Districts, and shall only be granted where, due to topographical
features of the land, inadequate drainage of the land, adverse effects of
public utility transmission lines, and soil conditions the subdivision cannot
be laid out in accordance with Section 4.02. The Commission may grant such
reductions at the time of submission of a final plat in accordance with the
subdivision regulations of the municipality. Only such sublots as are the
minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of this section, shall be reduced. In
no event shall the Commission allow the reduction to create greater density
than permitted by Section 4.02 nor shall any sublot be located other than upon
a dedicated public roadway, improved in accordance with the improvement
standards of the municipality. (Amended by Ord. 1992-9, passed 2-24-92.)
            In a private cluster residential development, the Commission may
modify the formulas set forth in Section 4.02(g) to permit dwellings to have a
minimum front yard, as measured from the edge of the improved, paved portion of
a spur road to the front wall of the dwelling, of twenty-five feet and to
permit dwellings to maintain a minimum distance of the greater of twenty-five
feet from each other, or the height of the highest dwelling subject to
measurement, where the Commission finds that such reductions will not adversely
affect the health, safety, or general welfare of the future residents of the
development, surrounding property and the Village as a whole and where such
reductions are compelled by unique characteristics located on site, such as
protected wetlands and recharge areas for groundwater supplies providing a
potable water supply to residents in the area of the aquifer. Such finding and
reduction shall be made at the time the private cluster residential development
is submitted for preliminary plat review or if there is no preliminary plat
submitted, at the time of final plat review. No public hearing shall be
required, before such reductions are granted, but the Commission shall cause
the developer to provide notice of any request for reductions of front yards or
distance between dwellings to all property owners contiguous, adjacent or
across the street from the property which is proposed for private cluster
residential development. (Amended by Ord. No. 1992-9, passed 02-24-92.)
   (h)   Residential Neighborhood Developments. In order to encourage
flexibility in design, greater utilization of open space, and to preserve the
remaining green areas and open areas of the Village and to promote the
development of large common areas for recreation and green areas, land may be
used in accordance with a residential neighborhood development plan approved by
the Planning Commission which plan shall meet the following minimum
requirements, and said developments shall be used in residential neighborhood
districts designated as RN Districts.
      (1)   The total area of land to be known as a development area shall
contain not less than 100 acres of contiguous land located wholly within the
Village of South Russell.
      (2)   The development area permissible is used exclusively for detached
one-family dwellings and accessory uses.
      (3)   Not less than twenty-five percent of the total development area is
reserved as common land for the benefit of the residents of the residential
neighborhood.
      (4)   Each sublot within the development area is at least three-quarter
acre in size.
      (5)   The density of the development is not greater than one one-family
dwelling per one and one-quarter acres of the total development area.
      (6)   The Commission shall give due consideration, in reviewing variances
to the subdivision regulations, to the flexibility of layout, contiguous
placement of common areas within the development and street lengths and
construction in order to carry out the interest of the Village in allowing
residential neighborhood development and not violate the spirit of the
subdivision regulations.
      (7)   The applicant shall provide for the formation of a homeowners
association of which each sublot owner shall be a member and shall share
proportionately the expenses of maintaining the common land for the common
benefit of all lot owners in such proportion as may be set forth in deed
restrictions, which deed restrictions shall run with the land, and which shall
be subject to approval by the Planning Commission of South Russell at the time
of development of the plan, and which shall further be subject to the approval
of the Planning Commission in the event that any amendment or change is made in
said deed restrictions by the applicant or homeowner.
      (8)   No residential neighborhood development plan shall be approved by
the Planning Commission unless the development area is serviced by a public
central sanitary sewer facility and no development of a residential
neighborhood shall occur unless each dwelling unit is serviced by said public
central sanitary sewer system. Unless the area is serviced by such sewer
facilities, said property shall be developed in accordance with one-family
dwelling regulations as set forth in the R-1-A District.
      (9)   No residential neighborhood development shall be approved by the
Planning Commission unless sufficient evidence is presented to the Planning
Commission that adequate groundwater exists within the development area to
service each dwelling unit with either private wells located on each sublot or
serviced by a central water system. Prior to Planning Commission approval, the
Village hydrologist shall review and recommend to the Planning Commission if
development should occur and the manner in which water should be provided to
residents of the residential neighborhood development. If the Planning
Commission determines there is inadequate groundwater, then any property within
the residential neighborhood district shall comply with one-family dwelling
regulations as otherwise set forth in the R-1-A District.
   (i)   Private Cluster Residential Development. In order to permit private
lot ownership in a residential development where detached one-family dwellings
are clustered on private spur roads for efficiency of accessibility, service,
design, and arrangement, while preserving commonly owned open spaces for
recreation, groundwater recharge, and privacy, land in an R-2 District may be
developed as a private cluster residential development in accordance with the
following standards and regulations:
      (1)   The total area of land known as a private cluster residential
development shall contain not less than fifty acres of contiguous property
located wholly within the Village of South Russell.
      (2)   The arrangement and spacing of the detached one-family dwellings in
said development shall be accomplished in accordance with the formula and
regulations set forth in Section 4.02(g).
      (3)   The development shall conform to the minimum and maximum dimensions
and density requirements set forth for a private cluster residential
development in the chart contained in Section 4.02.
      (4)   Such development may only be used for detached one-family dwellings
and accessory uses.
      (5)   Each one-family dwelling and all decks, attachments to the dwelling
and accessory buildings, to the extent permitted, shall be located entirely
within a platted, recorded, deeded tract of land, owned in fee simple, known as
an "envelope", whose dimensions, locations, size, and layout shall be subject
to Commission approval through the procedures set forth in the Village's
Subdivision Rules as if each envelope constituted an individual sublot in any
other residential subdivision. There shall be no minimum area size for a
particular envelope. The boundaries for each envelope shall be clearly marked
at every angle point by the developer with iron pins or other permanent
monuments in accordance with the Subdivision Rules. The angle points on the
back of the lots which abut the common area shall be marked with iron pins or
other permanent monuments prior to acceptance of dedication of any public roads
and prior to issuance of any building permits for the construction of
residences within the envelopes. The iron pins or other permanent monuments
shall be placed at each angle point of an envelope, which will have access only
from a dedicated street, on or before the date that acceptance of dedication of
the public road upon which said envelopes will have direct and exclusive access
will occur. As to the envelopes which will have access solely from spur roads,
each angle point of an envelope shall be marked by an iron pin or other
permanent monument on or before the date that the spur road is certified by the
Village Engineer as having been constructed in accordance with the development
review approval of the Commission and prior to the release of any performance
bond issued with respect to such spur road construction. Said envelopes shall
be arranged such that dwellings eventually built thereon will be able to meet
the formula requirements of Section 4.02(g) without the necessity of any zoning
variances. No envelope owner shall locate any improvement in the common land
other than water wells, as provided in division (i)(6) of this section.
      (6)   The developer shall provide for the formation of a homeowner's
association of which each envelope owner shall be a member and shall
proportionately split the expenses of maintaining, repairing and replacing (a)
the common land, (b) any spur roads and landscaping thereon, and (c) any
drainage improvements for the common benefit of all envelope owners in such
proportion as may be set forth in deed restrictions, which deed restrictions
shall run with the land, and which shall be subject to approval by the
Commission at the time the development plan is approved for subdivision by the
Commission. The deed restrictions shall provide for maintenance, repair,
replacement and additions to the water wells to be located in the envelopes or
on the common land, if required by the ordinances and rules and regulations of
the Village, which will provide a potable water supply from the underground
aquifers located within the development to the envelope owners as required by
the Village Hydrogeologist. The deed restrictions shall provide an easement of
at least ten feet across the side lines and rear line of each envelope for the
placement of water lines to permit envelope owners to lay and install,
maintain, repair and replace water lines to water wells that may be located on
common land which is not adjacent to the envelope which will be serviced by the
water well. Any private cluster residential development shall provide for
easements on the plat and in deed restrictions to appropriate public
authorities for installation, repair, replacement and maintenance of water,
sewer, and drainage easements when necessary for development or improvement of
adjacent properties to the private cluster residential development.
      (7)   The developer shall further provide permanent easements in favor of
each envelope owner to permit the construction, maintenance, repair,
replacement, and use of individual driveways and parking areas from the
dedicated streets and spur roads across common areas to individual dwellings
located on said envelopes. The individual driveways shall be either all asphalt
or all concrete material throughout the development. The developer shall
further provide easements of access for common, public use to all common land
areas within the development for the benefit of each envelope owner. The
development shall meet the open space requirements (except the open space can
be less than twenty-five feet from a dwelling) found in Section 4.05 and the
parking requirements set forth in Section 4.07.
      (8)   No dwellings shall be constructed without prior approval of
Commission and the Village's Architectural Board of Review in accordance with
the development review procedures set forth in Chapter Three and the provisions
of Chapter 260 of the Codified Ordinances of the Village. The Commission may
require the developer to provide appropriate grading and drainage of
surrounding and nearby envelopes and common areas when deemed necessary when
considering development review of any envelope for construction of a dwelling.
The grade plan for each envelope shall be prepared and delivered to the Village
by the engineer for the developer, regardless of who applies for development
review approval of any envelope(s).
      (9)   Any spur road within said development shall be subject to the
landscaping requirements set forth in Appendix C of the Village's Subdivision
Rules for Street Trees and Screening unless modifications are granted by the
Commission during subdivision or development review.
      (10)   Unless waived by the Commission, all improvements shall conform to
the requirements set forth in the Village's Subdivision Rules. (Added by Ord.
No. 1992-9, passed 2-24-92.)

         B.   In no event shall any single sign exceed thirty-six square feet,
unless approved by Planning Commission upon a showing by the applicant such
limitation unreasonably restricts the applicant's ability to communicate the
desired information, and that the proposed sign does not constitute a safety
hazard.
         C.   Moving signs shall not be permitted.
         D.   Sign areas shall be permitted in addition to the areas specified
above as follows:
            1.   Nameplates: Professional offices or service organizations

by the establishment or fifteen square feet, whichever is the smaller. Window
signs shall not exceed two square feet in area.
            2.   Conditional uses: The design and size of signs associated with

regulated by a conditional use permit.
            3.   Development signs: Temporary signs announcing a proposed

calendar year, with a minimum of thirty days of separation between each
temporary sign. Such temporary sign shall be in addition to the business’
permanent business signs, provided such temporary sign does not exceed fourteen
square feet in area; two sides are permitted. The purpose of this provision is
to discourage the practice of temporary signage being used on a quasi-permanent
basis and to limit the privilege of a temporary sign to its intended relatively
brief period of time.
      (3)   Location: Unless otherwise provided, signs shall be located on a
lot according to the chart set out in Section
5.02  and the following regulations:

from the curb line or improved margin of any street. No ground sign shall be
permitted on or over any public sidewalk, street or other public property.
            2.   Size limitation. The square footage of ground signs that shall
be permitted shall be as follows:
 
Distance of Ground Sign From Curb Line Maximum Square Footage of Sign Allowed
or Improved Margin of Street (feet)
25 - 40                                24
41 - 50                                30
over 50                                36
 
                  For purposes of this section, the square footage of any sign
shall be computed by the length of the sign at its longest point multiplied by
the width of the sign at its widest point.
                  Signs with open spaces within such sign shall be computed as
if the open space was a part of the sign and the square the open space shall be
included as part of the total square footage herein permitted. No ground sign
shall be erected, where the bottom of which exceeds three feet in elevation
above ground or grade level.
            3.   Number of signs permitted. No property shall have more than
one ground sign on the premises.
            4.   Lighting. Lighting shall be permitted on ground signs,
provided that illumination is concentrated upon the area of the sign so as to
prevent glare upon the street or its use and property.
      (4)   Height of signs: The height of the lowest member of a projecting
sign shall not be less than eight feet above the finished grade. Unless
otherwise provided in this Code, the maximum height shall not exceed the
heights given on the chart at Section
5.02 .
      (5)   Illumination: The illumination of signs shall comply with the
development and performance regulations of this Code. Signs which might be
identified as traffic signals or other safety devices shall not be permitted.
In no case shall blinking, flashing, neon or neon-type, moving or other such
signs be permitted. (Ord. 2001-19.)
      (6)   Streamers: Streamers shall not be permitted.
   (b)   Limited Office Districts (B-4): The following signs shall be permitted
in Limited Office Districts (B-4):
      (1)   One wall sign not greater than nine square feet in total area shall
be permitted for all uses on the lot; and such signs shall be subject to the

70 and over              75
 
      (2)   In no event shall any single sign exceed thirty-six square feet,
unless approved by Planning Commission upon a showing by the applicant such
limitation unreasonably restricts the applicant's ability to communicate the
desired information, and that the proposed sign does not constitute a safety
hazard.
      (3)   Moving signs shall not be permitted.
      (4)   Sign areas shall be permitted in addition to the areas specified
above as follows:
         A.   Nameplates: Professional offices or service organizations above
the ground floor of a structure may have additional signs provided the total
area of the signs does not exceed two percent of the floor area occupied by the
establishment or fifteen square feet, whichever is the smaller. Window signs

where such signs are permitted in order to announce a sale, new product, or
other special business event or other special business event or promotion, but
no more than three times per calendar year, with a minimum of thirty days of
separation between each temporary sign. Such temporary sign shall be in
addition to the business’ permanent business signs, provided such temporary
sign does not exceed fourteen square feet in area; two sides are permitted. The
purpose of this provision is to discourage the practice of temporary signage
being used on a quasi-permanent basis and to limit the privilege of a temporary
sign to its intended relatively brief period of time.
   (c)   Location: Unless otherwise provided, signs shall be located on a lot
according to the chart set out at Section
6.02  and the following regulations:
      (1)   General locations: Signs shall not project over or obstruct

shall be permitted. Such signs shall be attached to the wall and shall project
at an angle of ninety degrees therefrom. No sign shall project over a public
right-of-way, nor shall it extend above the height of the structure to which it
is attached or fifteen feet, whichever is less. No face of a projecting sign
shall be less than twenty-five feet from a side lot line or party wall of
establishment.
      (4)   Pole signs: Pole signs shall not be permitted.
      (5)   Ground signs:
         A.   Location. No ground sign shall be nearer than twenty-five feet
from the curb line or improved margin of any street. No ground sign shall be
permitted on or over any public sidewalk, street or other public property.
         B.   Size limitation.
            1.   The square footage of ground signs that shall be permitted
shall be as follows:
 
Distance of Ground Sign From Curb Line or Improved Margin of Maximum Square
Street (feet)                                                Footage of

            2.   For purposes of this section, the square footage of any sign
shall be computed by the length of the sign at its longest point multiplied by
the width of the sign at its widest point.
            3.   Signs with open spaces within such sign shall be computed as
if the open space was a part of the sign and the square footage of the open
space shall be included as part of the total square footage herein permitted.
No ground sign shall be erected, where the bottom of which exceeds three feet
in elevation above ground or grade level.
         C.   Number of signs permitted. No property shall have more than one
ground sign on the premises.
         D.   Lighting. Lighting shall be permitted on ground signs, provided
that illumination is concentrated upon the area of the sign so as to prevent
glare upon the street or its use and property.
   (d)   Height of Signs: The height of the lowest number of a projecting or
pole sign which is not integral with a wall surface, shall not be less than
eight feet above the finished grade. Unless otherwise provided in this Code,

drilling or production of an oil or gas well within 300 feet of any public
right-of-way, nor within 500 feet of any lot line. Such equipment may be within
500 feet of a side yard line which is the common side yard line of two
contiguous parcels which form a drilling unit.
      (11)   For each gas and oil well to be drilled, a conditional use permit
shall be obtained and the applicant shall comply with each and every regulation
of the Zoning Code prior to issuance of the permit, regardless of the number of
permits previously issued within a drilling unit. If the Planning Commission
finds that any applicant for a permit for a gas and oil well is in violation of
any provision of this Zoning Code or any condition imposed upon any previously
issued conditional use permit for a gas and oil well, the Planning Commission
shall be prohibited from issuing any new permits for a gas and oil well until
the applicant provides satisfactory evidence to the Planning Commission that
all violations have been remedied and that all fines, deposits and/or costs

discharge districts) within the Village of South Russell. The groundwater
recharge area map for the Village of South Russell dated January, 1984, and as
may be amended from time to time, shall be maintained at the Office of the
Village Clerk. Any well to be located within an area designated on said map in
the recharge district shall be located at a minimum distance of 2,000 feet from
any water well or any existing structures either within or without the limits
of the Village of South Russell and 2,000 feet from any platted undeveloped
land or land undergoing the process of subdivision or other residential
development or other development where structures or uses will depend on
groundwater for its potable water supply either within or without the limits of
the Village of South Russell at the time an application is made for a
conditional use permit for a gas and oil well. Any applicant seeking to obtain
a conditional use permit for a gas and oil well within a discharge district may
develop in accordance with gas and oil well discharge district regulations set
forth in the chart at Section
7.02. Any gas and oil well located in the recharge district shall develop in
accordance with the regulations set forth in the chart at Section
7.02 for gas and oil wells in recharge districts.
      (13)   Any applicant for a gas and oil well permit whose proposed well
shall be within 2,000 feet of any lake, whether natural or man-made, stream,
creek, or other body of surface water within the Village of South Russell,
shall indicate the same on their application for a conditional use permit. It
shall be the duty of the Planning Commission to impose and the responsibility
of the applicant to comply with additional conditions in order to assure that
any said body of water shall not be exposed to any danger of erosion,
siltation, pollution, contamination, or alteration. In addition, the Village of
South Russell hereby deems Silver Creek, within the limits of the Village of
South Russell, to be in an environmentally protected zone as the habitat of
aquatic life listed on recognized endangered species lists. Any oil and gas
well proposed to be drilled within 2,000 feet of Silver Creek shall present
with their application for a conditional use permit measures to be taken to
avoid any danger of injury to such species or their habitat and the Planning
Commission and Village Engineer are hereby delegated the duty to establish and
enforce conditions to insure that during drilling, production, and abandonment
of any such gas and oil well, that no such injury occurs. The Commission shall
determine, as one condition of the permit, the distance of any well, storage
tanks, production equipment or other apparatus from Silver Creek. Adequate
contingency plans shall be taken to avoid contamination of Silver Creek in the
event that any of oil, gas, brine, waste, toxic materials or other such
contamination spills during drilling, production or abandonment of any oil and
gas well.
      (14)   An applicant for a gas and oil well permit shall file an
application on Form Z-3-A and submit all information set forth in Section
7.02 in order to be deemed to have submitted a complete application for a
conditional use permit. Upon receipt of said application, the application shall
be deemed to have been filed on the first Planning Commission Meeting after

deposit.
         B.   Applicant shall post a ten thousand dollar ($10,000) cash deposit
or surety bond to guarantee proper maintenance and/or restoration of the
drilling site after completion of drilling and proper abandonment of the well.
If during review of an application for a conditional use permit, the Planning
Commission determines that a higher cash deposit is necessary to guarantee
property maintenance and/or restoration of the drilling site and proper
abandonment of the same, the Planning Commission may order a higher cash
deposit as a condition to the issuance of a conditional use permit. Further
said cash deposit or bond will be used to properly landscape the premises in
the event the applicant fails to do so and if the balance falls below ten
thousand dollars ($10,000), the applicant shall submit a new bond or cash to
insure adequate abandonment. Upon completion of abandonment procedures in
compliance with state laws and to the satisfaction of the Commission and upon
total restoration of the property in a condition satisfactory to the
Commission, the applicant may make a request to the Commission to return any
unused portion of the cash deposit or surety bond. Said cash deposit or surety
bond shall be posted with the Village after approval of a permit by the

thousand dollars ($5,000). If at any time should this deposit be reduced by
disbursements to the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000), the applicant shall
be notified to post an additional two thousand dollars ($2,000) to bring the
total cash deposit back up to three thousand dollars ($3,000). Upon
satisfactory completion of drilling of said well, and upon commencement of
production, the applicant may request a return of the unused portion of the
cash deposit. In the event that the applicant has complied with all Village
laws and regulations, the Village shall return all but two thousand dollars
($2,000) of said deposit to the applicant. The remaining two thousand dollars
($2,000) of said deposit may be used by the Village of South Russell for
hearings, inspections, testing of water wells, springs and surface waters by
the hydrologist, or such other inspections deemed to be necessary by the
Village of South Russell of said well site during the production and/or
abandonment stages. If at any time should this deposit be reduced by
disbursements to the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000), the applicant shall
be notified to post an additional one thousand dollars ($1,000) to bring the
total cash deposit back up to two thousand dollars ($2,000). Upon completion of
abandonment procedures in compliance with all laws and regulations, said two
thousand dollars ($2,000) deposit or any unused portion remaining shall be
returned to the applicant upon request. If the applicant, after drilling of a
well, determines not to make a well a productive well, the five thousand dollar
($5,000) cash deposit shall be held by the Village to insure that the applicant
complies with all applicable laws and regulations regarding abandonment of said
well and said deposit shall be returned upon the request of the applicant upon

same is brought against the Village of South Russell as a result of any
activity engaged in by the applicant or their contractors in furtherance of the
drilling and production or abandonment of any oil and gas well within the
Village of South Russell. In the event that the surety ceases to do business,
or if for any other reason said surety bond becomes void, the applicant shall
immediately substitute a similar surety bond in the same amount, and in a form
to be approved by the Solicitor, and in the event that the applicant fails to
submit a substitute bond within seven days after receiving notice that the
surety bond has become void, it shall be a violation of the Zoning Code and in
addition to all other penalties, the Commission, after notice and public
hearing within thirty days after notifying the applicant, may order the
applicant to cease drilling or production, and comply with state abandonment
procedures to abandon the well. In the event that the Planning Commission
orders such to occur and the applicant fails to comply, the Village may use any
and all cash deposits or bonds and enter onto the applicant's premises to cause
the same to occur. By requesting a conditional use permit to drill a gas and
oil well in the Village of South Russell, any applicant is deemed to have
consented to the Village taking the necessary steps to obtain abandonment of
any gas and oil well being operated, at any stage, in violation of the Zoning
Code or any other applicable federal, state or Village law or regulation.
            19.   The Commission shall establish a surety bond, in an amount to
be determined by the Commission, and in a form to be approved by the Solicitor,
necessary to guarantee the repair or replacement of possible damage to private

No conditional use permit shall be issued until such time as a surety bond
naming the applicants as insureds and the Village of South Russell as
additional insureds is posted. Such surety bond shall be in effect during the
life of the well and until abandonment of the well has been approved by the
state and the Village and all other deposits have been returned to the
applicant and all laws and regulations have been complied with by the
applicant. The amount of the bond shall be established after the public hearing
otherwise required by the Zoning Code and upon recommendation from the Village
Engineer and Solicitor. Said bond shall specifically provide that it shall
protect private property without limitation as to ownership or location of the
same and further said bond shall provide coverage, in the amount determined by
the Commission, for any damage or injury to real or personal private property
or to personal or bodily injury regardless of fault on the part of the
applicant. In the event that the surety ceases to do business, or if for any
other reason said surety bond becomes void, the applicant shall immediately
substitute a similar surety bond in the same amount, and in a form to be
approved by the Solicitor and in the event that the applicant fails to submit a
substitute bond within seven days after receiving notice that the surety bond
has become void, it shall be a violation of the Zoning Code and in addition to
all other penalties, the Commission, after notice and public hearing within
thirty days after notifying the applicant, may order the applicant to cease
drilling or production, and comply with state abandonment procedures to abandon
the well. In the event that the Planning Commission orders such to occur and
the applicant fails to comply, the Village may use any and all cash deposits or
bonds and enter onto the applicant's premises to cause the same to occur.

located in a groundwater sensitive zone, the Commission shall require proof of
adequate potable water for any private cluster residential development, multi-
family, elderly assisted living, industrial, business or conditional use to
service employees, tenants, owners, expected customers, and any use engaged in
at the premises which employs water. (Amended by Ord. 1992-9, passed 02-24-92.)
10.02 REGULATION.
   Any business or industrial development proposed for more than one structure
on site shall be entitled, upon approval of the Commission, to develop such
uses considering off-site premises under the following conditions as follows:
   (a)   Maximum lot coverage may include contiguous land not owned by the
developer acceptable to the Commission so long as said property is subject to
such easements and restrictions as are satisfactory to the Commission and which
easements and restrictions permit developer to utilize such additional land for
parking, loading, common area, circulation, screening, and other features such
as grading and site development, where such rights granted to the developer by
the off-site property owners are of such length and grant such rights as are
necessary to satisfy the Commission that they may be treated as part of the
development for the purposes as set forth herein. Contiguous, for the purposes
of this section shall mean a tract of land contiguous for a minimum of thirty
linear feet, located on the same side of the street and located in the same
zoning district.

CHAPTER 12
Nonconforming Use Regulations
12.00   Intent.
12.01   Nonconforming uses.
12.02   Nonconforming structures.
12.03   Nonconforming lots.
12.00 INTENT.
   Within districts herein established, uses, structures and lots which were
lawful prior to the passage of this Code, (or lawful prior to the passage of an
amendment or addition to those), but which would be prohibited by this Code,
are considered to be nonconforming uses. It is the intent of this Code to
permit such uses to continue until they are removed or abandoned, although they
are considered to be incompatible with the permitted uses in the districts
established by the Code. It is further the intent that nonconforming uses shall
not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended; that nonconforming uses be changed
only to a more restrictive use; and that the rebuilding of nonconforming
structures damaged in excess of fifty percent of their reproduction value shall
conform with this Code.
12.01 NONCONFORMING USES.
   A use existing lawfully on the effective date of this Code which does not
conform to this Code is a nonconforming use and may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Change of Use: A nonconforming use may only be changed to a conforming
use, or to a use permitted in a more restricted district if approved by the
Commission. Thereafter it shall not be changed back to the former nonconforming
use. For this purpose, the districts shall be considered as listed in order of
restrictiveness, from most to least restrictive, as follows:
      (1)   R-1-D
      (2)   R-1-C
      (3)   R-1-B
      (4)   R-1-A
      (5)   RN-1
      (6)   B-2
      (7)   B-1
      (8)   I-1
   (b)   Expansion of Use: A nonconforming use or part of a structure or lot
may only be expanded or extended throughout those parts which were manifestly
arranged or designed for such use on the effective date of this Code, and no
such use shall be extended so as to occupy any additional land.
   (c)   Discontinuance of Use: If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a
continuous period of one year, any future use shall be in conformity with the
use regulations of the district in which such use is located.
   (d)   Nonconforming Signs: See Section
9.00 (d). (Ord. 2001-19.)
   (e)   Nonconforming Parking Facilities: A nonconforming use which does not
conform to the off-street parking or loading regulations of this Code may be
occupied by the existing use without such parking and loading facilities being
provided. If an existing structure is altered so that there is an increase in
the number of dwelling units, seating capacity or floor area, or if the use is
changed to a use requiring more off-street spaces, no zoning or occupancy
permit shall be issued for such alteration until off-street parking and loading
facilities have been provided which are at least equal to the number of spaces
required by this Code for the entire structure or use.
   (f)   Performance Standards: A use which is nonconforming with respect to
one or more of the performance standards specified in this Code shall not be
required to conform therewith except at such time that the structure or use is
changed or expanded.
12.02 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   A structure existing lawfully on the effective date of this Code which does
not conform to the area, yard or height regulations of the district in which it
is located is a lawful nonconforming structure. Such structures may continue to
be occupied so long as they remain otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
   (a)   Maintenance and Repair: A nonconforming structure may continue to be
used, maintained and repaired, provided no structural parts are replaced except
when required by law to restore the structure to a safe condition, or make it
conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (b)   Additions: A nonconforming structure shall not be altered, added to or
enlarged unless the additions and original structure are made to conform to the
area, width, yard and height requirements of the district in which it is
located however, nonconforming dwellings may be altered, modernized or enlarged
provided they comply with the existing width, yard, and height regulations to
the extent possible. If the enlargement or alteration cannot comply with
present regulations, a zoning permit may be issued if enlargement or alteration
complies with zoning regulations in effect just prior to the zoning amendment
making such dwelling, located in a residential zone, nonconforming and
appropriate proof of inability to comply and the date said dwelling was
constructed is presented to the Zoning Inspector. If said structure was
constructed prior to the enactment of any zoning ordinance within the Village
of South Russell, or prior to the incorporation of the Village of South
Russell, then any alteration, addition, enlargement, or any other change shall
comply with the zoning regulation in effect just prior to the amendment making
such dwelling nonconforming or if such compliance is not possible, such
enlargement or alteration or addition or any other change shall not be allowed
by the Zoning Inspector and the applicant must seek a variance from the Zoning
Board of Appeals. In the event, however, that an alteration, addition,
enlargement or any other change of a structure constructed prior to the
enactment of zoning can comply with present regulations, said applicant shall
conform where possible to present regulations.
   (c)   Moving: A nonconforming structure shall not be moved in whole or in
part to any other location on the lot or other premises, unless every portion
of the structure so moved conforms to the regulations of the district into
which it is moved.
   (d)   Damaged Structure: If a nonconforming structure is damaged or
destroyed to the extent of fifty percent or less of its reproduction value,
those portions so destroyed or damaged may be restored but to not more than its
former size, provided such restoration is completed within a period of one year
after the date of damage or destruction. If such structure is occupied by a
nonconforming use prior to damage, such use may be continued. If a
nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed more than fifty percent of its
reproduction value, no repairing or reconstruction shall be made unless every
portion of the structure conforms to the regulations of the district in which
it is located, and unless the structure is thereafter occupied by a conforming
use. Determination of reproduction value shall be made by three practicing
construction contractors: One appointed by the owner, one by the municipality
and one selected by mutual consent of the two parties.
12.03 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   The use of a vacant lot which does not conform to this Code may continue so
long as its use remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Expansion of Use: The nonconforming use of a lot, or part thereof,
shall not be expanded or extended onto other parts of the lot.
   (b)   Discontinuance of Use: If the nonconforming use of a lot, or part
thereof, is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, any future use of
such lot, or part thereof, shall conform to the use regulations of the district
in which it is located.
   (c)   Insufficient Size: A lot of record, located in a residential district,
nonconforming due to the enactment of a zoning ordinance or amendment to a
zoning ordinance, shall be permitted to develop in accordance with the zoning
regulations in effect just prior to the amendment which changes said lot into a
nonconforming lot, to the extent that the size or shape of said lot prevents
development of the lot in accordance with the lot area, width, density, front
yard, side yard, rear yard, or maximum height regulations in effect at the time
development is proposed. To the extent said lot can be developed in accordance
with existing zoning regulations, the present regulations shall prevail over
prior enactments. The Zoning Inspector is hereby authorized to issue a zoning
permit and the Planning Commission is hereby authorized to grant developmental
approval upon appropriate proof of the inability of a lot to comply with
present regulations and the date said lot was recorded. Any lot of record
existing prior to the enactment of any zoning ordinance within the Village of
South Russell or prior to the amendment which changes said lot into a
nonconforming lot, and where such compliance with this section is not possible,
such development of the lot shall not be allowed by the Zoning Inspector and
the applicant must seek a variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals. In the
event, however, said lot can be developed to comply with present regulations,
said applicant shall conform where possible to present regulations.

1406.02 PURPOSES.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code, as adopted in Section
1406.01, is to:
   (a)   Provide uniform standards and requirements for the erection,

technical methods, devices and improvements, including the use of
industrialized units, which tend to reduce the cost of construction and
erection without affecting minimum requirements for health, safety and security
of the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units and without
preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods
of construction; and
   (d)   Encourage, so far as is practical, the standardization of construction
practices, methods, equipment, material and techniques, including methods
employed to produce industrialized units.

satisfactory payment to the Village of any such arrearage by applicant.
   (d)   The Building Inspector shall not issue a building permit to any
individual, firm, corporation, partnership or other entity which has previously

project which requires such statement, unless such form has been filed by the
time of the request for the building permit.
   (e)   In the event the Building Inspector denies an applicant a building
permit based upon paragraphs (a), (c) or (d) of this section, the applicant
shall have the right to appeal such denial by filing a written notice of appeal

shall prevail in the issuance of all types of building permits. All building
plans, except plans for minor alterations or those plans judged to be exempt by
the Building Inspector, shall be stamped by a licensed architect. The Building
Inspector may, in his professional judgment, exempt those plans where, owing to
a lack of complexity or degree of difficulty, or similar rationale, the
Building Inspector determines that an architect’s stamp is unnecessary. The
Building Inspector, before issuing any permit, is authorized to charge and
collect the fees and deposits specified in this chapter. The fees prescribed
herein shall be additive and, unless otherwise specifically provided, separate
fees shall be paid for each of the items listed.
(Ord. 2003-19. Passed 7-14-03.)

the sum of the gross horizontal areas of the several floors, including
basements, cellars and attics that are at least fifty percent habitable. All
horizontal dimensions shall be taken from the exterior faces of walls,
including enclosed porches and stoops.
   (b)   Establishing Costs. Where a permit fee is based upon the cost of the
work done under the permit, such costs shall be the actual cost as certified by
the owner or the authorized representative of the owner and as approved by the
Building Inspector. The Building Inspector, may, at any time up to three months
after the completion of the building, require the submission of authoritative
estimates or actual cost data to substantiate the estimated cost stated in the
application for a permit, and require the payment of additional fees when it is
demonstrated that the actual cost of the work is in excess of the estimated
cost upon which permit fees were based.
   (c)   Time Limitations. Any permit issued shall become invalid if the work
authorized by it has not been commenced within six months after its issuance or
if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of
one year after the time the work is commenced. All permits so issued shall
expire twelve calendar months from the date of issuance. For cause, one
extension not exceeding forty-five days may be allowed, in writing, by the
Building Inspector.
The approval of plans or drawings and specifications for any building subject
to the Ohio Building Code is invalid if construction, erection, alteration, or
other work upon the building has not commenced within twelve months of the
approval of the plans or drawings and specifications. One extension shall be
granted for an additional twelve month period if requested by the applicant at
least ten days in advance of the expiration of the permit and upon payment of a
fee in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00). If in the course of
construction, work is delayed or suspended for more than six months, the
approval of plans or drawings and specifications or data is invalid. Two
extensions shall be granted for six months each if requested by the applicant
at least ten days in advance of the expiration of the permit and upon payment
of a fee for each extension of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Before any work
may continue on the construction, erection, alteration or equipment of any
building for which the approval is invalid, the applicant shall resubmit the
plans and drawings and specifications for approval pursuant to this section.

been issued has been abandoned and is not to be done, such permit may be
returned to the Building Inspector for cancellation and, if no construction has
started, after a deduction of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for administrative
expenses, one-half of the balance of the permit fee, if any, shall be refunded.
If actual construction has commenced, no refund of any permit fee shall be
allowed.
      (Ord. 1985-69. Passed 12-9-85.)
   (e)   Refund of Cash Deposits. Cash deposits shall be refunded only after
the Building Inspector and the Street Commissioner have deducted all charges
for all damages or inspections and after a determination is made that no
further damages or inspections will be necessary or are reasonably foreseeable.
         Upon receipt and approval of as-built grade plans by the Village
Engineer and upon the receipt by the Fiscal Officer or Fiscal Auditor, if one
is appointed, of forms established by the Tax Administrator showing proof of
filing of wage statement and withholding of income tax for income earned within
the Village by all contractors, the Fiscal Officer or Fiscal Auditor, if one is
appointed, shall authorize release of any remaining deposit.

control of a building under construction is prohibited from allowing such
building to be occupied until it has been finally inspected and approved by the
Building Inspector and a certificate of occupancy has been applied for, in
writing, and has been issued by the Building Inspector.
   (g)   Deposits. All deposits shall be cash and subject to an increase if the
nature of the work warrants or if damage during construction exceeds the

depend upon the nature of the work and shall be estimated by the Village
Engineer.

permit is sought or who is the general contractor for which a permit is sought
shall be exempt from the requirements of making any cash deposit hereunder. A
personal bond only shall be required of such owner-occupant. Such bond shall be
on a form prescribed by the Solicitor and shall contain therein an
authorization to charge such owner-occupant for any sum necessary to replace
and/or restore any damage caused to Village property during construction, or
for the proper grading or draining of the premises, if not completed as

immediately reimburse the deposit fund to bring it up to its full original
amount. If the owner or agent fails to make such reimbursement, the Building
Inspector may issue an order stopping all work on the project until
reimbursement is made. After construction work has been completed and any
necessary repairs or cleaning are completed to the satisfaction of the Building
Inspector, the deposit shall be refunded.

   (f)   Whether or not the deposit was made prior to the effective date of
this subsection, when more than twelve months have passed since the making of
any initial deposit required under this Chapter
1440, and further, where no significant activity is occurring with regard to
the construction activities associated with such deposit, then the Building
Inspector shall cause a notice to be sent to the depositor and owner setting
forth any Village requirements then outstanding, and allowing said depositor
and/or owner 30 days to remedy such deficiencies. After the expiration of such
30 days, if the deficiencies have not been remedied, the Building Inspector
shall cause a notice of forfeiture to be sent by certified mail and regular
mail to the depositor and/or owner, which forfeiture may be appealed by the
depositor and/or owner by submitting an appeal in writing and emailing, hand-
delivering, or mailing such appeal to the Village: (i) within ten business days
not including weekend days or holidays from the date that the certified mail
return receipt of the notice of forfeiture was signed, or if such signature
date is not evident from the certified mail return receipt, then the date the
certified mail return receipt of the notice of forfeiture was received by the
Village; or (ii) in the event that no certified return receipt of the notice of
forfeiture is received by the Village and the notice of forfeiture sent by
regular mail was not returned to the Village for failure to forward or other
reason, within 20 business days not including weekend days or holidays from the
date that the Village mailed the notice of forfeiture by regular mail. If no
such appeal is timely received by the Village, said deposit shall be forfeited
to the Village. At Council's discretion, all or a portion of such deposit may
be refunded to said depositor and/or owner. In such event, Council may also
determine to retain a portion of such deposit in order to defray any reasonable
cost to the Village associated with the forfeiture procedure, including, but
not limited to, office overhead, postage, labor, and legal expenses.

implemented until the site reaches final stabilization. All properties adjacent
to the site of soil-disturbing activity shall be protected from soil erosion
and sediment run-off and damage, including, but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public
lands.
   It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of contractor
(s) responsible for implementation the SWP3 and providing that information to
the Village Engineer. The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact stormwater runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3.
   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and maintained
effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the course of earth
disturbing activities. The controls shall include the following minimum
components:
   (a)   NON-STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION MEASURES: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree preservation areas
or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil compaction shall be
minimized and, unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and
maintain a 50-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the state, or riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever
is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible (e.g., stream
crossings for roads or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation
and restoration). Direct stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment
removal and maximize stormwater infiltration.
   (b)   EROSION CONTROL PRACTICES: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. The amount of soil
exposed during construction activity shall be minimized. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
    Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
Table 1: Permanent Stabilization

                                       operational responsibility.
Disturbed areas that will be idle over Prior to November 1 or the onset of
winter.                                winter weather, whichever occurs first.
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed.
 
 
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels.  Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
    (c)   RUNOFF CONTROL PRACTICES. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent
erosion. Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to
minimize erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge locations and along
the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive flow velocity from the
structure to a water course so that the natural physical and biological
characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
   (d)   SEDIMENT CONTROL PRACTICES. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas to minimize sediment discharges from
the site. Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days. Such practices
may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain
inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to
a sediment settling pond. The design, installation and maintenance of erosion
and sediment controls shall address factors such as the amount, frequency,
intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater
runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of soil particle sizes
expected to be present on the site.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are
not considered a sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a
sediment settling pond.
      Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the Village Engineer and/or the
Geauga SWCD, is required for any one of the following conditions:
         A.   Concentrated stormwater runoff.
         B.   Runoff from drainage areas which exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence (see Table 3) inlet protection, or other sediment barriers;
         C.   Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of
disturbed land.
Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the form of a sediment trap or
sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Rainwater and Land
Development. The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a sediment
trap shall be limited to less than 5 acres. Contributing drainage areas of 5
acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin. An equivalent best
management practice may be utilized upon approval from the Village.
The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone and a
dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 1,800
cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. The
dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a minimum 48-
hour drain time, and, unless infeasible, be designed to always withdraw runoff
from the surface of the pond throughout the storm cycle. As such, a skimmer
discharge device consistent with Rainwater and Land Development shall be
provided to dewater sediment basins. Sediment traps shall also provide both a
sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet structure shall be
constructed consistent with the specifications contained in the latest edition
of Rainwater and Land Development.
When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be used as
temporary sediment trapping BMPs, a skimmer discharge device consistent with
Rainwater and Land Development shall be utilized during construction phase and
until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the Village.
The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of sediment
basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the pond
provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering zone. As
such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be no
discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage zone
and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only occur
through the skimmer.
The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods:
Method 1:   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1000ft3 per
disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
Method 2:   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume
necessary to store the sediment as calculated with RUSLE or other generally
accepted erosion prediction model.
When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas
which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the dewatering zone
must be less than or equal to five (5) feet. The configuration between the
inlets and the outlet of the sediment-settling pond must provide at least two
units of length for each one unit of width ? 2:1 length-to-width ratio;
however, a length to width ratio of ? 4:1 is recommended. Sediment must be
removed from the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity of the
sediment storage zone has been completely filled by sediment accumulations.
This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin
depth. When designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider
public safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the
sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment
and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is
encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties
and water resources from sediment transported via sheet flow. Where intended to
provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on a level contour and
shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The relationship between the
maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is shown in
Table 3 below. Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend the size
of the permissible drainage area.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence Based on Slope
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                > 20% but < 50%
 
      (4)    Alternative perimeter controls for sheet flow discharges may be
considered by the Village, but their use shall not exceed the limitations
indicated in Table 3 above. Detail drawings and plan notes shall specify the
diameter of filter socks, compost berms and other such alternative perimeter
controls if used instead of silt fence.
      (5)   Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to 10 acres.
      (6)    Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond. Straw or hay
bales and filter socks around catch basins are not acceptable forms of inlet
protection.
      (7)    Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete or
cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and
constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development.
          B.   Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances
shall be kept free of sediment tracked off site. Streets directly adjacent to
construction entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall
be cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
Based on site conditions, Village Engineer and/or the Geauga SWCD may require
additional best management practices to control off site tracking and dust.
These additional BMPs may include:
         C.   Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
         D.   Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these
areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling
pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
1466.07 (g) of this regulation. No surfactants or detergents may be used to
wash vehicles.
         E.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The [community] Engineer and/or the
[county] SWCD may require dust controls including the use of water trucks to
wet disturbed areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed
areas, and regulation of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (8)    Surface Waters of the State protection. Construction vehicles
shall avoid water resources. A 50 foot undisturbed natural buffer shall be
provided around surface waters of the state unless infeasible. If it is
infeasible to provide and maintain an undisturbed 50-foot natural buffer, the
SWP3 shall comply with the stabilization requirements in
1466.07(b)(1) for areas within 50 feet of a surface water or riparian or
wetland setbacks if applicable, whichever is greater; and minimize soil
compaction and, unless infeasible, preserve topsoil. If a riparian or wetland
setback is greater than 50 feet, no disturbance of natural vegetation shall
occur within the riparian or wetland setback unless a variance to the riparian
or wetland setback regulation has been granted. If the applicant is permitted
to disturb areas within 50 feet of a water resource, the following conditions
shall be addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in water resources
or wetlands.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
          E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
         G.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands. The flow should
be released such that no erosion occurs downslope. Level spreaders may need to
be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
      (9)    Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (f)   NON-SEDIMENT POLLUTANT CONTROLS: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in stormwater runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources, wetlands or
the MS4. These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      A.   Waste Materials: A covered dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      B.   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, other public facility, natural resource or water of the
state is prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available.
      C.   Disposal of Other Wastewaters: The discharge of washout and cleanout
of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other construction
materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural resource or
waters of the state is prohibited. The discharge of soaps or solvents used in
vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited. If generated, these
wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
      D.   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest
containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall be provided to clean up
spills. The SWP3 shall contain spill prevention and response procedures and
these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-construction meeting.
      E.   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly. The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
      F.   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
Where construction activities are to occur on sites with contamination from
previous activities, operators shall be aware that concentrations of materials
that meet other criteria (i.e. not considered a Hazardous Waste, meeting
Voluntary Action Program (VAP standards)) may still result in stormwater
discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality Standards. Such discharges are not
authorized by this code. Control measures which may be utilized to meet this
requirement include, but are not limited to:
         i.   Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated runoff
and prevent discharge.
         ii.   Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer with
the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
         iii.   Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or other
such methods to prevent storm water from coming into contact with contaminated
materials.
The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure of building materials,
building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Applicants may
also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, Safety Response Plans,
etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such
plan is maintained on site.
   (g)    COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (h)    TRENCH AND GROUND WATER CONTROL. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (i)    INTERNAL INSPECTIONS.  All controls on the site shall be inspected a
at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm
event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection
frequency may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is
temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g.,
site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of
inspection requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions
are expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been
attained from the Village Engineer and/or the Geauga SWCD and all of the
following conditions are met:
      A.   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
      B.   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
      C.   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to evaluate
whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are
required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls.
These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the Village or an alternate form
acceptable to the Village Engineer. The inspection form shall include:
         A.   The inspection date.
         B.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
         C.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
         D.   Weather information and a description of any discharges occurring
at the time of inspection.
         E.   Locations of:
            1.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
            2.   BMPs that need to be maintained.
            3.   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate
for a particular location.
            4.   Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
         F.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to the
SWP3 and implementation dates.
      (3)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
      (4)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (5)   The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non-compliance determined by these inspections.
     (j)   MAINTENANCE. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. All
sediment control practices must be maintained in a functional condition until
all up slope areas they control reach final stabilization. The applicant shall
provide a description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the continued
performance of control practices and shall ensure a responsible party and
adequate funding to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the Village
Engineer.
When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When BMPs require repair or maintenance. If an internal inspection
reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of a
sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within three (3) days
of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function.  If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function as
detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be
installed within ten (10) days.
      (3)   When BMPs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in accordance with the
schedule, the control practice must be implemented within ten (10) days from
the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection reveals that the planned
control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
   (k)   FINAL STABLIZATION. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
Village Engineer. Once a definable area has achieved final stabilization, the
applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further inspection requirement
applies to that portion of the site.
      (Ord. 2016-40. Passed 12-12-16.)
1466.08 ABBREVIATED STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN (SWP3).
   (a)   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the
applicant shall submit an Abbreviated SWP3 in accordance with the requirements
of this regulation.
   (b)   The Abbreviated SWP3 shall be certified by a professional engineer, a
registered surveyor, certified professional erosion and sediment control
specialist, or a registered landscape architect.
   (c)   The Abbreviated SWP3 shall include a minimum of the following BMPs.
The Village may require other BMPs as site conditions warrant.
      (1)   Construction Entrances: Construction entrances shall be built and
shall serve as the only permitted points of ingress and egress to the
development area. These entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of
aggregate stone or recycled concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in
diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and constructed in conformance with
specifications in the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
       (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be indicated on the
plan. Use for other waste and wastewater is prohibited.
      (3)   Street Sweeping: Streets directly adjacent to construction
entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned
daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on
these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall be cleaned weekly.
      (4)   Stabilization. The development area shall be stabilized as detailed
in Table 4.
Table 4: Stabilization
 
Area requiring stabilization           Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any disturbed area within 50 feet of a Within 2 days of the most recent
surface water of the state and not at  disturbance if that area will remain
final grade.                           idle for more than 14 days
For all construction activities, any
disturbed area, including soil
stockpiles, that will be dormant for   Within 7 days of the most recent
more than 14 days but less than one    disturbance within the area
year, and not within 50 feet of a
stream.
Disturbed areas that will be idle over Prior to November 1
winter
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization
techniques must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion
matting.
 
 
      (5)   Inlet Protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems, including rear yard inlets. Straw, hay
bales, and filter socks are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (6)   Silt Fence and Other Perimeter Controls. Silt fence and other
perimeter controls approved by the Village shall be used to protect adjacent
properties and water resources from sediment discharged via sheet (diffused)
flow. Silt fence shall be placed along level contours and the permissible
drainage area is limited to those indicated in Table 3 in
1466.07 of these regulations.
      (7)   Internal Inspection and Maintenance. All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24
hour period. Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance. If the internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         B.   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function. If the
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be installed
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         C.   When BMPs depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not installed. If
the internal inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within

structures or devices. (Ord. 2016-40. Passed 12-12-16.)
 1466.12 DEPOSIT; PLOT PLAN.
   (a)    Each person, firm or corporation required to file a Plot Plan under
Section
 1466.08 shall also deposit cash in the amount of five hundred dollars
($500.00). Such deposit shall be returned to the applicant only upon such
satisfactory proof to the Building Commissioner of compliance with this Chapter
1466, the improvements were properly installed, submission of a Final Plot Plan
as required under Section
1466.11, installation of permanent vegetation, approval of the Final Plot Plan
by the Village Engineer and deduction of all costs of the Village in approving
the Final Plot Plan and assuring compliance with this Chapter
1466. No Building Permit shall be issued until the deposit required by this
section is submitted to the Building Commissioner and the Plot Plan required
under Section
1466.09 has been approved by the Village Engineer.
   
   (b)    If, after the installation of improvements, the applicant fails to
submit a Final Plot Plan within sixty days, or the Building Commissioner
determines there has not been satisfactory proof of compliance with this
Chapter
1466, or timely compliance as set forth within any SWP3 or Plot Plan approval,
then the Building Commissioner shall cause a notice to be sent to the depositor
and/or owner setting forth any such requirements then outstanding, and allowing
said depositor and/or owner thirty days to remedy such deficiencies.
   
   (c)    After the expiration of such thirty days, if the deficiencies have
not been remedied, the Building Commissioner shall cause a notice of forfeiture
to be sent by certified mail to the depositor and/or owner and allowing for ten
days from the date of said notice in which the depositor and/or owner may
appeal such proposed forfeiture in writing to Planning Commission by certified
mail. If no such appeal is timely received, said deposit shall be forfeited to
the Village. At Planning Commission's discretion, all or a portion of such
deposit may be refunded to said depositor and/or owner. Planning Commission may
also determine to retain a portion of such deposit in order to defray any
reasonable cost to the Village associated with the forfeiture procedure,
including, but not limited to, office overhead, postage, labor, and legal
expenses. (Ord. 2016-40. Passed 12-12-16.)
1466.13 TEMPORARY OCCUPANCY PERMITS; CONDITIONS OF OBTAINING DEPOSIT.
   (a)    The Building Commissioner may grant a Temporary Building Occupancy
Permit where the ultimate occupant of a structure, or the person responsible to
install permanent vegetation, is unable to install the same at the time such
person intends to occupy or use the structure. Where such permanent vegetation
cannot be installed because of adverse weather conditions, such temporary
permit may not be issued until the applicant has deposited with the Village an
amount no less than one thousand dollars ($1,000), nor more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000), as determined by the Building Commissioner depending upon the
lot size and/or grading involved. The purpose of said deposit shall be to
insure that permanent vegetation will be properly installed within the time
limit established by the Building Commissioner in the temporary permit and,
further, that such vegetation shall have appropriately matured so that the
Building Commissioner is reasonably satisfied that such vegetation will not
have to be substantially replaced.
   
   (b)    In the event the recipient of such temporary Building Occupancy
Permit has not timely installed or properly installed such permanent
vegetation, such additional deposit shall be forfeited to the Village upon
application of the Building Commissioner to the Planning Commission and upon
approval of the Planning Commission at a public meeting, for which the owner of
deposited funds shall have been given notice and an opportunity to show cause
why such deposit should not be forfeited.
   
   (c)    In addition to such forfeiture, where the circumstances described in
the preceding paragraph exist, the Building Commissioner may also seek
forfeiture of the Plot Plan deposit required under Section
1466.12. The procedure for seeking such additional forfeiture shall be the same
as described in the preceding paragraph.
   
   (d)    A condition of the grant of such a temporary Building Occupancy
Permit under this section shall be the obligation of the applicant (and owner,
if different from applicant) to sign a written consent form allowing the
Village to use the deposits referred to in this section to reimburse the
Village for installation of permanent vegetation in the event the same is not
timely completed. Furthermore, such form shall provide for irrevocable consent
to the Village or its agents, employees, contractors, or subcontractors to
enter upon the owner's property to install permanent vegetation in conformity
with the approval plans for control of erosion and siltation. Upon installation
of the permanent vegetation, the Building Commissioner may issue a final
occupancy permit if the Building Commissioner is assured of compliance with all
provisions of this chapter and any other provisions of the Building Code for
the Village.
(Ord. 2016-40. Passed 12-12-16.)
1466.14 STOP WORK ORDERS.
   (a)    In the event the Building Commissioner or Village Engineer finds that
any improvements are being made to any land subject to this chapter in
violation of the approved SWP3 conditions, or the approved Plot Plan, or any
other regulations set forth in this chapter, the Building Commissioner shall
give written notice to the person, firm, or entity responsible for construction
of such improvements, notifying them of the violation of this chapter or of the
plan approval conditions. The Building Commissioner may issue a Stop Work Order
or an adjudicative order and take such other legal or equitable action to
enjoin any further construction of improvements upon any land where land
disturbance has occurred.
   
   (b)    In the event the status of the improvement activity at the time such
Stop Work or adjudicative order is issued is such as to create a risk of
probable adverse environmental impact or erosion harm, the Village Engineer may
require the applicant, or the owner if different from the applicant, to
immediately undertake sufficient remedial measures to prevent such impact or
harm. Such remedial measures shall be as prescribed by the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 2016-40. Passed 12-12-16.)
1466.15 FOUNDATION OR SLAB ELEVATION CHECK.
   At such time as the builder or other permit holder has constructed the
foundation or slab referred to in Section
 1466.08, he shall request that the Building Commissioner check the grade. The
Building Commissioner may require that the Village Engineer check the grade of
the foundation or slab. No further construction shall be permitted until the
Building Commissioner or Village Engineer has checked the elevation of such
foundation and found it to be in accordance with the Plot Plan approved
pursuant to this chapter.

   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)" means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   "Fill" means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   "Flood" or "Flooding" means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   "Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)" means the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   "Flood Insurance Risk Zones" means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. The following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:    
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.

the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)   "Flood Insurance Study (FIS)" means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   "Flood Protection Elevation (FPE)" means the base flood elevation plus
one (1) foot of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   "Floodway" means a floodway is the channel of a river or other
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to
pass the base flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a
hydraulic and hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase
in the water surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a
designated height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot
at any point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   "Historic structure" means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis" means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   "Letter of Map Change (LOMC)" means a Letter of Map Change is an
official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood
Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance
Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the following categories:
   (v)   “Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)" means a revision based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special
flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map
and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood
hazard area.
   (w)   "Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)" means a revision based on technical
data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
   (x)   "Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)" means a formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (y)   "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (z)   "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (aa)   "Manufactured home park" as specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, means a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which
three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free
of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of
installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home
park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the
roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
   (bb)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)" is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (cc)   “New construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of this
ordinance and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (dd)   "Person" means any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (ee)   "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (ff)   "Registered Professional Architect" means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01
to 4703.19 of the Revised Code.

professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (hh)   "Registered Professional Surveyor" means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ii)   "Special Flood Hazard Area" also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard," means the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (jj)   "Start of construction" means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (kk)   "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ll)   "Substantial Damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (mm)   “Substantial Improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (nn)   "Variance" means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (oo)   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.

Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Village of
South Russell, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation / Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of South Russell have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of South Russell's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the
Village of South Russell boundaries, include within such notification a copy of
a map of the Village of South Russell suitable for reproduction, clearly
showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of South
Russell has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1468.05.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.

"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village of South Russell specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1468.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement,
decision or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the
administration or enforcement of these regulations and shall have the authority
to grant variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (b)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the BZA provided that such person shall file,
within twenty (20) days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the BZA.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the BZA shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (c)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The BZA shall have the power to authorize, in
specific cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not
inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary
hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the BZA.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) plus the costs of
certified U.S. postal mail to each adjacent property owner.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. Prior to the hearing, a notice of such
hearing shall be given in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village one
time at least fifteen (15) days before the date of the hearing and by certified
mail, return receipt requested, on all adjoining property owners at least
fifteen (15) days prior to hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the BZA requires. In considering such variance applications, the
BZA shall consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant
factors, standards specified in other sections of these regulations and the
following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the BZA may attach such conditions to the granting of variances,
as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (c)(3)A.1. to 11.
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (d)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, including all
documents presented and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The BZA shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The BZA shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its decision
and may first request of any parties that they submit proposed findings of fact
and conclusions of law. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the
hearing and thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in
writing within a reasonable time after the hearing.
   (e)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the BZA may
appeal such decision to the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas, as provided in
Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 2009-20. Passed 6-8-09.)
1468.06  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1468.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall
give notice of such violation to the person responsible therefore and order
compliance with these regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice and
order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;
      (2)   Include a list of violations, referring to the section or sections
of these regulations that have been violated, and order remedial action, which,
if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of these regulations;
      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this
notice and order shall be deemed to be properly served upon the owner,
occupant, or agent if a copy thereof is sent by registered or certified mail to
the person's last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/
or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a second degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the Village of South Russell and/or of the state Ohio
law, as applicable. Each day such a violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Village of South
Russell from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation. The Village of South Russell shall prosecute any
violation of these regulations in accordance with the penalties stated herein.

1480.01 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   The exterior of all premises and the condition of all buildings and
structures thereon shall be maintained so that the appearance thereof shall
reflect a level of maintenance in keeping with the standards of the Village as
defined in this chapter and so as to avoid blighting effects and hazards to
health and safety and to promote the general welfare of the Village.
(Ord. 1983-46. Passed 10-24-83.)
1480.02 MAINTENANCE STANDARDS.
   The owner or occupant or both of all property and premises within the
Village shall comply with the following requirements:
   (a)    General Maintenance.
      (1)    The owner or occupant or both shall keep the exterior of all
premises and every structure thereon including, but not limited to, walls,
roofs, cornices, chimneys, drains, towers, porches, landings, fire escapes,
stairs, store fronts, signs, windows, doors, awnings, and marquees in good
repair, and all surfaces thereof shall be kept painted or protected with other
approved coating or material where necessary for the purpose of preservation
and avoiding a blighting influence on adjoining properties. All obsolete signs
shall be removed, all surfaces shall be maintained free of broken glass, loose
shingles, crumbling stone or brick, peeling paint or other conditions
reflective of the deterioration or inadequate maintenance, to the end that the
property itself may be preserved safely and fire hazards eliminated and
adjoining properties and neighborhoods protected from blighting influences.
      (2)   The owner or occupant or both shall keep all premises appropriately
maintained and lawns, hedges, bushes, trees and other vegetation shall be kept
trimmed and kept from becoming overgrown and unsightly where exposed to public
view or where such vegetation may constitute a blighting influence on adjoining
properties. This provision shall not preclude the maintenance of undeveloped
land in its natural state upon which no improvements appear thereon or any
person occupies the same.
      (3)    All canopies, marquees, signs, awnings, exterior stairways, fire
escapes, standpipes, exhaust ducts, porches, balconies and similar overhanging
extensions, where exposed to public view, shall be maintained in good
condition, and shall not show evidence of discoloration, ripping, tearing or
other holes or breaks.
   (b)    Maintenance of Accessory Structures.
      (1)    All dilapidated accessory structures on any property shall be
removed or rehabilitated. For the purposes of this chapter, accessory
structures shall be defined as and have the same meaning as set forth in the
Village Zoning Ordinance. All such accessory structures which are to remain on
any premises shall provide weatherproofing, usable space and shall not harbor
rodents, termites or other vermin.
      (2)    Fences and retaining walls or similar structures shall be anchored
firmly in the ground, shall be constructed in a workmanlike manner and
maintained in the same manner so that such fences or retaining walls or similar
structures shall always be in a state of good structural repair, or in the
alternative, such fences, retaining walls, or similar structures shall be
removed or replaced. All fences shall be treated periodically with chemicals or
paint so as to retard deterioration, unless such deterioration is superficial
deterioration designed to enhance appearance.
   (c)    Removal of Miscellaneous Debris. All yards, courts or lots shal1 be
kept free of unsightly materials not appropriate to the area and debris which
may cause a fire hazard or may act as a breeding place for vermin or insects or
cause any other health hazard. (Ord. 1983-46. Passed 10-24-83. )
   (d)    Steps, Walks and Driveways. All steps, paths, walkways, porches,
drives and parking lots and parking areas shall be so constructed and
maintained as to assure safety and be kept free from deterioration and
blighting effects; if any such area, by reason of its state of repair,
constitutes a danger to health or safety, it shall be repaired or replaced.
Hazards and unsanitary conditions shall be eliminated. All driveways and walks
which exist within the public rights of way which are now paved or improved
shall be maintained in good order by and at the expense of the owner of the fee
simple title to the property.
(Ord. 1983-46. Passed 10-24-83; Ord. 1984-67. Passed 12-10-84.)
   (e)   Outdoor Storage or Parking of Motorized Vehicles Longer than 72 Hours
in Front Yards Prohibited.
      (1)   The outdoor storage or parking of vehicles for more than 72
consecutive hours shall be prohibited in each single-family residence front
yard area, including any driveways therein, between the front lot line and
front yard setback line in all lots located in residential districts except as
provided herein. In such districts, vehicles, up to a maximum of three (3) may
be stored or parked outdoors for more than 72 consecutive hours only on
permitted hard surface parking areas, provided such vehicle(s) comply with all
other applicable provisions of the Codified Ordinances of the Village. For
purposes of this Ordinance, the “front yard” means the yard extending between
the front wall of a structure and front lot line, or right-of-way, the full
width of the lot. A “yard” means that portion of the open area on a lot
extending between a structure and the nearest lot line, open and unobstructed
from the ground.
      (2)   Vehicles may be stored or parked outdoors in the front yard area
for more than 72 consecutive hours, for a period not to exceed 30 days, when
the occupant of the property can demonstrate either a bona fide emergency, a
vacation, or some other necessary extended absence from the property by the
occupant, and where no other reasonable alternative to park on such lot exists.
Mechanical failure or problems with such motorized vehicle shall not be
sufficient to justify an extension of time beyond the 48-hour time limit. The
extension shall not unreasonably exceed the time necessary in light of the
reason for the extension. Extensions of storage and parking of vehicles beyond
30 days may only be permitted after written request to the Zoning Inspector and
upon good cause shown, such as medical considerations. The prohibitions set
forth in this section shall not apply to motorized vehicles exhibiting valid
handicapped parking certifications or display.
      (3)   Whenever in the opinion of the Building Inspector, an occupant of a
lot in a residential district has regularly attempted to avoid compliance with
these restrictions on outdoor storage or parking of vehicles by temporarily
removing a vehicle(s) from the front yard area for a brief interval(s) and then
promptly returning such vehicle(s) to the front yard, the Village may treat
such vehicle(s) as if stored or parked outdoors in violation of this section.

1481.01 PURPOSE.
   The purposes of a storm water detention Plan and the criteria for such Plans
and their design are as follows:
   (a)    To permit development without increasing the flooding of other lands.
   (b)    To limit and/or reduce the adverse impact on receiving streams, storm
sewers, and other drainage facilities caused by accelerated runoff which may
result from development.
   (c)    To provide a basis of design of storm drainage systems on lands above
or below undeveloped areas which will preserve the rights and options of both
contributing and receiving property owners and assure the long-term adequacy of
storm drainage systems. (Ord. 1990-13. Passed 2-12-90.)
1481.02 REQUIREMENTS OF PLAN AND APPROVAL.
   Upon receipt of an application for a building permit for the development of
property within the Village for any of the uses described in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, the Building Department shall notify the Village Engineer of
such proposed development. When, in the opinion of the Engineer, such
development may result in significant diversion or exacerbation of storm water
runoff for the property to be developed, or adjoining properties, then the
Engineer shall notify the developer of the necessity to submit a Plan for
approval by the Engineer setting forth the manner for storm water detention to
be utilized for the development. In any case wherein the Engineer has so
determined the necessity for the submission of a storm water detention Plan, no
building permit may be issued for such proposed development until the Village
Engineer has approved such Plan in accordance with the standards set forth in
this chapter.
   The types of uses which will require notification of the Engineer by the
Building Department are:
   (a)    All commercial (including office, medical, retail, warehouse, or
similar use), industrial, recreational, institutional, public or other non-
residential developments within the Village regardless of size. Development
shall be deemed to include any improvement to land located in the Village
proposed subsequent to the effective date of this chapter, or when structures,
as defined in the Zoning Code, are added or expanded or enlarged, or where
impervious surfaces or other similar improvements are proposed to be located on
land in the Village.
   (b)    All multi-family or elderly assisted living center buildings proposed
after the effective date of this chapter. (Ord. 1990-13. Passed 2-12-90.)
1481.03 INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE SUPPLIED BY DEVELOPER TO VILLAGE ENGINEER.
   The following information shall be submitted to the Village Engineer as the
plan required under Section
1481.02.
   (a)    An overall drainage plan of the proposed development area showing
existing and proposed grading, existing and proposed runoff flow paths and
drainage facilities, contributing areas draining to the drainage system, and
the predominant soil types with runoff coefficients.
   (b)    Plan view, typical cross-sections and pertinent details of the
proposed detention basin and its primary and emergency outlet control structure
(s).
   (c)    Detention basin reservoir capacity versus reservoir water surface
elevation calculations.
   (d)    Outlet control structure discharge versus reservoir water surface
elevation hydraulic calculations, including the assumptions or calculations
made to determine the existing drainage system hydraulic gradient or water
surface elevation at the outlet control structure discharge point.
   (e)    Inflow-outflow hydrographs, both in tabular and graphical form for
the one year storm, the Critical Storm and all storms exceeding the Critical
Storm. The required inflow hydrographs shall include both pre-development and
post- development conditions.
   (f)    The assumptions and/or calculations utilized in determining the
inflow hydrographs in accordance with the accepted hydrologic methods.
   (g)    Hydraulic gradient calculations for the proposed storm drainage
system emptying into the detention basin based on the Critical Storm. Design
year and other storm design year frequencies may be required by the Village
Engineer for the storm drainage system hydraulic grading calculations, should
the Engineer deem necessary. (Ord. 1990-13. Passed 2-12-90.)
1481.04 STANDARDS FOR APPROVAL.
   After the information required in Section
1481.03 herein has been provided to the Village Engineer, the Village Engineer
may approve the storm water detention Plan for the development, provided the
following standards have been met by such proposed storm water detention Plan.
   (a)    The peak flow rate or runoff generated from the critical storm and
all more frequent storms occurring on the proposed development area does not
exceed the peak flow rate or runoff from a one year frequency, 24 hour storm
occurring on the same area under pre-development conditions.
   (b)    Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm up to the 100 year storm have peak flow runoff rates no greater
than the peak flow runoff rates from the equivalent size storms under
predevelopment conditions. Consideration of the one, two, five, ten, twenty-
five, fifty and 100 year storms will be considered adequate in designing and
developing drainage facilities to meet this standard. (Ord. 1990-13. Passed 2-
12-90.)
1481.05 CRITICAL STORM DEFINED.
   The Critical Storm for a specific development area shall be determined as
follows:
   (a)    The total volume of storm water runoff from a one year frequency 24
hour storm occurring on the development area before and after development shall
be determined. The total runoff volume shall be determined by a "Peak Discharge
Method" of calculation peak rate and total volume of runoff as described in the
U.S. Soil Conservation Service's "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,”
Technical Release No. 55 and its latest editions, including all applicable
supplements or other accepted methods as approved by the Village Engineer. This
hydrologic method shall also be utilized for all detention basin inflow design
calculations.
   (b)    Based upon the volumes calculated in subsection (a) hereof, determine
the percent increase in volume of runoff due to the development and using this
percentage, select the 24 hour Critical Storm from the following table.
If the percentage of increase in
volume of runoff is:
Equal to or greater than         Add less than The Critical Storm for discharge
                                               limitation will be
--                               10            1 Year

500                              --            100 Year
 
(Ord. 1990-13. Passed 2-12-90.)
1481.06 DEPOSIT.
   Along with the Plan to be submitted pursuant to Sections
1481.02 and
1481.03 of this chapter, the developer shall deposit the sum of one thousand
dollars ($1,000) to cover the cost and expenses of the Engineer's review
process. Such cost and expenses shall be deducted from such deposit. If
expenditures exceed the deposit, such excess shall be paid to the Building
Department by the developer upon written request. If the deposit exceeds the
expenditures, the balance shall be refunded to the applicant at the time of the
approval of the storm water detention Plan.

1486.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
      (a)    The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically
feasible and economically reasonable storm water management standards to
achieve a level of storm water quality and quantity control that will minimize
damage to property and degradation of water resources and will promote and
maintain the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Village and the
Chagrin River watershed.
      (b)    This regulation further requires the Village Engineer to prepare
and oversee procedures consistent with the requirements of law and in the best
interest of the Village and requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the Village to:
            (1)    Control stormwater runoff and ensure that all Stormwater
Control Measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed and maintained.
            (2)    Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources
that may be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)    Control the volume, rate and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and ground water are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
           (4)    Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace
subsurface storm drain systems.
      (5)    Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)    Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)    Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)    Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (9)    Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the Village's future
expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)    Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)    This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted by other action of the Village.
      (d)    Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Geauga County, and
the Village shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects initiated
after July 1, 2009, and, to the maximum extent practicable, for projects
initiated before that time.
      (e)    This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
      (f)    This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater
Management Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility
line installation that do not result in the installation of impervious surface
as determined by the Village Engineer. Such projects must be designed to
minimize the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of Chapter
1466 Erosion and Sediment Control. (Ord. 2016-40. Passed 12-12-16.)

   (a)    General. The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)    Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources.
The SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological, and chemical integrity
of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site.
Acceptable practices shall:
         (a)   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended
to support a watercourse restoration project.
         (b)   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         (c)   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         (d)   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional criteria
required by the Village Engineer, shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)    Practices designed for final use: SCMs shall be designed to
achieve the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be
compatible with the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine
maintenance.
      (3)    Stormwater management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, shall provide stormwater management and water quality controls for
the development of all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for lot
grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-
hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development runoff
patterns, volumes, and peaks from each lot.
      (4)    Stormwater facilities in water resources:  SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
1486.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with the
Village’s Erosion and Sediment Control ordinance, as determined by the Village
Engineer.
      (5)    Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels: All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)    Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
1486.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the stormwater
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing SCMs, or if
the stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by practices
defined in a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the
Village Engineer.
      (7)    Maintenance: All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the Village Engineer
as detailed in Section
1486.08.
      (8)    Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the Village, SCMs serving
multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and maintained by
an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the property owners, by the
Village. SCMs serving single lots shall be placed on these lots, protected
within an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
      (9)    Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage: Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and
grubbing practices; and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and
through these areas. Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide
perpetual management of runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving
stream's physical, chemical and biological characteristics are protected and
ecological functions are maintained.
      (10)    Preservation of Wetland Hydrology: Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters the wetlands in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope. Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology.
If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a hydrological
analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed discharge matches
the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics that support the wetland.
   (b)    Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)    Surface water protection: The Village Engineer may allow
modification to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only
if the applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from
the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and
local agencies as required in Section
 1486.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with the
Village’s Erosion and Sediment Control ordinance, as determined by the Village
Engineer. At a minimum, stream relocation designs must show how the project
will minimize changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form,
and habitat of upstream and downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges:  Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that off-
site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a
manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow:  The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as
determined by the Village Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels: Unless otherwise allowed by the Village Engineer,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with vegetated
banks and designed to carry the 10 year, 24 hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under the Village's zoning or where the use of an open drainage system
affects public health or safety, all as determined by the Village Engineer. The
following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems when necessary:
NOTE: The following sections are typical stormwater conveyance design criteria.
Either use these criteria or include the pertinent sections of your existing
stormwater conveyance design criteria.
         (a)   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5 year, 24 hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10 year, 24 hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributing drainage area within the
proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream
from the development.
         (b)   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the Village Engineer.
          (c)   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         (d)   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         (e)   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the Village:
         (a)   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25 year, 24 hour storm.
           (b)   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         (c)   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-
five (25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box
culverts and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or
conveyance must to be sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         (d)   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         (e)   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         (f)   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         (g)   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         (h)   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         (i)   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile
through a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the
100 year, 24 hour storm, or the 100 year flood elevation as determined by FEMA,
whichever is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100 year, 24 hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the Village must be
compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First consideration for
the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be given to areas
where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new floodplain
within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also be given to
enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for floodplain
fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing watershed. Unless
otherwise permitted by the Village, reductions in volume due to floodplain
fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the development.
Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must reasonably conform to
the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The use of vertical
retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
NOTE: Subsection (8) above should be coordinated with the community's riparian
setback ordinance. The requirement for compensatory floodplain storage is only
in effect when the riparian setback does not include the entire 100-year
floodplain, when the community grants a variance that allows filling in the
floodplain due to site constraints, or when the Community Engineer determines
that stream or floodplain restoration is needed to meet the objectives of this
regulation.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation:  Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control:  
      (1)   Direct runoff to an SCM:  The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more of the following SCMs. These practices are listed in
Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general
performance standards:
         A.   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         B.   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote settling,
filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured stormwater
into the ground. The Village Engineer may require a soil engineering report to
be prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed infiltration
facilities meet these performance standards.
For sites less than five (5) acres, but required to create a comprehensive
stormwater management plan, the Village Engineer may approve other SCMs if the
applicant demonstrates to the Village Engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs
meet the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
1486.09(c)(6).
         C.   For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, the Village Engineer may approve other SCMs if
the applicant demonstrates to the Village Engineer's satisfaction that these
SCMs meet the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
1486.09(c)(6), and has prior written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         D.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the Village Engineer may approve SCMs not included in Table 2 of
this regulation, but must show compliance with the current version of the Ohio
Department of Transportation "Location and Design Manual, Volume Two Drainage
Design".
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs. SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            (1)   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the Village
Engineer that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed SCMs controlling the
amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-term hourly
records, or
            (2)   Using the following equation:
               WQV = C*P*A/12
               where terms have the following meanings:
               WQV   =    water quality volume in acre-feet
               C    =   runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1
in.
               P   =    0.75 inch precipitation depth
               A   =    area draining into the stormwater practice, in acres.
Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA) for use in determining the WQv can be determined using the list in Table 1
or using the following equation to calculate the runoff coefficient:
               C=0.858i3 - 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:   
               i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
  
Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the stormwater treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is
High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
 
         B.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the stormwater practice for sediment storage. This volume
shall be incorporated into the sections of stormwater practices where
pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   Stormwater quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect against
downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.
         D.   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection Plan and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
Table 2: Draw Down Times for Stormwater Control Measures
Stormwater Control Measures                   Drain Time of WQv
Infiltration Basin or Trench1                 48 hours
Permeable Pavement - Infiltration1            48 hours
Permeable Pavement - Extended Detention       24 hours
Extended Detention Facilities
Dry Extended Detention Basin 2                48 hours

Sand and other Media Filtration 5             24 hours
Pocket Wetland 7                              24 hours
1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours
to provide storage for subsequent storm events.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended detention
basins. Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv.
3 Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQV .
4Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within 24 hours so that
there is no standing water. Shorter drawdown times are acceptable as long as
design criteria in Rainwater and Land Development have been met.
6 This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale.
7 Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv
in a pool and 75% in marshes. The EDv above the permanent pool must be equal
to the WQv.
 
 
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.   Infiltration facilities should be designed to meet all criteria
in Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site. No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities: 
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than 1/3rd of the drain time. The
outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism, maintenance, and
promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            (1)   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run
to rise ratio of 4:1 or flatter.
            (2)   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4 feet
shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8 feet and no
more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The 8 feet wide portion
of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an average depth of 6
inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation.
The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below the
permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who accidentally or
intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense vegetation in a
manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through the vegetation.
The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). The aquatic
bench shall be planted with native plant species comparable to wetland
vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged inundation.
            (3)   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets. The forebay and micropool volume shall
be equal to at least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
Note: The section below identifies the criteria that are currently be used by
the Ohio EPA to assess the equivalency of alternative practices that are not
listed in Table 2. This section can be modified to meet the needs of the
Community.
      (5)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction SCMs:
The applicant may request approval from the Village Engineer for the use of
alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the applicant shows to the
satisfaction of the Village Engineer that these SCMs are equivalent in
pollutant removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those
listed in Table 2. If the site is greater than five (5) acres, or less than
five (5) acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which
will disturb five (5) or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA is
necessary. To demonstrate the equivalency, the applicant must show:
         A.   The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State. The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a TMDL has identified water quality problems in the
receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydrologic method approved by the Village Engineer, the total volume (acre-
feet) of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development
drainage area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the
following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            4.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land use.
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description except in instances of engineered permeable pavement systems. From
the volume determined in Section
1486.09(d)(3)A., determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table
3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff is: The Critical Storm
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:              will be:

--                        10                          1 year
10                        20                          2 year
20                        50                          5 year
50                        100                         10 year
100                       250                         25 year
250                       500                         50 year
500                       ---                         100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
 
   (e)   Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects
      (1)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment
projects shall reduce existing site impervious areas by at least 20 percent. A
one-for-one credit towards the 20 percent net reduction of impervious area can
be obtained through the use of green roofs. Where site conditions prevent the
reduction of impervious area, SCMs shall be implemented to treat at least 20
percent of the WQv.
      (2)   When a combination of impervious area reduction and stormwater
quality control facilities are used, ensure a 20 percent net reduction of the
site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20 percent of the WQv,
or a combination of the two.
      (3)   Where projects are a combination of new development and
redevelopment, the total water quality volume required to be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at
100 percent water quality volume and redevelopment at 20 percent.
      (4)   Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section
1486.10 may be approved by the Village Engineer.
         (Ord. 2016-40. Passed 12-12-16.)
1486.10 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
      (a)    When the Village determines that site constraints compromise the
intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in an
improvement of water quality and a reduction of storm water quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the following standards:
            (1)    Shall achieve the same level of storm water quantity and
quality control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under
this regulation.
            (2)    Implemented in the same Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 12
watershed unit as the proposed development project.
            (3)    The mitigation ratio of the water quality volume is 1.5 to 1
or the water quality volume at the point of retrofit, whichever is greater.
            (4)    An inspection and maintenance agreement is established as
described in Chapter
 1486.08(d)(10) to ensure operations and treatment in perpetuity.
            (5)    Obtain prior written approval from Ohio EPA.
  
   (b)    Alternative actions may include, but are not limited to the following
and shall be approved by the Village Engineer:
            (1)    Fees, in an amount specified by the Village to be applied to
community- wide SCMs.
            (2)    Implementation of off-site SCMs and/or the retrofit of an
existing practice to increase quality and quantity control.
            (3)    Stream, floodplain, or wetland restoration.
            (4)    Acquisition or conservation easements on protected open
space significantly contributing to storm water control such as wetland
complexes. (Ord. 2016- 40. Passed 12-12-16.)
1486.11 EASEMENTS.
   Access to SCMs as required by the Village Engineer for inspections and
maintenance shall be secured by easements. The following conditions shall apply
to all easements:
      (a)    Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
      (b)    Easements shall be approved by the Village prior to approval of a
final plat and shall be recorded with the Geauga County Recorder and on all
property deeds.
      (c)    Unless otherwise required by the Village Engineer, access
easements between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less than 25-
feet wide. The easement shall also incorporate the entire practice plus an
additional 25-foot wide band around the perimeter of the SCM.
   (d)    The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
      (e)    Easements to structural SCMs shall be restricted against the
construction therein of buildings, fences, walls and other structures that may
obstruct the free flow of stormwater and the passage of inspectors and
maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final grade from that
described by the final grading plan approved by the Village. Any re-grading
and/or obstruction placed within a maintenance easement may be removed by the
Village at the property owner's expense. (Ord. 2016-40. Passed 12-12-16.)
1486.12 MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   (a)    To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed by the applicant and provided to the
Village Engineer:
         (1)    Final stabilization must be achieved and all permanent SCMs
must be installed and made functional, as determined by the Village Engineer
and per the approved Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
         (2)    An As-Built Certification, including As-Built Survey and
Inspection, must be sealed, signed, and dated by a Professional Engineer and a
Professional Surveyor with a statement certifying that the stormwater control
measures, as designed and installed, meet the requirements of the Comprehensive
Stormwater Management Plan approved by the Village Engineer. In evaluating this
certification, the Village Engineer may require the submission of a new set of
stormwater practice calculations if they determine that the design was altered
significantly from the approved Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan. The
As-Built Survey must provide the location, dimensions, and bearing of such

1486.15 BOND.
   (a)    If a Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan is required by this
regulation, soil-disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond
of 5% of the total project cost, has been deposited with the Village Finance
Department. This bond shall be posted for the Village to perform the
obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner of the development area as
stated in this regulation and to allow all work to be performed as needed in
the event that the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of this
regulation.
   
   (b)    The stormwater bond will be returned, less Village administrative
fees as detailed in the Village's Codified Ordinances, when the following three
criteria are met:
            (1)    After 80% of the lots of the project have been complete or
100% of the total project has been permanently stabilized or three (3) years
from the time of permanent stabilization have passed.
            (2)    An As-Built inspection of all stormwater control measures as
described in Chapter
1486.12 is approved by the Village Engineer.
            (3)    An Inspection and Maintenance Plan has been approved by the

developer, the contractor, the Village, and the private owner or homeowners
association who will take long term responsibility for these SCMs, is accepted
by the Village Engineer.
   
   (c)    Once these criteria are met, the applicant shall be reimbursed all
bond monies that were not used for any part of the project. If all of these
criteria are not met after three (3) years of permanent stabilization of the
site, the Village may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding issues with
all storm water management structures on the site and the remainder of the bond
shall be given to the private lot owner/homeowners association for the purpose
of long term maintenance of the project.
(Ord. 2016-40. Passed 12-12-16.)
1486.16 INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY STORMWATER CONTROL MEASURES.
   The applicant may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the Village Engineer. This occurs after the completion of the
final grade at the site, after all of the utilities are installed, and the site
is subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods. The
developer must provide documentation acceptable to the Village Engineer to
demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized. Upon this proof of
compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be complete and placed into
service. Upon completion of installation of these practices, all disturbed
areas and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these practices must
be stabilized within 2 days. (Ord. 2016-40. Passed 12-12-16.)

the provisions of this regulation, or fail to comply with any of such
provisions or with any lawful requirements of any public authority made
pursuant to this regulation, or knowingly use or cause or permit the use of any
lands in violation of this regulation or in violation of any permit granted
under this regulation. (Ord. 2016-40. Passed 12-12-16.)

preclude the Village instituting an appropriate action or proceeding in a Court
of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful development, or to restrain,
correct, or abate a violation, or to require compliance with the provisions of
this regulation or other applicable laws, ordinances, rules or regulations, or

1629.01 INTENT.
   It is the intent of Council to ensure the safe operation of oil and gas
wells within the municipality. Toward that end, this chapter has been adopted
to supplement any state-issued permits which authorize the drilling of an oil
and gas well within the municipality. The provisions of this chapter are based
upon local conditions which may not be known to the state at the time such
drilling was authorized. It is, further, the intent of the municipality to
exercise its local police authority, authorized under Article XVIII, Section 3
of the Ohio Constitution, to the fullest extent permitted by law for the
protection of the municipality’s residents and all emergency personnel who may
be called upon to respond to an incident at an oil and gas well.
(Ord. 2006-17. Passed 4-24-06.)
1629.02 INTERPRETATION.
   If any provision of this chapter is deemed to conflict with any
constitutional general law of the State of Ohio, the general law shall prevail.
In the event the general law of the state is silent as to any substantive
regulation contained herein, the substantive regulation established by this
chapter shall be applicable.
(Ord. 2006-17. Passed 4-24-06.)
1629.03 MUNICIPAL REGULATIONS.
   Any person who has a permit to drill for oil and gas within the Village of
South Russell which has been issued by any Department of the State of Ohio
(“Permit Holder”) shall adhere to the following regulations:
   (a)   A copy of the state-issued permit shall be filed with the Building
Department not less than fourteen (14) days before the commencement of any
operations preparatory to drilling in the Village. A copy of such permit shall
also be delivered to all owners and/or occupants of all properties which adjoin
the property where a well is to be drilled, with proof and date of such
delivery furnished to the Building Department by the Permit Holder not less
than fourteen (14) days before commencement of any operations preparatory to
drilling in the Village.
   (b)   With a copy of the permit, a letter will be filed with the Building
Department which identifies the owner(s) of the subject property where the well
is to be drilled by name and address, and identifies all persons, including but
not limited to the Permit Holder, who are responsible for the drilling and
operation of the well. The identification shall include, at a minimum, names,
addresses and work telephone numbers which shall be valid twenty-four (24)
hours a day.
   (c)   Plans for all wells, tank batteries (including tank dimensions and gas
meter types), all excavation work (including but not limited to boring pits),
fencing heights and type and site landscaping plans shall be presented to the
Building Department not less than fourteen (14) days prior to the commencement
of any drilling or other operations. These plans shall show the topography of
the site and of all vehicular access to the site from any public right-of-way.
   (d)   Plans showing all buildings on the subject premises, and all buildings
within five hundred (500) feet of the well and tank sites, shall be provided.
   (e)   No well may be drilled, or tank batteries located, in any location
where emergency vehicles (e.g., fire trucks and ambulances) cannot obtain
reasonable access to the site.
   (f)   No well is allowed to be drilled within any distance of any structure
or facility (e.g., playground) which, based upon the specific facts and
circumstances surrounding such structure or facility, creates a threat to the
health, safety and welfare of said structure or facilities or occupants or
users thereof.
   (g)   Proof of insurance shall be filed with the Building Department prior
to the commencement of drilling. The proof of insurance must establish that the
Permit Holder is insured by a solvent insurer, licensed to do business in the
State of Ohio, with limits of three million dollars ($3,000,000) per occurrence
for personal injury and property damage. The Village shall be an additional
named insured on the insurance policy.
   (h)   Emergency contact information for all persons engaged in drilling and
operating the well shall be filed with the Fire Prevention Officer and Building
Department prior to the commencement of drilling. Such information shall be
immediately updated upon any change or circumstance.
   (i)   Within thirty (30) days after drilling operations have been completed,
the Permit Holder shall do all of the following:
      (1)   Remove all bore pits, and all well spoils from the subject
property; and
      (2)   Fill all bore pits with clean fill dirt, and restore the grade of
the site to its previous elevation; and
      (3)   Seed all disturbed sites with grass or other vegetative ground
cover, and ensure such ground cover becomes established; and
      (4)   Notify the Building Inspector that the site has been restored
pursuant to the terms of this paragraph. The Building Inspector shall inspect
the site within five (5) days of the notification.
   (j)   At all times relative to the drilling, operation and capping of the
well, the well and all tank facilities shall be secured from public access by
sufficient fencing. The sufficiency of the fencing shall be determined by the
Building Commissioner.
   (k)   Within thirty (30) days after the drilling operations have been
completed, the Permit Holder shall plant sufficient vegetation which, in
conjunction with any fencing and natural vegetation, shall effectively and
permanently screen all above-ground facilities from all neighbors and from all
public and private rights- of-way while such facilities are on the subject
premises. The Building Inspector shall determine the sufficiency of the
screening and may order the Permit Holder to plant more vegetation.
   (l)   The Permit Holder shall give the Fire Prevention Officer and Building
Department at least forty-eight (48) hours notice before commencing to drill.
   (m)   A cash bond of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per well shall be
filed with the Building Commissioner to ensure sufficient securing and
screening of facilities, as provided herein, and to ensure the proper capping
of the well, the removal of all equipment and the restoration of the site after
the well is abandoned. The municipality shall return the bond upon the
restoration of the site after the well has been abandoned and all equipment has
been removed.
   (n)   Notwithstanding any other provision of these Codified Ordinances,
drilling operations may occur twenty-four (24) hours per day until the
permitted depth is reached.
   (o)   It shall be a violation of this section for a Permit Holder to violate
the terms and conditions of the state-issued permit.
   (p)   The Fire Prevention Officer and Building Department or designee shall,
within two (2) business days of receipt of the plans pursuant to Subsection (c)
hereof, review said plans and immediately advise the Permit Holder if anything
shown on the plans does not comply with the regulations set forth herein. In
the event that any Permit Holder fails to comply with the regulations herein
promulgated, the administrative official responsible for the enforcement hereof
(i.e., the Building Commissioner or Fire Prevention Officer, as designated
herein), shall provide written notice to the owner of the property and the
Permit Holder within forty-eight (48) hours of the discovery of such failure to
comply. Such service shall be made to the addresses identified in Paragraph (b)
hereof, and if no address has been provided, to any address identified on the
permit issued by the State of Ohio. The notice shall advise the owner and the
Permit Holder that if they wish to appeal the decision of the administrative
official, the time for appeal is five (5) days after service of the notice.
      (Ord. 2006-17. Passed 4-24-06.)
1629.04 APPEAL.
   Any determination of any administrative official, in applying the
regulations promulgated hereunder, which is adverse to the rights of any owner
of property or any Permit Holder may be appealed to the Planning Commission by
filing a notice of appeal with the Building Inspector within five (5) days of
notification by the administrative official that the Permit Holder has not
complied with the regulation. The appeal shall be heard at the next Planning
