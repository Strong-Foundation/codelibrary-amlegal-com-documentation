services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee’s
qualifying wages subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two

particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee’s principal
place of work:

   (C)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
subchapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division
(B)(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee’s
qualifying wages described in that division (B)(1), the employer withholds and
remits tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee’s principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the city exceeds the 20-day threshold described in
division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and remit tax to
the city for any subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer
pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the
city.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the city under
division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the city for the
first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the city.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of

year and remit that tax only to the city in which the employer’s fixed location
is located if the employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in §
35.002 of the city code.
      (2)   To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for
a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer’s federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (F)   Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of §
35.008 of the city code.
   (G)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on 12 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division
(G), a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial
classification code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year, the

the first 12 days for which the employer paid qualifying wages to the
individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on which the
individual performed services at the refinery.

provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
city; and
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
35.020(A) of the city code.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by §
35.020(A) of the city code.
      (4)   Nothing in this division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, WAGES, SALARIES, AND OTHER

         (a)   The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient; and
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (C)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator’s determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the city as
follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the city only if, regardless of where title passes, the property

         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the city from a
stock of goods located within the city; and
         (b)   The property is delivered within the city from a location
outside the city, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the city and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
city to the extent that such services are performed in the city;
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the city shall be sitused to the city;
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the city shall be sitused to the city;
and
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the city based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the city.
   (E)   (1)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the
rental of real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded
entity owned by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal
corporation in which the property generating the net profit is located and the
municipal corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net
profit resides.
      (2)   The city shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division (E) to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to the city based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the city to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of the city that imposes a

estate activity on the individual’s annual tax return for the city. The
individual may claim a credit for taxes the individual paid on such net profit
to another municipal corporation to the extent that such a credit is allowed
under the municipal income tax ordinance, or rules of the municipal corporation
of residence.
   (G)   (1)   If, in computing a taxpayer’s adjusted federal taxable income,
the taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee’s
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under division (12) of the definition for EXEMPT INCOME and division
(1)(d) of the definition for QUALIFYING WAGES in §
35.003 of this city code by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
      (2)   This division (G) applies solely for the purpose of making an
adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to the
city under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of

§ 35.007 REFUNDABLE CREDIT ALLOWED AGAINST INCOME TAX IMPOSED BY CITY FOR EACH
QUALIFYING LOSS SUSTAINED BY TAXPAYER.
   (A)   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN. A compensation plan described in
§ 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      QUALIFYING LOSS.
         (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this definition, means the
excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation the payment of which is
deferred pursuant to a non-qualified deferred compensation plan over the total
amount of income the taxpayer has recognized for federal income tax purposes
for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as compensation with respect to the
taxpayer’s receipt of money and property attributable to distributions in
connection with the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a non-qualified
deferred compensation plan, then the QUALIFYING LOSS is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a) of this
definition computed without regard to this division (b) of this definition and
a fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a non-qualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a non-qualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a QUALIFYING LOSS only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
non-qualified deferred compensation plan.
      QUALIFYING TAX RATE. The applicable tax rate for the taxable year for the
which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with respect to
any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which is
deferred pursuant to a non-qualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the QUALIFYING TAX RATE is
a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall be
based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect to
the non-qualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by the city for each
qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable year. The amount of
the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying loss and the
qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the non-qualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the non-qualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation’s proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the non-qualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the city
for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, city income tax that has been
withheld with respect to a non-qualified deferred compensation plan shall be
considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the non-qualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a non-qualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
city by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer’s qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the non-qualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer’s terms and conditions necessary to receive the non-qualified deferred
compensation.
(Ord. 2018-02, passed 2-12-2018)
§ 35.008 WITHHOLDING TAXES FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the city that imposes a tax on income in accordance with this
subchapter shall withhold from each employee an amount equal to the qualifying
wages of the employee earned by the employee in the city multiplied by the
applicable rate of the city’s income tax, except for qualifying wages for which
withholding is not required under §
35.019 of the city code or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the city the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld
or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the city in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the city in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200. Payments under this division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be
made to the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each
month; and
         (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
      (2)   Notwithstanding division (B)(1) of this section, the city may
require, and does require, by resolution, ordinance, or rule, an employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to do any of the following:
         (a)   Remit taxes deducted and withheld semimonthly to the Tax
Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the city in the preceding calendar year
exceeded $11,999, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the city in any month of the
preceding calendar year exceeded $1,000. The payment under this division (B)(2)
(a) of this section shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than one
of the following:
            1.   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld during the first 15 days of a month, the third banking
day after the fifteenth day of that month; and
            2.   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and before the first
day of the immediately following month, the third banking day after the last
day of that month.
         (b)   Make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax
Administrator of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the city if the
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required to make payments
electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes withheld on payments to
employees under § 6302 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 C.F.R. § 31,6302-1, or
any other federal statute or regulation. The payment of tax by electronic funds
transfer under this division (B)(2) does not affect an employer’s, agent’s, or
other payer’s obligation to file any return as required under this section.
   (C)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. Unless the Tax Administrator requires all individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under §
35.011 of the city code, a return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer
under this division (C) shall be accepted by a Tax Administrator and city as
the return required of an employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this subchapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee’s employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer.
   (D)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual’s disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation’s
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this subchapter or by the employer’s, agent’s, or other
payer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the city the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for
that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any city
income tax or municipal income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the city until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the city
during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if any, from
each such employee, the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee
during the preceding calendar year, the name of every other municipal
corporation for which tax was withheld or should have been withheld from such
employee during the preceding calendar year, any other information required for
federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 or
its equivalent form with respect to such employee, and other information as may
be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer’s employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer’s control. For the purposes of this division (J), a tip or gratuity is
under the employer’s control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this subchapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for
the purposes of this section.

§ 35.009 WITHHOLDING BY CASINOS AND LOTTERY SALES AGENTS.
   (A)   The city does require a casino facility or a casino operator, as
defined in § 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and R.C. § 3772.01,
respectively, or a lottery sales agent conducting video lottery terminals on
behalf of the state to withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to
amounts other than qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)   If a person’s winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which

      (1)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator shall
file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the city, providing
the name, address, and Social Security number of the person from whose winnings
amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such deduction and
withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of the winnings
from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino gaming that
resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by the Tax
Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit electronically
to the city all amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before January 31, a casino operator shall file an
annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the city in which

information return to each person with respect to whom an amount has been
deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year. The information
return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax deducted from the

division (C). The Administrator may require that such copies be transmitted
electronically.

deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   (a)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise
quits the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any

amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
            1.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid; or
            2.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
         (b)   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor
is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person’s winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)   If a person’s prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by § 6041 of
the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person’s prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the city in which the video lottery terminal
facility is located.
   (E)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the city to which the tax is owed.

agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the city
providing the names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of the persons from
whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of

information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under this division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with R.C. § 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before January 31, each video lottery terminal
sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax
Administrator of the city in which the facility is located indicating the total
amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year. The video

amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If
the name, address, or Social Security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before January 31, a video lottery sales agent
shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom an amount
has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year. The
information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax deducted
and withheld from the person’s prize award by the video lottery sales agent
during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent shall provide to the Tax
Administrator of the city a copy of each information return issued under this
division. The Tax Administrator may require that such copies be transmitted
electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)   (1)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid; or
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
      (2)   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person’s prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of the city may impose the following applicable penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to 50% of the tax deducted and
withheld; or
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of $500 for each return not filed or filed late. Interest
shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at the rate prescribed
in R.C. § 5703.47.
   (I)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of the city shall be allowed
as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the city and shall be treated
as taxes paid for purposes of §
35.016 of the city code. This division (I) applies only to the person for whom
the amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or

the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received
by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return

Administrator grants an extension of that date.

filing state income tax returns under R.C. 5747.08, a taxpayer shall

or before a prescribed date under this subchapter is delivered after that
period or that date by United States mail to the Tax Administrator or other
municipal official with which the report, claim, statement, or other document
is required to be filed, or to which the payment is required to be made, the
date of the postmark stamped on the cover in which the report, claim,

transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.

other payer as described in §
35.008 of the city code shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation

person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the return, to contact
the Tax Administrator for information about the examination or other review of
the return or the status of the taxpayer' s refund or payments, and to respond
to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator and has shown to the preparer
or other person.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator of the city shall accept for filing a generic
form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the city in
accordance with this subchapter, provided that the generic form, once completed
and filed, contains all of the information required by ordinance, resolution,
or rules adopted by the city or Tax Administrator, and provided that the
taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with
the provisions of this subchapter and of the city ordinance or resolution
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.

signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.

as in §
35.004 of the city code.
      (2)   (a)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does
not expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the city for a taxable year if both
of the following conditions apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the city for
the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed services at
a worksite location within the city; and
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the city and does
not expect to be subject to the city's income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the city. The affidavit also shall include
the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the city, make any sales in the city, or otherwise become subject to the
tax levied by the city during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the city for the taxable year, the affiant agrees
to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the
city if such a registration is required by the city's resolutions, ordinances,
or rules.” The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in this division (N)
(2) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file
any tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change. Nothing in this division (N) of this section prohibits
the Tax Administrator from performing an audit of the person.

otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity’s net profit or loss for
that taxable year:

of the following shall apply:

return shall exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in §
35.006 of the city code, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to the city; and
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this subchapter on the basis
of the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the

“taxpayer” wherever “taxpayer” appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the city in accordance with this subchapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated

in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be

electors of each of the other municipal corporations in the group, and that
unless the electors of all of the municipal corporations in the group approve
the tax in their respective municipal corporations, none of the municipal
corporations in the group shall levy the tax. Each Council also shall adopt a
resolution specifying the regular or special election date the election will be
held and directing the Board of Elections to conduct the election. At least 90
days before the date of the election, each Council shall file certified copies
of the ordinance and resolution with the Board of Elections.

municipal income tax election. For each of the municipal corporations, notice
of the election shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the
municipal corporation once a week for four consecutive weeks, or as provided in
R.C. § 7.16, prior to the election. The notice shall include a statement of the
rate and municipal corporation and school district purposes of the income tax,

income tax and agree to pay the same percentage of the tax revenue to the
school district.
   For the income tax
   Against the income tax”
   (D)   If the question is approved by a majority of the electors and
identical taxes are approved by a majority of the electors in each of the other
municipal corporations in the group, the municipal corporation shall impose the
tax beginning on January 1 of the year specified in the ordinance. The proceeds
of the levy may be used only for the specified purposes, including payment of

35.019 of the city code. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment; and
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any

reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after

against its tax on income to a taxpayer for the purpose of fostering job
retention in the city. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be
measured as a percentage of the income tax revenue the city derives from the
retained employees of the taxpayer, and shall be for a term not exceeding 15
years. Before the city passes an ordinance allowing such a credit, the city and
the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of the
credit.

§ 35.026 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   (1)   Subject to division (B) of this section, a copy of each
assessment shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal
service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. §
5703.056.
      (2)   With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the
Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as
provided in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure
electronic mail. Delivery by such means satisfies the requirements for delivery
under this section.
   (B)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056. If,
after using reasonable means, the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a
new last known address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and
considered served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after
the assessment’s postmark.
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other municipal official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local Board of Tax Review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(B)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)   (a)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by
certified mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address,
the Tax Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The
assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and
include the following statement:
“This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date.”
         (b)   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery
of the assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
         (c)   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (B)
(1)(a) of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division (B) in accordance with division (C) of this
section.
   (C)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (B) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person’s agent or the person’s affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person’s affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee’s business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (C)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
(C) prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local Board of Tax Review.
   (D)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator’s designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (E)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be stayed upon the pendency of an
appeal under this section. If an appeal is filed pursuant to this section on a
claim that has been delivered for collection, the collection activities with
respect to the assessment shall be stayed.
   (F)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      LAST KNOWN ADDRESS. The address the Tax Administrator has at the time a
document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the Tax
Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a change
of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery
service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      UNDELIVERABLE ADDRESS. An address to which the postal service or an
authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to deliver an
assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for nondelivery is
because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the assessment.

§ 35.027 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
city, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of
employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the city:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than $10; and
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds $10.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor’s claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
city official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)(3) of this
section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose
request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment shall state the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
35.019 of the city code.
   (C)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request;
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day; or
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)   As used in this section, WITHHOLDING TAX has the same meaning as in §
35.032 of the city code.
(Ord. 2018-02, passed 2-12-2018)
§ 35.028 VERIFICATION OF ACCURACY OF RETURNS.
   (A)   A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this subchapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this subchapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this subchapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator’s
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of the city may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the city or for the withholding of such tax.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal income tax returns in such person’s possession or control.
The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant,
bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This
division (C) does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an
attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 2018-02, passed 2-12-2018)
§ 35.029 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   Nothing in this subchapter shall limit the authority of a Tax Administrator
to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the performance of
such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of the Revised

taxpayer’s assigns, or legal representative as provided in this subchapter;
   (E)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to the

appeal or application is withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed,
or is otherwise final;
   (H)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law; and

   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this subchapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds

dollar that is less than $0.50 shall be dropped. If a person chooses to round
amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts entered on
the document.

   (A)   Nothing in this subchapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person’s Social Security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   When transmitting or otherwise making use of a tax document that
contains a person’s Social Security number, the Tax Administrator shall take
all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that the number is not capable of

number so that it is not readily discernible by the general public. The Tax
Administrator shall not put a person’s Social Security number on the outside of
any material mailed to the person.
   (C)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying

35.032 of the city code, in addition to any applicable penalty described in §
35.999 of the city code.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this subchapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to §
35.032 of the city code.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

to any applicable criminal penalties described in §
35.999 of the city code for a violation of §
35.036 of the city code and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.

§ 35.033 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, CLAIM means a claim for an amount payable to
the city that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in accordance

      (1)   Compromise a claim; or
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may consider the following standards when
ascertaining with respect to a claim whether a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement is in the best interests of the city.
      (1)   There exists a doubt as to whether the claim can be collected.
      (2)   There exists a substantial probability that, upon payment of the
claim and submission of a timely request for refund with respect to that

agreement would facilitate effective tax administration.

innocent spouse, provided that any relief under this standard shall only affect

shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.

or ordinance, to adopt rules to administer an income tax imposed by the city in
accordance with this subchapter. Such rules shall not conflict with or be
inconsistent with any provision of this subchapter. All rules adopted under

preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement, claim,

counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based

Administrator and of the taxpayer during an audit and a statement of the
taxpayer’s rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.

is entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant,
bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a
form by which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
      (2)   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer’s attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This
division (C) does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an
attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.

this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer’s case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.

which the city is located, if all of the following apply:
      (1)   In the action or omission the Tax Administrator, the Tax
Administrator’s employee, or the employee of the city frivolously disregards a
provision of this subchapter or a rule or instruction of the Tax Administrator;

subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator

of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.

with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has

§ 35.041 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax Administrator in
such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual return to
determine the tax due levied by the city in accordance with this subchapter
must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal income
tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the Internal Revenue Service,
and such alteration affects the taxpayer’s tax liability under this subchapter.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer’s consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as provided
under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not reopen
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed
return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment
to the taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return unless the applicable
statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under §
35.020 of the city code has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division (C) within the period prescribed by §
35.020(E) of the city code for filing the amended return even if it is filed
beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is $10 or less, no
refund need be paid by the city to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in §
35.019 of the city code. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

§ 35.043 MUNICIPAL INCOME TAX NET OPERATING LOSS REVIEW COMMITTEE.
   (A)   There is hereby created the municipal income tax net operating loss
review committee for the purpose of evaluating and quantifying the potential
fiscal impact to municipal corporations levying an income tax of requiring such
municipal corporations to allow taxpayers to carry forward net operating losses
for five years. The committee is a public body for the purposes of R.C. §
121.22.
   (B)   (1)   The committee shall be composed of the following members:

by the Speaker of the House of Representatives;
         (d)   Three members representing municipal corporations that levy an
income tax in calendar year 2016, appointed by the President of the Senate. At

section shall represent municipal corporations that do not allow taxpayers to
carry forward net operating losses to future taxable years; and
         (e)   One member appointed by the governor, who shall serve as the
Chairperson of the committee.
      (2)   An appointed member shall serve until the member resigns or is
removed by the member’s appointing authority. Vacancies shall be filled in the
same manner as original appointments. A vacancy on the committee does not
impair the right of the other members to exercise all the functions of the
committee. The committee shall meet at the call of the Chairperson. The
presence of a majority of the members of the committee constitutes a quorum for
the conduct of business of the committee. The concurrence of at least a
majority of the members of the committee is necessary to approve the report
issued by the committee under division (D) of this section. Members of the
committee shall not be compensated or reimbursed for members’ expenses.
   (C)   (1)   As used in this section, REPORTING MUNICIPAL CORPORATION means
any municipal corporation that does not allow net operating losses incurred
before January 1, 2017, to be carried forward and utilized to offset income or
net profit generated in such municipal corporation in future taxable years.
      (2)   (a)   On or before August 31, 2021, each reporting municipal
corporation shall report to the municipal income tax net operating loss review
committee the difference between:
            1.   The municipal corporation’s actual municipal income tax
revenue received for taxable years ending in 2018 and 2019; and
            2.   The projected amount of municipal income tax revenue that the
municipal corporation would have received for taxable years ending in 2018 and
2019 if the municipal corporation were not required to allow net operating
losses incurred in prior taxable years to be carried forward to taxable years
ending in 2018 or 2019.
         (b)   Each municipal corporation’s calculations shall be made using
the microsimulation model adopted by the committee at its meeting on May 5,
2016, but applied to taxable years ending in 2018 and 2019.
   (D)   The municipal income tax net operating loss review committee shall
review the information reported by municipal corporations under division (C) of
this section and calculate the total of the revenue effects reported by such
municipal corporations. On or before May 1, 2022, the committee shall issue a
written report to the Speaker and Minority Leader of the House of
Representatives and the President and Minority Leader of the Senate reporting
the committee’s findings and the estimated revenue impact of requiring
municipal corporations levying an income tax to allow net operating loss to be
carried forward for five years. The report shall contain recommendations to
address revenue shortfalls, which may include, but which shall not be limited
to, the use of supplemental funds from the local government fund to mitigate
those shortfalls.
   (E)   Nothing in this section delays or otherwise affects the taxable years
to which division (3) of the definition for NET PROFIT in §
35.003 of the city code applies as prescribed in that division.
   (F)   The municipal income tax net operating loss review committee shall
cease to exist on May 1, 2022.

§ 35.045 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in §§
35.045 to
35.060 of the city code that is not otherwise defined in this subchapter is
used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to
federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in R.C. Title
LVII, unless the term is defined in R.C. Chapter 5703, in which case the
definition in that subchapter shall control. Any reference in this subchapter
to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United States related
to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this section and §
35.003 of the city code, the definition in this section shall control for all
uses of that term in §§
35.045 to
35.060 of the city code. For the purpose of this subchapter, and as used in §§
35.045 to
35.060 of the city code only, the following definitions shall apply unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME.
      (1)   For a person required to file as a C corporation, or for a person
that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation as described in division (5) of
the definition for NET PROFIT in §
35.003 of the city code, means a C corporation’s federal taxable income before
net operating losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal
Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
         (a)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income;
         (b)   Add an amount equal to 5% of intangible income deducted under
division (1)(a) of this definition, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in § 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (c)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in §§ 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
         (d)   1.   Except as provided in division (1)(d)2. of this definition,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in §§ 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code; and
            2.   Division (1)(d)1. of this definition does not apply to the
extent the income or gain is income or gain described in §§ 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
         (e)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;
         (f)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;
         (g)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under R.C. § 4313.02;
         (h)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income;
         (i)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer’s federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group’s federal taxable income in accordance with §
35.051(E)(3)(b) of the city code; and
         (j)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer’s federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group’s federal taxable income in accordance with §
35.051(E)(3)(b) of the city code.
      (2)   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity
that has made the election described in division (2) of the definition for
TAXPAYER in §
35.003 of the city code, and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made
the election described in division (5) of the definition for NET PROFIT in §
35.003 of the city code, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable
income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except
guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall
not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under §
469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations. Amounts
paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with respect to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for
a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall
not be allowed as a deduction. Nothing in this definition shall be construed as
allowing the taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be
construed as allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for
purposes of federal self-employment tax.

to §
35.055 of the city code.

   TAX RETURN or RETURN. The notifications and reports required to be filed
pursuant to §§
35.044 to
35.060 of the city code for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes,
and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   TAXABLE YEAR. The calendar year or the taxpayer’s fiscal year ending during
the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the calculation of
the taxpayer’s adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant to this
subchapter. If a taxpayer’s taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of §§
35.044 to
35.060 of the city code is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
Tax Administrator may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   TAXPAYER. The same meaning as in §
35.003 of the city code, except that TAXPAYER does not include natural persons
or entities subject to the tax imposed under R.C. Chapter 5745. TAXPAYER may
include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons are
required to assume the role of a taxpayer.

section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer’s business activity in
the city, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator may require, that
the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the

      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
35.055(A) of the city code.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by §
35.055(A) of the city code.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, WAGES, SALARIES, AND OTHER

under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)   The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient; or

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer; and
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (C)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator’s determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the city as

stock of goods located within the city; and
         (b)   The property is delivered within the city from a location
outside the city, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the city and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
city to the extent that such services are performed in the city.

tangible personal property is used in the city.
   (E)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the city in which
the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent or
broker shall be allocated to the city based upon the ratio of the commissions
the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
located in the city to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)   (1)   If, in computing a taxpayer’s adjusted federal taxable income,
the taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee’s
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under division (12) of the definition for EXEMPT INCOME and division
(1)(d) of the definition for QUALIFYING WAGES in §
35.003 of the city code by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
      (2)   This division (F) applies solely for the purpose of making an
adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to a
municipal corporation under this section.
   (G)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner’s ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

share of such earnings shall equal the proportion that the municipal
corporation’s certified tax payment is of the total taxes certified to all
municipal corporations in that quarter. All investment earnings on money in the
municipal income tax fund shall be credited to that fund.
   (B)   If the Tax Administrator determines that the amount of tax paid by a
taxpayer and distributed to a municipal corporation under this section for a

otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following with
respect to that pass-through entity’s net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the

the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in §
35.046 of the city code, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to the city; and
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with §§
35.044 to
35.060 of the city code on the basis of the entity’s net profits that would
otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under §
35.046 of the city code by substituting “consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to” for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in
that section and by substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for
“taxpayer” wherever “taxpayer” appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under §§
35.044 to

the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or
more members of such an affiliated group.

will not accurately reflect the taxpayer’s tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the Administrator shall immediately forward the payment to the Treasurer of
state. The Treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in §
35.049(B) of the city code.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
R.C. § 5703.47 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment,
unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E)
of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment; and
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under §§
35.044 to
35.060 of the city code and shall be credited and distributed to the city in
accordance with §
35.047 of the city code.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due; and
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a municipal income tax return for
that year.

§ 35.054 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by §§
35.044 to
35.060 of the city code or R.C. Chapter 5703, the following penalties shall
apply.
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under §§
35.044 to

prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the Tax Administrator,
the Administrator may impose a penalty not exceeding $25 per month or fraction
of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the due
date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on which the return is
filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this division (A)(1) shall
not exceed $150.
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under §§
35.044 to
35.060 of the city code fails to do so, the Administrator may impose a penalty
not to exceed the following:
         (a)   For each of the first two failures, 5% of the amount required to
be reported on the return; and
         (b)   For the third and any subsequent failure, 10% of the amount
required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under §
35.044 of the city code fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be
paid under this subchapter, the Administrator may impose a penalty equal to 15%
of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by §§
35.044 to
35.060 of the city code that does not contain information upon which the
substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of §§
35.044 to
35.060 of the city code, a penalty of up to $500 may be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under §§
35.044 to
35.060 of the city code, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
$1,000 or 100% of the tax required to be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
§
35.056 of the city code, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
$1,000 or 100% of the claim. Any penalty imposed under this division, any
refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund from the date of the
refund, may be assessed under §
35.056 of the city code without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the Tax Administrator. The Administrator
may adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under §§
35.044 to
35.060 of the city code and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required
to be distributed to such municipal corporations under §
35.047 of the city code.

§ 35.055 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)   (1)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under §§
35.044 to
35.060 of the city code fails to file the return within the time prescribed,
files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for
the period covered by the return, the Tax Administrator may make an assessment
against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the return or
tax is due, based upon any information in the Administrator’s possession.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall not make or issue an assessment against
a taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the Administrator consent
in writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year
time limit in §
35.056 of the city code for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or
limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject
to assessment as required by §§
35.044 to
35.060 of the city code, or that files a fraudulent return. The Administrator
shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided
in R.C. § 5703.37. With the notice, the Administrator shall provide
instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the
petition.
   (B)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Administrator within
60 days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the Treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer’s
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the Administrator prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the Administrator shall proceed under R.C. §
5703.60.
   (C)   (1)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the
assessment remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the
Tax Administrator’s entry making the assessment final may be filed in the
office of the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the
taxpayer has an office or place of business in this state, the county in which
the taxpayer’s statutory agent is located, or Franklin County.
      (2)   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a
judgment against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The
judgment may be filed by the Clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled “special
judgments for municipal income taxes”, and shall have the same effect as other
judgments. Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax
Administrator, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
      (3)   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within 60 days after
the day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of
tax due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47
from the day the Administrator issues the assessment until the assessment is
paid or until it is certified to the Attorney General for collection under R.C.
§ 131.02, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is
certified to the Attorney General for collection, the entire unpaid portion of
the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. §
5703.47 from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be
collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (D)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the city to which the money is
owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)   If the Tax Administrator believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the Administrator may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the Administrator shall file an entry with the clerk of
the court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this
section. Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer
assessed or the taxpayer’s legal representative in the manner provided in R.C.
§ 5703.37 within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk. The total
amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer assessed
files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of this
section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the Administrator and
in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment. Full
or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the Administrator’s
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is
pending, the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the
subject of the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the Treasurer of state
does not prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the
petition.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon petition so filed or
pursuant to a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals or any court to which the
determination or decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the
taxpayer under the corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there
shall be issued to the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund
in the amount of the overpayment as provided by §
35.056 of the city code, with interest on that amount as provided by that
section.

35.044 to

Administrator within three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or
excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period allowed by §
35.055(A) of the city code. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the Tax Administrator
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than $10 and not less than that claimed,
the Administrator shall certify that amount to the Director of Budget and
Management and the Treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in R.C. § 5703.052. If the amount is greater than $10 but less than
that claimed, the Administrator shall proceed in accordance with R.C. §
5703.70.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the Administrator
shall notify the city of the amount refunded to the taxpayer attributable to
the city, which shall be deducted from the city’s next distribution under §
35.047 of the city code.
   (C)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within 90 days after such determination shall bear interest
at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the ninety-first day
after such determination until the day the refund is paid or credited. On an
illegal or erroneous assessment, interest shall be paid at that rate from the
date of payment on the illegal or erroneous assessment until the day the refund
is paid or credited.

§ 35.057 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under §
35.044 of the city code and used to determine the tax due under §§
35.044 to
35.060  of the city code must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the
Internal Revenue Service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer’s tax
liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
the Tax Administrator in such form as the Administrator requires. The amended
return shall be filed not later than 60 days after the adjustment is agreed
upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes or after any federal
income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting
therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer
intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to
amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based
on the taxpayer’s consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall
notify the Administrator before filing the amended return.
   (B)   In the case of an underpayment; the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under §
35.055 of the city code for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due
under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest. The
amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal tax return.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be
filed under this division (C) within the 60-day period prescribed for filing
the amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
§
35.056 of the city code, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division (C)
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer’s federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the
time prescribed in §
35.056 of the city code.
      (2)   The application shall not reopen those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments that are not affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal income tax return.

may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to §§

made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under
those sections. Upon written request by the Administrator or a duly authorized
agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this
section is required to furnish the opportunity for the Administrator,
authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers,

during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six years
following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents relate,
unless the Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction within that
period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Administrator may
require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep such records as
the Administrator determines necessary to show whether or not that person is
liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by the
city.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person’s possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

35.023 or
35.024 of the city code, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such
existing agreement.

§ 35.077 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
    Subject to provisions of §
35.079, an annual tax, for the purposes specified in §
35.075, shall be, and is hereby levied on and after November 11, 1986, at the
rate of 1.5% per annum upon the following:
   (A)   On all income, qualifying wages, including sick and vacation pay,
commissions, and other compensation earned during the effective period of this
subchapter by residents;
   (B)   On all income, qualifying wages, including sick and vacation pay,
commissions, and other compensation earned during the effective period of this
subchapter, by nonresidents for work done or service performed by a resident
employer;
   (C)   On the portion attributable to the municipality of the net profits
earned during the effective period of this subchapter of all resident
associations, unincorporated businesses, professions, or other entities,
derived from sales made, work done, or services performed or rendered, or
business or other activities conducted in the municipality;
   (D)   On a resident partner's or owner's share of the net profits earned
during the effective period of this subchapter of a resident association or
other unincorporated entity, not attributable to the municipality and not
levied against the association or other unincorporated entity;
   (E)   On the portion attributable to the municipality of the net profits
earned during the effective period of this subchapter, of all nonresident

or other activities conducted in the municipality, whether or not the

in the municipality;
   (F)   On a resident partner's or owner's share of the net profits earned
during the effective period of this subchapter of a nonresident association or

subchapter of all corporations derived from sales made, work done, or services
performed or rendered, and business or other activities conducted in the
municipality, whether or not the corporations have an office or place of
business in the municipality; and
   (H)   The Tax Administrator may establish a schedule of percentages setting
forth the portion of income taxable attributable to a taxpayer residing outside
of the city limits but engaged in activities producing taxable income only
partially or part-time in the city. Such percentages shall be in increments of
25% and the determination of the Administrator shall be final, based upon the
written application of a taxpayer or employer. Such determinations shall be
reviewed every three years and may be adjusted automatically by the
Administrator with or without notice. The present schedule of percentages shall
remain in effect until the start of the 1996 tax year.
   (I)   As used in this division:
      (1)   QUALIFYING REMOTE EMPLOYEE OR OWNER means an individual who is an
employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
         (a)   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
         (b)   The individual is permitted or required to perform services for
the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
      (2)   QUALIFYING REMOTE WORK LOCATION means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
QUALIFYING REMOTE WORK LOCATION may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
      (3)   REPORTING LOCATION means either of the following:
         (a)   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
         (b)   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer or
client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under this Chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
      (4)   QUALIFYING REPORTING LOCATION means one of the following:
         (a)   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
         (b)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee or
owner under this section, the reporting location in this state at which the
employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or periodically reports during the
taxable year;
         (c)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee or
owner under this section, the location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as
the employee's or owner's qualifying reporting location, provided the
assignment is made in good faith and is recorded and maintained in the
taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may change the qualifying reporting
location designated for an employee or owner under this division at any time.
      (5)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division of this section apply to such apportionment except
as otherwise provided in this division.
         (a)   A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division
in writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a
timely filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an
assessment. The election applies to the taxable year for which that return or
appeal is filed and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer
revokes the election.
         (b)   The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         (c)   After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election
applies to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business.
The taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         (d)   Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (6)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division of
this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election.
      (7)   For the purpose of this section, the average original cost of any
tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote employee or owner at
that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that
individual's qualifying reporting location.
      (8)   For the purpose of this section, any wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying remote employee or
owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying remote work
location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
      (9)   For the purpose of this section, any gross receipts of the business
or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
      (10)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in this section. However, a tax administrator shall not require an
alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would require a
taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation solely
because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (11)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages.

the municipality and who receives salaries, wages, commissions, or other
compensation or net profits from sales made, work done, or services performed
or rendered outside of the municipality, if it be made to appear that he or she
has paid a municipal income tax on the income taxable under this subchapter, to
another municipality, shall be allowed a credit for the tax paid, against the
tax imposed by this subchapter in an amount not to exceed the tax due the city
under this subchapter.

§§
35.097 and
35.098, or any other provisions inconsistent herewith, a claim for refund or
credit under this section shall be made in a manner as the Tax Administrator
may by regulation provide. No claim for refund or credit shall be allowed
unless made on or before the date of filing the taxpayer’s final return, unless
the taxpayer’s employer files with the Tax Administrator a list showing the tax
withheld from the taxpayer’s wages, salaries, or commissions for other
municipalities.

§ 35.080 ALLOCATION OF NET PROFITS.
   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without
the boundaries of the municipality shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the municipality for purposes of this tax in the same proportion as
the average ratio of:
   (A)   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal property
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the city during
the taxable period to the average original cost of all the real and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
during the same period, wherever situated. REAL PROPERTY includes property
rented or leased by the taxpayer, and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereupon by eight;
   (B)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period
to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed in the
city to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the same period to
persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their services are
performed. Wages, salaries, and other compensation shall be included to the
extent that they represent qualifying wages; and
   (C)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the city to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.

§ 35.081 OPERATING LOSS CARRY-FORWARD.
   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year, beginning
with December 1, 1971, allocable to the municipality, may be applied against
the portion of the profit of succeeding tax years, allocable to the
municipality, until exhausted, but in no event for more than the five taxable
years immediately following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of
a net operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior
year. The portion of a net operation loss sustained shall be allocated to the
municipality in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits
to the municipality.

§ 35.082 CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
    Filing of consolidated returns may be permitted or required in accordance
with rules and regulations prescribed by the Tax Administrator. In the case of
a corporation that carried on transactions with its stockholders or with other
corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates, or some
other method, the Tax Administrator shall require any information, in addition
to the return hereinafter required, as he or she may deem necessary to
ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the municipality. If
the Tax Administrator finds net profits are not properly allocated to the
municipality by reason of transactions with stockholders or with other
corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates, or some
other method, he or she may require the filing of a consolidated return or
adjust the transactions so as to produce a fair and proper allocation of net
profits to the municipality.

other activities, as defined in this subchapter, earned or received on and
after December 1, 1971.

§ 35.084 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)    Each taxpayer or person who engages in business as hereinbefore
defined, or whose earnings, wages, salaries, commissions, or other compensation
are subject to the tax imposed by this subchapter, shall, whether or not a tax
is due thereon, make and file a return on or before April 15 of each year with
the Tax Administrator. When the return is made for a fiscal year or other
period different from the calendar year, the return shall be filed within four
months from the end of such fiscal year or other period.
   (B)   A husband and wife may, for any tax year, elect to file separate or
joint returns. However, a loss from the business activity of one spouse may not
be used to reduce the taxable income of the other spouse. Also, a loss from the
operation of a business, including rental losses, may not be used to offset the
income on a taxpayer's W-2 Form.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator is hereby authorized to provide by regulation,
subject to the approval of the Board of Review, that the W-2 Form furnished by
an employer or employers, for a nonresident employee showing the full amount of
tax deducted by such employer or employers from the income, qualifying wages or
commissions or other compensation and paid to the city, or other municipality
or state, imposing a tax equal to or greater than the city income tax, on the
same taxable income, shall be accepted as the return required of a nonresident
employee under this subchapter, whose sole income subject to the tax or taxes
under this subchapter is such salary, wages, commissions, or other
compensation.
   (D)   Such return shall be filed with the Tax Administrator on a form or
forms furnished by or obtainable from the Administrator on a generic form,
setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of income, qualifying wages, commissions and
other compensation earned or received;
      (2)   Gross receipts from such business less allowable expenses incurred
in the acquisition of such gross receipts to arrive at a net profit;
      (3)   The amount of the tax imposed by this subchapter thereon;
      (4)   Any credits to which the taxpayer may be entitled; tax withheld by
employer, estimated tax payments and tax paid to another municipality; and
      (5)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, or other
information as the Tax Administrator may require, including, but not limited
to, copies of all W-2 Forms, Form 1099 miscellaneous income forms, page one of
Form 1040, page one and two of Form 1120, 1120S (including K-1), 2106, 1065,
Schedule C, Schedule E, Schedule F and any other federal schedules, if
applicable.
   (E)   The taxpayer making a return required hereunder shall, at the time of
the filing thereof, pay to the Administrator the balance of the tax, due if it
exceeds $0.99.
      (1)   Should the return or the records of the Tax Administrator indicate
an overpayment of the tax to which the city is entitled under the provisions of
this subchapter, such overpayment shall be first applied against any existing
tax liability, penalties, or interest, and the balance, if any, at the election
of the taxpayer communicated to the Tax Administrator, shall be refunded or
applied against any liability hereunder; provided that any overpayment of less
than $1 shall not be refunded but may be carried forward to a subsequent tax
year.
      (2)   Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a return of
tax overpaid. Such amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request from
the Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the annual return.
      (3)   Within three months from the determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's city tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended city return showing income subject to the city tax based
upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon or make claim for return of any overpayment.
   (F)   The officer or employee of such employer having control or supervision
or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making the payment,
shall be personally liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax,
penalties, or interest due as required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy, or
reorganization of any such employer does not discharge an officer or employee's
liability for a prior failure of such business to file a return or pay taxes,
penalties, or interest due.
   (G)   The tax return is considered received:
      (1)   If mailed, on the date postmarked by the United States postal
service; or
      (2)   On the date delivered without mailing to the city tax office.
   (H)   Extension of time for filing return. Taxpayers granted extensions of
time for filing their federal income tax returns may have an extension for
filing their city tax return, provided that a copy of the federal extension is
filed with the Tax Administrator on or before the original due date of the city
tax return. The Administrator may deny a request for extension if the request
is not filed by the original due date or the taxpayer is delinquent in anyway.
The granting of an extension does not extend the due date for payments required
by this subchapter, and payments after the due date regardless of the granting
of an extension will be subject to interest and penalties; however, no penalty
shall be assessed solely upon the tax due upon the return for which the
extension is granted. All extensions are granted subject to review of the Tax
Administrator to determine if all payments and declarations are made when due,
and if later found delinquent, the extension may be nullified. For tax years
ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of the city's income
tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the 15th day of
the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return
relates.
   (I)   The failure of any taxpayer to receive or procure a return,
declaration or other required form shall not excuse the taxpayer from filing
such forms or from paying the tax due.
   (J)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under this section, the Tax Administrator shall not make any
inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer with regard to the return on or
before the date the taxpayer files the return or on or before the extended due
date to file the return, whichever occurs first. If a tax administrator
violates this division, the city shall reimburse the taxpayer for any
reasonable costs incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
This does not apply to an extension, if the tax administrator has actual
knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required.

§ 35.085 TAXATION AND FINANCE; MUNICIPAL FUNDS.
   (A)   Dates and exemptions. Each person who, engaged in business, or whose
salary, wages, commissions, or other compensation are subject to the tax
imposed by this subchapter shall, and each resident, whether or not a tax is
due thereon, make and file, on or before April 15 in each year, a return with
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer on a fiscal year accounting basis for federal
income tax purposes shall, beginning with his or her first fiscal year, any
part of which falls within the effective period of this subchapter, file his or
her return within four months from the end of the fiscal year or period. The
Tax Administrator is hereby authorized to provide by regulation that the return
of an employer or employers, showing the amount of tax deducted by the employer
or employers from the salaries, wages, commissions, or other compensation of an
employee, and paid by him, her or them to the Tax Administrator, shall be
accepted as the return required of any employee whose sole income, subject to
tax under this subchapter, is the salary, wages, commissions, or other
compensation.
   (B)   Returns and contents thereof. The return shall be filed with the Tax
Administrator on a form furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Tax
Administrator, setting forth the following:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions, and other
compensation earned, and gross income from any business, profession, or other
activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of the gross
income earned during the preceding year and subject to the tax;
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this subchapter on the earnings
and profits; and
      (3)   Any other pertinent statements, information returns, or other
information as the Tax Administrator may require, including a statement that
the figures used in the return are the figures used in the return for federal
income tax, adjusted to set forth only that income as is taxable under the
provisions of this subchapter.
   (C)   Payment with returns. The taxpayer making a return shall at the time
of the filing thereof pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as
due thereon; however, where the source, pursuant to the provisions of §§
35.086 through
35.089 or where any portion of the tax has been paid by the taxpayer, pursuant
to the provisions of §
35.090, or where an income tax creditable against the city tax pursuant to §
35.078 has been paid to another municipality, credit for the amount so paid
shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance, if any,
shall be due and payable at the time of filing a return. A taxpayer who has
overpaid the amount of tax to which the municipality is entitled under the
provisions of this subchapter may have the overpayment applied against any
subsequent liability hereunder or as his or her election indicated on the
return, the overpayment, or part thereof, shall be refunded. However, no
additional taxes or refunds of less than $1 shall be collected or refunded.
   (D)   Amended returns. Where necessary an amended return must be filed in
order to report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a
refund or tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and limitations contained
in §§
35.078,
35.097, and
35.098, the amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Tax Administrator. Within three months from the final determination of any
federal tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s city tax liability, the taxpayer
shall make and file an amended city return, showing income subject to the
municipality tax based upon the final determination of federal tax liability,
and pay any additional tax shown thereon, or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.

§ 36.056 CITY-WIDE CASH HANDLING POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. The cash handling policy is established for the purpose of
ensuring adequate internal controls to account for the handling of the City of
Hillsboro's ("city") municipal cash and to maintain public trust. The
procedures to enforce and controls to ensure that this cash handling policy is
carried out are to include but are not limited to those outlined below:
      (1)   Written documentation evidencing assigned authority (see cash
handling policy employee acknowledgment form as attached to Ord. 2024-15); and
      (2)   Random drawer audits conducted under the direction of the City
Auditor. A requirement that any non-compliance with this policy or deviation
from set procedures will be reported to the City Auditor in the form of a
memorandum outlining the non-compliant act or procedural deviation.
   (B)   Delegation of authority.
      (1)   The City Auditor is authorized to promulgate rules for establishing
procedures for the receipt, handling, and deposit of municipal cash by
municipal employees and persons performing cash handling functions where there
are municipal operations being performed, and funds that are to be placed into
the municipal treasury. For the purpose of this policy, city employees,
employees of companies that perform services operating departments or
facilities for the city, volunteers, and all other persons involved in cashier
related functions involving municipal cash, whether the employee(s) is/are full
or part-time, are covered by the terms of this policy. Incorporated within the
authority granted via this policy is the right to require regular reporting to
the City Auditor and the right to inspect departmental cash records, including
overages or shortages and inspection of departmental practices and procedures
in handling municipal cash. The City Auditor may verify and inspect for
compliance with promulgated policies, procedures and rules to assure that they
are being adhered to through on-site inspections.
      (2)   The city is required by law to keep detailed records of
transactions involving the receipting, retention, and disbursement of all city
revenue. The Auditor's office is charged with the responsibility of overseeing
the proper receipting and safeguarding of all municipal funds.
      (3)   Responsibility and accountability for the daily collection of funds
is delegated to the principal municipal cash custodian of each operating
location involved in cashiering operations along with his/her supervisor.
   (C)   Duties of city personnel. Any city employee who receives municipal
cash in the normal scope and course of his/her duties shall:
      (1)   Ensure the delivery or deposit is made in compliance with R.C. §
9.38 and comply with rules promulgated by the City Auditor for handling and
processing of municipal cash;
      (2)   Notify his/her supervisor and department head of any loss or theft
of municipal money immediately upon discovery. Written notice shall be given to
them no later than 24 hours after discovery;
      (3)   Shall count, balance, report and relinquish cash drawer collections
in excess of the cash drawer amount to the facility's principal municipal cash
custodian no later than the end of his/her shift each day;
      (4)   Each cash custodian/the department head or manager shall prepare
deposit records and deposit the day's collections in accordance with the
following process:
         (a)   City personnel must deposit all public moneys received by that
person with the City Auditor's office or properly designated depository (bank)
on the business day next following the day of receipt, if the total amount of
such moneys received exceeds $1,000. If the total amount of the public moneys
so received does not exceed $1,000, the person shall deposit the moneys within
three business day next following the day of receipt, provided the person is
able to safeguard the moneys until such time.
         (b)   Safeguarding the public moneys include proper segregation of
duties on handling the cash (signoffs, reviews); securing cash received for
deposit in a locked safe within a secured area; and restricted access to the
safe. This process must be approved by the City Auditor;
      (5)   Municipal employees are subject to disciplinary action for failure
to comply with the
duties described in the cash handling policy.
   (D)   Liability for loss. Primary responsibility for care and liability for
loss of municipal cash in its custody is recognized at the department/facility
level until deposited with the City Auditor's office or bank. Compliance with
the procedures approved by the City Auditor establishes a presumption that a
municipal department/facility is exercising due care in its custody and care of
municipal cash.
   (E)   Establishment/increase of cash funds. All requests for the
establishment of cash funds, (i.e. cash drawer and petty cash funds) must be
made to the City Auditor. The City Auditor will maintain a complete listing of
all cash funds. The department/facility, custodian and the dollar value of the
cash funds are to be maintained on this written listing.
      (1)   A check request signed by the department head specifying the type
of fund (cash drawer or petty cash), the amount being requested, and an
explanation describing the basis for the requested funds is required to be
submitted to the City Auditor (email is acceptable).
      (2)   It is not permissible for cash funds to be established out of cash
receipts by any department/facility.
      (3)   A cash fund will not be established until a cash fund custodian has
been designated by the department head/facility manager. Cash funds must have
only one cash fund custodian responsible for managing cash funds. In the
absence of the cash fund custodian, the supervisor is responsible for the
control and management of cash funds.
      (4)   Should it become necessary to change fund custodians, the
supervisor must notify the City Auditor and an audit of the cash fund be
performed prior to transferring the cash fund to a new cash fund custodian. An
audit of the cash fund will not be performed unless and until the new custodian
is present.
      (5)   Upon receipt of the cash fund money, the new custodian will sign
the custodian acknowledgment form maintained by the City Auditor.
   (F)   Termination of cash funds.
      (1)   When the need arises to close a municipal cash fund, the department
head/facility manager shall notify the City Auditor that the cash fund is to be
closed by providing a memorandum (email is acceptable) specifying the reason
for the closure. At the point funds are to be relinquished, an audit of the
cash fund shall be performed in the presence of the department head/facility
manager or the municipal cash fund custodian. Any discrepancy from the proper
balance shall be noted and addressed at that time. The City Auditor shall void
and return the department head and custodian's signed cash handling policy
employee acknowledgment form.
      (2)   Upon completion of the cash audit and relinquishment of the funds
to the City Auditor or his/her designee, the cash will be deposited into the
municipal depository and appropriate accounting entries recorded to reverse the
recognition of the municipal cash funds on the general ledger.
   (G)   Security of cash funds.
      (1)   Funds must be secured in a safe when not being used operationally
or receipts are not being prepared for deposit.
      (2)   Provisions should be made in departments where more than one cash
fund exists to secure all funds that are not being currently utilized.
      (3)   Only the department head, cash fund custodian, and alternates
should maintain keys and have access to municipal cash funds on hand and
relinquished daily receipts when they are not in operational use or being
prepared for deposit.
      (4)   Bank bags must be locked and kept out of sight when transporting
municipal funds for deposit at the municipal depository.

§ 37.13 EXCEPTIONS TO CHAPTER.
   Except as provided in division (F)(3) of this section, the members of a
public body may hold an executive session only after a majority of a quorum of
the public body determines, by a roll call vote, to hold such a session and
only at a regular or special meeting for the sole purpose of the consideration
of any of the following matters:
   (A)   To consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion, or compensation of a public employee or official, or the
investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual unless the public employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual requests a public hearing. Except as
otherwise provided by law, no public body shall hold an executive session for
the discipline of an elected official for conduct related to the performance of
his or her official duties or for his or her removal from office. If a public
body holds an executive session pursuant to this division (A) the motion and
vote to hold that executive session shall state which one or more of the
approved purposes listed in this division (A) are the purposes for which the
executive session is to be held, but need not include the name of any person to
be considered at the meeting;

sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of information

personal, private interest is adverse to the general public interest.
      (1)   No member of a public body shall use this division (B) as a
subterfuge for providing covert information to prospective buyers or sellers. A
purchase or sale of public property is void if the seller or buyer of the
public property has received covert information from a member of a public body
that has not been disclosed to the general public in sufficient time for other
prospective buyers and sellers to prepare and submit offers.
      (2)   If the minutes of the public body show that all meetings and
deliberations of the public body have been conducted in compliance with this
section, any instrument executed by the public body purporting to convey,
lease, or otherwise dispose of any right, title, or interest in any public
property shall be conclusively presumed to have been executed in compliance
with this section insofar as the title or other interest of any bona fide
purchasers, lessees, or transferees of the property is concerned.
   (C)   Conferences with an attorney for the public body, concerning disputes
involving the public body that are the subject of pending or imminent court
action;
   (D)   Preparing for, conducting, or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment;
   (E)   Matters required to be kept confidential by federal law or regulations
or state statutes; and
   (F)   (1)   Details relative to the security arrangements and emergency
response protocols for a public body or a public office, if disclosure of the
matters discussed could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the security of
the public body or public office.
      (2)   In the case of a county hospital operated pursuant to R.C. Chapter
339, a joint township hospital operated pursuant to R.C. Chapter 513, or a
municipal hospital operated pursuant to R.C. Chapter 749, to consider trade
secrets, as defined in R.C. § 1333.61;
      (3)   To consider confidential information related to the marketing
plans, specific business strategy, production techniques, trade secrets, or
personal financial statements of an applicant for economic development
assistance, or to negotiations with other political subdivisions respecting
requests for economic development assistance, provided that both of the
following conditions apply:
         (a)   The information is directly related to a request for economic
development assistance that is to be provided or administered under any
provision of R.C. Chapter 715, 725, 1724, or 1728 or R.C. §§ 701.07, 3735.67 to
3735.70, 5709.40 to 5709.43, 5709.61 to 5709.69, 5709.73 to 5709.75, or 5709.77
to 5709.81, or that involves public infrastructure improvements or the
extension of utility services that are directly related to an economic
development project; and
         (b)   A unanimous quorum of the public body determines, by a roll call
vote, that the executive session is necessary to protect the interests of the
applicant or the possible investment or expenditure of public funds to be made
in connection with the economic development project.
      (4)   If a public body holds an executive session to consider any of the
matters listed in divisions (B) through (F), the motion and vote to hold that
executive session shall state which one or more of the approved matters listed
in those divisions are to be considered at the executive session.
      (5)   A public body specified in R.C. § 121.22(B)(1)(c) shall not hold an
executive session when meeting for the purposes specified in that division.
(R.C. § 121.22(G)) (1982 Code, § 36.13)
§ 37.14 PUBLIC OFFICIAL OR EMPLOYEE RESTRICTIONS.
   (A)   During the period of his or her employment or service and for two
years thereafter, no public official or employee shall disclose or use, without
proper authorization of public record, any information acquired by him or her
in the course of his or her official duties which has been clearly designated
to him or her as confidential.
   (B)   No person shall disclose or use for his or her personal profit any
information knowing it to be acquired from a public official or employee who is
in violation of division (A) of this section.
   (C)   This confidential designation must be warranted because of the status
of the proceedings or the circumstances under which the information was
received and preserving its confidentiality is necessary to the proper conduct
of government business, or where the confidential designation is provided by
law.

   (A)   Classifications of functions; nonliability; jurisdiction of the
courts.
      (1)   For the purposes of this chapter, the functions of political
subdivisions are classified as governmental functions and proprietary
functions. Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a political
subdivision is not liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or
loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission of the
political subdivision or an employee of the political subdivision in connection
with a governmental or proprietary function.
      (2)   The defenses and immunities conferred under this chapter and R.C.
Chapter 2744 apply in connection with all governmental and proprietary
functions performed by the political subdivision and its employees, whether
performed on behalf of the political subdivision or on behalf of another
political subdivision.
      (3)   Subject to statutory limitations upon their monetary jurisdiction,
the Courts of Common Pleas, the Municipal Courts, and the County Courts have
jurisdiction to hear and determine civil actions governed by or brought
pursuant to this chapter.
   (B)   Exceptions. Subject to §
38.03 and R.C. §§ 2744.03 and 2744.05, a political subdivision is liable in
damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or property
allegedly caused by an act or omission of the political subdivision or of any
of its employees in connection with a governmental or proprietary function, as
follows:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (B), political
subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused
by the negligent operation of any motor vehicle by their employees when the
employees are engaged within the scope of their employment and authority. The
following are full defenses to that liability:
         (a)   A member of a municipal corporation police department or any
other police agency was operating a motor vehicle while responding to an
emergency call and the operation of the vehicle did not constitute willful or
wanton misconduct;
         (b)   A member of a municipal corporation fire department or any other
firefighting agency was operating a motor vehicle while engaged in duty at a
fire, proceeding toward a place where a fire is in progress or is believed to
be in progress, or answering any other emergency alarm and the operation of the
vehicle did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct; and
         (c)   A member of an emergency medical service owned or operated by a
political subdivision was operating a motor vehicle while responding to or
completing a call for emergency medical care or treatment, the member was
holding a valid commercial driver’s license issued pursuant to R.C. Chapter
4506 or a driver’s license issued pursuant to Chapter 4507, the operation of
the vehicle did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct, and the operation
complies with the precautions of R.C. § 4511.03.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. §§ 3314.07 and 3746.24,
political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or
property caused by the negligent performance of acts by their employees with
respect to proprietary functions of the political subdivisions.
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 3746.24, political
subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused
by their negligent failure to keep public roads in repair and other negligent
failure to remove obstructions from public roads, except that it is a full
defense to such liability, when a bridge within a municipal corporation is
involved, that the municipal corporation does not have the responsibility for
maintaining or inspecting the bridge.
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 3746.24, political
subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property that
is caused by the negligence of their employees and that occurs within or on the
grounds of, and is due to physical defects within or on the grounds of,
buildings that are used in connection with the performance of a governmental
function, including, but not limited to, office buildings and courthouses, but
not including jails, places of juvenile detention, workhouses, or any other
detention facility, as defined in R.C. § 2921.01.
      (5)   In addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)
through (4) of this section, a political subdivision is liable for injury,
death, or loss to person or property when civil liability is expressly imposed
upon the political subdivision by a section of the Revised Code, including, but
not limited to, R.C. §§ 2743.02 and 5591.37. Civil liability shall not be
construed to exist under another section of the Revised Code merely because
that section imposes a responsibility or mandatory duty upon a political
subdivision, because that section provides for a criminal penalty, because of a
general authorization in that section that a political subdivision may sue and
be sued, or because that section uses the term “shall” in a provision
pertaining to a political subdivision.
   (C)   Final order. An order that denies a political subdivision or an
employee of a political subdivision the benefit of an alleged immunity from
liability as provided in R.C. Chapter 2744 or any other provision of the law is
a final order.
(R.C. § 2744.02) (1982 Code, § 37.02) (Res. 87-13, passed 6-1-1987)
§ 38.03 DEFENSES AND IMMUNITIES.
   (A)   In a civil action brought against a political subdivision or an
employee of a political subdivision to recover damages for injury, death, or
loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission in
connection with a governmental or proprietary function, the following defenses
or immunities may be asserted to establish nonliability:
      (1)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the employee
involved was engaged in the performance of a judicial, quasi-judicial,
prosecutorial, legislative, or quasi-legislative function;
      (2)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the conduct
of the employee involved, other than negligent conduct, that gave rise to the
claim of liability was required by law or authorized by law, or if the conduct
of the employee involved that gave rise to the claim of liability was necessary
or essential to the exercise of powers of the political subdivision or
employee;
      (3)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the action or
failure to act by the employee involved that gave rise to the claim of
liability was within the discretion of the employee with respect to policy-
making, planning, or enforcement powers by virtue of the duties and
responsibilities of the office or position of the employee;
      (4)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the action or
failure to act by the political subdivision or employee involved that gave rise
to the claim of liability, resulted in injury or death to a person who had been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to a criminal offense and who, at the time of
the injury or death, was serving any portion of the person’s sentence by
performing community service work for or in the political subdivision whether
pursuant to R.C. § 2951.02 or otherwise, or resulted in injury or death to a
child who was found to be a delinquent child and who, at the time of the injury
or death, was performing community service or community work for or in a
political subdivision in accordance with the order of a juvenile court entered
pursuant to R.C. §§ 2152.19 or 2152.20, and if, at the time of the person’s or
child’s injury or death, the person or child was covered for purposes of R.C.
Chapter 4123 in connection with the community service or community work for or
in the political subdivision;
      (5)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the injury,
death, or loss to person or property resulted from the exercise of judgment or
discretion in determining whether to acquire, or how to use, equipment,
supplies, materials, personnel, facilities, and other resources, unless the
judgment or discretion was exercised with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or
in a wanton or reckless manner;
      (6)   In addition to any immunity or defense referred to in division (A)
(7) of this section and in circumstances not covered by that division or R.C. §
3314.07 and 3746.24, the employee is immune from liability unless one of the
following applies:

scope of the employee’s employment or official responsibilities;
         (b)   The employee’s acts or omissions were with malicious purpose, in
bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner; or
         (c)   Civil liability is expressly imposed upon the employee by a
section of the Revised Code. Civil liability shall not be construed to exist
under another section of this code or the Ohio Revised Code merely because that
section imposes a responsibility or mandatory duty upon an employee, because of
a general authorization in that section that an employee may sue and be sued,
or because the section uses the term “shall” in a provision pertaining to an
employee.
      (7)   The political subdivision, and an employee who is the chief legal
officer of a political subdivision, an assistant of any such person, or a judge
of a court of this state, is entitled to any defense or immunity available at
common law or established by the Revised Code.
   (B)   Any immunity or defense conferred upon, or referred to in connection
with, an employee by division (A)(6) or (7) of this section does not affect or
limit any liability of a political subdivision for an act or omission of the
employee as provided in §
38.02.

Statutory reference:
   Damage awards, see R.C. § 2744.05
§ 38.06 PROVISION OF EMPLOYEES’ DEFENSE; CONSENT JUDGMENTS.
   (A)   Defense of actions against employees.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (A), a political
subdivision shall provide for the defense of an employee, in any state or
federal court, in any civil action or proceeding which contains an allegation
for damages for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by an act
or omission of the employee in connection with a governmental or proprietary
function. The political subdivision has the duty to defend the employee if the
act or omission occurred while the employee was acting in good faith and not
manifestly outside the scope of his or her employment or official
responsibilities. Amounts expended by a political subdivision in the defense of
its employees shall be from funds appropriated for this purpose or from
proceeds of insurance. The duty to provide for the defense of an employee
specified in this division (A) does not apply in a civil action or proceeding
that is commenced by or on behalf of a political subdivision.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (A), a political
subdivision shall indemnify and hold harmless an employee in the amount of any
judgment, other than a judgment for punitive or exemplary damages, that is
obtained against the employee in a state or federal court or as a result of a
law of a foreign jurisdiction and that is for damages for injury, death, or
loss to person or property caused by an act or omission in connection with a
governmental or proprietary function, if at the time of the act or omission the
employee was acting in good faith and within the scope of his or her employment
or official responsibilities.
   (B)   Consent judgments.
      (1)   A political subdivision may enter into a consent judgment or
settlement and may secure releases from liability for itself or an employee,
with respect to any claim for injury, death, or loss to person or property
caused by an act or omission in connection with a governmental or proprietary
function.
      (2)   No action or appeal of any kind shall be brought by any person,
including any employee or a taxpayer, with respect to the decision of a
political subdivision pursuant to division (B)(1) of this section whether to
enter into a consent judgment or settlement or to secure releases, or
concerning the amount and circumstances of a consent judgment or settlement.
Amounts expended for any settlement shall be from funds appropriated for this
purpose.
   (C)   Failure to provide defense. If a political subdivision refuses to
provide an employee with a defense in a civil action or proceeding as described
in division (A)(1) of this section, upon the motion of the political
subdivision, the court shall conduct a hearing regarding the political
subdivision’s duty to defend the employee in that civil action. The political
subdivision shall file the motion within 30 days of the close of discovery in
the action. After the motion is filed, the employee shall have not less than 30
days to respond to the motion. At the request of the political subdivision or
the employee, the court shall order the motion to be heard at an oral hearing.
At the hearing on the motion, the court shall consider all evidence and
arguments submitted by the parties. In determining whether a political
subdivision has a duty to defend the employee in the action, the court shall
determine whether the employee was acting both in good faith and not manifestly
outside the scope of employment or official responsibilities. The pleadings
shall not be determinative of whether the employee acted in good faith or was
manifestly outside the scope of employment or official responsibilities. If the
court determines that the employee was acting both in good faith and not
manifestly outside the scope of employment or official responsibilities, the
court shall order the political subdivision to defend the employee in the
action.
(R.C. § 2744.07) (1982 Code, § 37.06) (Res. 87-13, passed 6-1-1987)
§ 38.07 LIABILITY INSURANCE.
   (A)   (1)   A political subdivision may use public funds to secure insurance
with respect to its and its employees’ potential liability in damages in civil
actions for injury, death, or loss to persons or property allegedly caused by
an act or omission of the political subdivision or any of its employees in
connection with a governmental or proprietary function. The insurance may be at
the limits, for the circumstances, and subject to the terms and conditions,
that are determined by the political subdivision in its discretion. The
insurance may be for the period of time that is set forth in specifications for
competitive bids or, when competitive bidding is not required, for the period
of time that is mutually agreed upon by the political subdivision and insurance
company. The period of time does not have to be, but can be, limited to the
fiscal cycle under which the political subdivision is funded and operated.
      (2)   (a)   Regardless of whether a political subdivision procures a
policy or policies of liability insurance pursuant to this division (A) of this
section or otherwise, the political subdivision may establish and maintain a
self-insurance program relative to its and its employees’ potential liability
in damages in civil actions for injury, death, or loss to persons or property
allegedly caused by an act or omission of the political subdivision or any of
its employees in connection with a governmental or proprietary function. The
political subdivision may reserve such funds as it deems appropriate in a
special fund that may be established pursuant to an ordinance or resolution of
the political subdivision and not subject to R.C. § 5705.12. The political
subdivision may allocate the costs of insurance of a self-insurance program, or
both, among the funds or accounts in the subdivision’s treasury on the basis of
relative exposure and loss experience. The political subdivision may require
any deductibles under an insurance or self-insurance program, or both, to be
paid from funds or accounts in the subdivision’s treasury from which a loss was
directly attributable. If it so chooses, the political subdivision may contract
with any person, other political subdivision, or regional council of
governments for purposes of the administration of such program.
         (b)   Political subdivisions that have established self-insurance
programs relative to their and their employees’ potential liability as
described in division (A)(2)(a) of this section may mutually agree that their
self-insurance programs will be jointly administered in a specific manner.
   (B)   The purchase of liability insurance, or the establishment and
maintenance of a self-insurance program, by a political subdivision does not
constitute a waiver of any immunity or defense of the political subdivision or
its employees, except that the political subdivision may specifically waive any
immunity or defense to which it or its employees may be entitled if a provision
to that effect is specifically included in the policy of insurance or in a
written plan of operation of the self-insurance program, or, if any, the
legislative enactment of the political subdivision authorizing the purchase of
the insurance or the establishment and maintenance of the self-insurance
program. Such a specific waiver shall be only to the extent of the insurance or
self-insurance program coverage.
   (C)   The authorizations for political subdivisions to secure insurance and
to establish and maintain self-insurance programs in this section are in
addition to any other authority to secure insurance or to establish and
maintain self-insurance programs that is granted pursuant to the Revised Code
or the Ohio Constitution, and they are not in derogation of any other
authorization.
(R.C. § 2744.08)
   (D)   If a political subdivision, pursuant to division (A)(2)(a) of this
section or a joint self-insurance pool pursuant to R.C. § 2744.081, has
allocated costs to, or required the payment of deductibles from, funds or
accounts in the subdivision’s treasury, the subdivisions’s fiscal officer,
pursuant to ordinance or resolution of the legislative authority, shall
transfer amounts equal to those costs or deductibles from the funds or accounts
of the subdivision’s General Fund if both of the following occur:
      (1)   The subdivision requests payment from the employee responsible for
the funds or accounts for those costs or deductibles; and
      (2)   The employee receiving the request fails to remit payment within 45
days after the date of receipt of the request.
   (E)   The provisions of R.C. §§ 5705.14, 5705.15, and 5705.16 do not apply
to transfers made pursuant to division (D) of this section.

subdivision or any of its employees for contractual liability;
   (B)   Civil actions by an employee, or the collective bargaining

      (2)   Describe the physical security of data when it is printed on paper;
      (3)   Describe the electronic security of data when stored and
distributed; and
      (4)   Place the municipality in compliance with state and federal law
regarding identity theft protection.
   (C)   This policy enables the municipality to protect existing customers,
reducing risk from identity fraud, and minimize potential damage to the
municipality from fraudulent new accounts. The program will help the
municipality:
      (1)   Identify risks that signify potentially fraudulent activity within
new or existing covered accounts;
      (2)   Detect risks when they occur in covered accounts;
      (3)   Respond to risks to determine if fraudulent activity has occurred
and act if fraud has been attempted or committed; and

others is strictly prohibited.”
(1982 Code, § 38.04) (Res. 08-46, passed 2-9-2009)
§ 39.05 ADDITIONAL IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM.
   If the municipality maintains certain covered accounts pursuant to federal
legislation, the municipality may include the additional program details.
   (A)   Covered accounts. A covered account includes any account that involves
or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions. Every new and
existing customer account that meets the following criteria is covered by this
program:
      (1)   Business, personal, and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft; or
      (2)   Business, personal, and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk to the safety or soundness of the municipality from
identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation, or
litigation risks.
   (B)   Red flags.
      (1)   Potential indicators of fraud. The following red flags are
potential indicators of fraud. Any time a red flag, or a situation closely
resembling a red flag, is apparent, it should be investigated for verification.
         (a)   Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer reporting
agency;
         (b)   A fraud or active duty alert included with a consumer report;
         (c)   A notice of credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency in
response to a request for a consumer report; or
         (d)   A notice of address discrepancy from a consumer reporting agency
as defined in § 334.82(b) of the Fairness and Accuracy in Credit Transactions
Act, being 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681c(h)(1).
      (2)   Consumer reports included. Red flags also include consumer reports
that indicate a pattern of activity inconsistent with the history and usual
pattern of activity of an applicant or customer, such as:
         (a)   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
         (b)   An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;
         (c)   A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect
to recently established credit relationships; or
         (d)   An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of
account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
      (3)   Suspicious documents.
         (a)   Documents provided for identification that appear to have been
altered or forged;
         (b)   The photograph or physical description on the identification is
not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification;
         (c)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification;
         (d)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the municipality, such as a
signature card or a recent check; and
         (e)   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives
the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
      (4)   Suspicious personal identifying information.
         (a)   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the municipality. For
example:
            1.   The address does not match any address in the consumer report;
            2.   The Social Security number (SSN) has not been issued or is
listed on the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File; or
            3.   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is
not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and
date of birth.
         (b)   Personal identifying information provided is associated with
known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used
by the municipality. For example, the address on an application is the same as
the address provided on a fraudulent application;
         (c)   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the municipality. For example:
            1.   The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a
prison; or
            2.   The phone number is invalid or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
         (d)   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons
opening an account or other customers;
         (e)   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or
similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large
number of other customers or other persons opening accounts;
         (f)   The customer or the person opening the covered account fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete;
         (g)   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the municipality; and
         (h)   When using security questions (mother’s maiden name, pet’s name,
and the like), the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot
provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be
available from a wallet or consumer report.
      (5)   Unusual use of, or suspicious activity related to, the covered
account.
         (a)   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a
covered account, the municipality receives a request for new, additional, or
replacement goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the
account.
         (b)   A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly
associated with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example, the customer
fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent
payments.
         (c)   A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent
with established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:
            1.   Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed
payments; and
            2.   A material change in purchasing or usage patterns.
         (d)   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably
lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account,
the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
         (e)   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as
undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with
the customer’s covered account.
         (f)   The municipality is notified that the customer is not receiving
paper account statements.
         (g)   The municipality is notified of unauthorized charges or
transactions in connection with a customer’s covered account.
         (h)   The municipality receives notice from customers, victims of
identity theft, law enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding
possible identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the
municipality.
         (i)   The municipality is notified by a customer, a victim of identity
theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a
fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.
(1982 Code, § 38.05) (Res. 08-46, passed 2-9-2009)
§ 39.06 RESPONDING TO RED FLAGS.
   (A)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, an employee must act
quickly as a rapid appropriate response can protect customers and the
municipality from damages and loss.
      (1)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, gather all
related documentation and write a description of the situation. Present this
information to the designated authority for determination.
      (2)   The designated authority will complete additional authentication to
determine whether the attempted transaction was fraudulent or authentic.
   (B)   If a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate actions
must be taken immediately. Actions may include:
      (1)   Canceling the transaction;
      (2)   Notifying and cooperating with appropriate law enforcement;
      (3)   Determining the extent of liability of the municipality; and
      (4)   Notifying the actual customer that fraud has been attempted.
(1982 Code, § 38.06) (Res. 08-46, passed 2-9-2009)
§ 39.07 PERIODIC UPDATES TO PLAN.
   (A)   At periodic intervals established in the program, or as required, the
program will be re-evaluated to determine whether all aspects of the program
are up to date and applicable in the current business environment.
   (B)   Periodic reviews will include an assessment of which accounts are
covered by the program.
   (C)   As part of the review, red flags may be revised, replaced, or
eliminated. Defining new red flags may also be appropriate.
   (D)   Actions to take in the event that fraudulent activity is discovered
may also require revision to reduce damage to the municipality and its
customers.
(1982 Code, § 38.07) (Res. 08-46, passed 2-9-2009)
§ 39.08 PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Involvement of management.
      (1)   The identity theft prevention program shall not be operated as an
extension to existing fraud prevention programs, and its importance warrants
the highest level of attention.
      (2)   The identity theft prevention program is the responsibility of the
governing body. Approval of the initial plan must be appropriately documented
and maintained.
      (3)   Operational responsibility of the program is delegated to the
Safety Service Director.
   (B)   Staff training.
      (1)   Staff training shall be conducted for all employees, officials, and
contractors for whom it is reasonably foreseeable that they may come into
contact with accounts or personally identifiable information that may
constitute a risk to the municipality or its customers.
      (2)   The Safety Service Director is responsible for ensuring identity
theft training for all requisite employees and contractors.
      (3)   Employees must receive annual training in all elements of this
policy.
      (4)   To ensure maximum effectiveness, employees may continue to receive
additional training as changes to the program are made.
   (C)   Oversight of service provider arrangements.
      (1)   It is the responsibility of the municipality to ensure that the
activities of all service providers are conducted in accordance with reasonable
policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of
identity theft.
      (2)   A service provider that maintains its own identity theft prevention
program, consistent with the guidance of the red flag rules and validated by
appropriate due diligence, may be considered to be meeting these requirements.
      (3)   Any specific requirements should be specifically addressed in the
appropriate contract arrangements.
(1982 Code, § 38.08) (Res. 08-46, passed 2-9-2009)
PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY
§ 39.20 PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose and scope. The City of Hillsboro recognizes its obligations as
set forth in R.C. Chapter 149 regarding public records. Should changes to the
law occur that conflict with the provisions of this policy, the law will
supersede this policy. It is the policy of the City of Hillsboro that, as
required by Ohio law, records will be organized and maintained so that they are
readily available for inspection and copying.
   (B)   Definitions.
      ACTUAL COST and COMMERCIAL have the same meanings as in R.C. § 149.43.
      PUBLIC RECORD. A record that is kept by the city that contains
information stored in a fixed medium, such as paper, film, electronic mail,
etc., that is created, received or sent under the jurisdiction of the city that
documents the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures,
operations or other activities of the office. Information contained within a
record may be exempt from disclosure under state or federal law or because of
privilege or confidentiality requirements. Attorney-work product is also not
public record.
      REDACTION. Obscuring or deleting any information that is exempt from the
duty to permit public inspection or copying from an item that otherwise meets
the definition of a record in R.C. § 149.011.
      REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS. 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday,
excluding city holidays.
      REQUESTER. A person, group, or entity making a public record request.
   (C)   Records Custodian.
      (1)   The city will appoint an employee to serve as Records Custodian.
The Records Custodian has custody of the records for the city. The Records
Custodian must acknowledge receipt of a copy of this Policy and is responsible
for posting this Policy and the city's Public Records poster in a conspicuous
place in each location where the city does business.
      (2)   The Records Custodian is responsible for contacting the Law
Department for legal review of records requests. The Records Custodian is
responsible for recording the receipt of the request and for delivering the
request once the records are retrieved by the appropriate department. The
Records Custodian is also responsible for reviewing and updating record
retention schedules and ensuring that the department or division's retention
schedule is available to the public for review.
      (3)   Each department or division is also responsible for publishing a
copy of this Policy in any manuals or handbooks of general policies and
procedures that the department or division puts together for employees.
   (D)   Procedures for record requests.
      (1)   Public records may be accessed by one of the following methods:
         (a)   A request to view public records in person;
         (b)   A request for copies which the requester will personally pick
up; or
         (c)   A request for copies of public records that the requester would
like mailed or otherwise delivered to the requester.
      (2)   The city will only respond to public record requests during regular
business hours and not on city holidays. Upon request, except as otherwise
provided by law, the city shall provide all public records responsive to a
request promptly for inspection. If a public record contains information that
is exempt from the duty to permit public inspection or copying, the city shall
make available all of the information within the public record that is not
exempt. If copies of the public records are requested, the copies will be made
within a reasonable time, as required by the Ohio Revised Code. The time for
compliance will depend upon the availability of the public records (i.e., the
proximity of where the records are stored) and the volume of public records
requested. Time will also be allowed for legal review.
      (3)   Although no specific language is necessary to make a request, the
requester must at a minimum identify the records requested with sufficient
clarity to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the
records. If it is not clear what records are being requested, the records
custodian must contact the requester for clarification, and should assist the
requester in revising the request by informing the requester of the manner in
which the office keeps its records.
      (4)   A public records request does not need to be in writing or identify
the person making the request. If the request is verbal, the city employee
receiving the request will write down the complete request and confirm the
wording with the requester to assure accuracy. The requestor need not specify
the reason for the request nor use particular wording to make a request.
      (5)   The requester may choose to have copies of the public record(s)
made on paper, upon the same medium upon which the city keeps it, or upon any
medium upon which the city determines that it can reasonably be duplicated as
an integral part of the normal operations of the city.
      (6)   Public records will only be copied by authorized employees. The
city may use an outside copying service to make the copies. Under no
circumstances will the requester be permitted to make copies himself or
herself.
      (7)   Record retention schedules are to be updated regularly and will be
available to the public upon request.
   (E)   Electronic mail. Documents in electronic format may be public records
if they meet the definition of a public record contained in the Ohio Revised
Code. Electronic mail is to be treated the same as other records and should
follow the same retention schedules. Records in private e-mail accounts that
are used to conduct public business are subject to disclosure, and all city
employees are to retain their e-mails that relate to public business and to
copy them to their business e-mail accounts and/or to the office's records
custodian.
   (F)   Payment.
      (1)   Those seeking public records shall be charged only the actual cost
of making copies and reimbursement for the means in which the records were
delivered (i.e., postage or jump drives for electronic copies).
      (2)   Upon request by the city, the requester shall pay in advance the
cost of copying the public record(s). Payment shall be in cash or by check. The
city will furnish a receipt for payments received.
      (3)   The charge for paper (standard sized or legal) is $0.15 per page.
Each division or department is responsible for determining the actual cost for
downloading computer files, copying photographs or maps, cassette tapes and any
other media. The Police Department shall charge the cost of processing public
records requests for video footage at a rate of $75 for each 15-minute segment
of footage not to exceed $750 per requested video. All records requests
pertaining to Police Department video footage shall be paid for prior to the
release of the record once an estimated cost is determined for redaction.
      (4)   The city shall review their actual cost regularly and update this
section as needed.
      (5)   Requesters may ask that copies of public records be mailed to them.
The city shall require payment in advance for the actual cost of postage or the
cost of delivery and for the actual cost of supplies used in the mailing,
delivery or transmission of public records if the requester has requested the
public records to be mailed, delivered or transmitted to him/her.
      (6)   If the city uses an outside copying service to make the copies, the
requester will be required to pay the cost of the entire copying job, as billed
by the copying service.
   (G)   Denial of a public record request.
      (1)   Under certain circumstances, records are not defined as public
records under Ohio law. In these situations, the public record request will be
denied on that basis. Ohio law also recognizes certain actions as denials of
public record requests.
      (2)   A document that otherwise meets the definition of a public record
may contain information that is not within the definition of a public record.
In that case, the city will redact the portion of the public record that does
not meet the definition of a public record. If a public record contains
information that is exempt from the duty to permit public inspection and
copying, the city shall make available all information within the public record
which is not exempt. When making the public record available for public
inspection or copying, the city shall notify the requester of any redaction or
make the redaction plainly visible. A redaction shall be deemed a denial of a
request to inspect or copy the redacted information, except if federal or state
law authorizes or requires a public office to make the redaction.
      (3)   In the event that a request for public records is made from which
the city cannot determine what public records the requester is seeking, the
city will inform the requester that the public records request is denied but
will provide the requester with an opportunity to more accurately describe the
public records being requested. If the requester is seeking public records
organized in certain way but the public records are not organized that way, the
city will inform the requester of the manner in which the public records are
maintained and accessed. The requester may then submit another public records
request that more accurately reflects the organization of the public records
and the actual public records sought by the requester.
      (4)   The city reserves the right to withhold documents that are subject
to recognized privileges and confidentiality requirements or are otherwise
exempt from request for review by law.
      (5)   Ohio law requires that any denial including any redactions and the
reason therefor, except those which are required by state or federal law, be
supported by legal authority. All denials will be in writing whether or not the
request was in writing or a verbal request.
(1982 Code, § 38.20) (Res. 12-38, passed 11-13-2012; Ord. 2023-13, passed 5-11-
2023; Ord. 2025-03, passed 4-16-2025)
POLICY FOR DISPOSITION OF HUMAN REMAINS
§ 39.35 POLICY FOR DISPOSITION OF HUMAN REMAINS.
   The city, without surrendering its defenses and objections to providing
funding for the disposition for human remains, does hereby establish this
policy for compliance with R.C. § 9.15.
   (A)   As used in this section, LEGAL RESIDENCE means a permanent place of
abode used or occupied as living quarters at the time of a person's death,
including a nursing home, hospital, or other care facility.
   (B)   When the body of a dead person is found in the City of Hillsboro, and
such person was not an inmate of a correctional, benevolent, or charitable
institution of this state, and the body is not claimed by any person for
private interment or cremation at the person's own expense, or delivered for
the purpose of medical or surgical study or dissection in accordance with R.C.
§ 1713.34, it shall be disposed of as follows:
      (1)   If the person was a legal resident of the county, the proper
officers of the municipal corporation in which the person's body was found
shall cause it to be buried or cremated at the expense of the municipal
corporation in which the person had a legal residence at the time of death.
      (2)   If the person had a legal residence in any other county of the
state at the time of death, the superintendent of the county home of the county
in which such body was found shall cause it to be buried or cremated at the
expense of the township or municipal corporation in which the person had a
legal residence at the time of death.
      (3)   Such officials shall provide, at the grave of the person or, if the
person's cremated remains are buried, at the grave of the person's cremated
remains, a metal, stone, or concrete marker on which the person's name and age,
if known, and date of death shall be inscribed.
   (C)   The City Auditor, upon information supplied upon a form devised by the
Auditor's office for that purpose that an indigent resident of the county was
found deceased within the corporation limits of the city, shall immediately
inquire of the funeral homes in the southwest Ohio area as to the cost and
availability of services to make disposition of human remains; and shall
provide up to $750 toward the entire cost of the disposition, determining the
lowest responsive, responsible proposal, as in the Auditor's opinion best
serves the needs of the city.
   (D)   Any costs advanced by the city for the disposition of the human
remains shall be certified to the Law Director for collection, who is
authorized and directed to sue any person legally responsible for the costs,
begin probate proceedings as a creditor to determine the assets of the decedent
available to pay the costs, and collect the estate assets and reimburse the
city for costs and legal fees as authorized by the probate court.
   (E)   (1)   The Auditor may summon witnesses and administer oaths in order
to determine the indigent status of a decedent, the actual costs necessary for
the disposition of human remains, and the location where the decedent was found
and decedent's residence.
      (2)   Witness fees and court reporter costs shall be paid from the city
treasury in addition to the disposition costs.
   (F)   Any payment made under this policy is subject to recovery in the event
it appears the deceased person was not entitled to have disposition made at the
expense of the city if discovered at any time within two years of payment; and
the city retains a lien for that period of time upon the property and accounts
of the payee for that period of time to collect any judgment for recovery of
payments.

FIXED ASSET POLICY
§ 39.80 FIXED ASSET POLICY.
   (A)   Adoption. Inasmuch as the Auditor of State has declared, by
Administrative Rule No. 117-1-11 that each city in the State of Ohio shall
prepare an annual financial report in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board

conformity with GAAP, the City of Hillsboro shall adopt and maintain a capital
asset accounting system reporting monetary amounts associated with capital
asset transactions and a capital asset management system which addresses the
acquisition, use, inventory control, protection, maintenance and disposal of
assets.
   (B)   Definition of capital assets.
      (1)   Capital assets (C/A) are defined as those assets of a long term
character which are intended to continue to be held or used, such as land,
buildings, land improvements, building service equipment, fixed equipment,
movable equipment, minor equipment, vehicles, water and sewer lines, and
construction in progress. They are (1) tangible in nature, (2) have an extended
useful life, (3) are not a repair part or supply item, and (4) have a value
greater than the "capitalization threshold".
      (2)   The capitalization threshold is a dollar limit, $5000, used to
create a category of assets that meet the first three criteria noted in the
preceding division, but are not classified as capital assets because their
original costs do not meet or exceed the threshold limit. These assets do not
appear in the C/A list. However, due to their nature, control of these assets
may be desirable. These "controlled" or "critical nature" assets would include
assets that are sensitive, portable or prone to theft. During the C/A inventory
"controlled" assets must be identified and recorded, but since they will not be
reported as C/A on the financial report, their cost figures need not be
identified or calculated.
   (C)   Purpose. Before a capital asset system can be established, the uses of
the system's information must be identified. The City of Hillsboro capital
asset system shall maintain sufficient information to permit the following:
      (1)   Financial statement information in conformity with GAAP;
      (2)   Insurable values that may prevent the city from being over or under
insured, and insure full recovery in the event of loss;
      (3)   Control and accountability of assets attained through physical
inventories noting location and responsible parties;
      (4)   Maintenance scheduling and cost analysis providing repair/replace
information; may instill preventative maintenance as opposed to emergency
maintenance;
      (5)   Excess asset management can prevent unnecessary purchases;
      (6)   Accounting for depreciation provides "must" information for report
purposes;
      (7)   Debt security allows enterprise fund assets to be used as security
for debt issued to construct or improve assets of that enterprise fund;
      (8)   Preparation of capital and operating budgets is easier with C/
A information regarding asset condition; and
      (9)   Debt management identifies both long and short-term financing needs
and aids in the preparation to meet those needs.
   (D)   Policy. In order to establish and maintain the C/A purposes as
outlined, decisions on the major capital asset issues must also be documented
and become a part of the city's capital asset policy.
      (1)   Capital assets (C/A) shall be divided into two distinct groups,
fund capital assets (F.C/A) and governmental activities capital assets (GACA).
Capital assets related to specific proprietary trust funds (water, sewer and
stormwater) are C/A and should be accounted for in their specific fund. All
other capital assets should be accounted for through the GACA.
      (2)   With regard to "Guidelines for the Capitalizing of Capital Assets",
see the following:
         (a)   Asset type. Capital assets shall be classified as follows:
            1.   Land;
            2.   Land improvements;
            3.   Buildings;
            4.   Building improvements;
            5.   Building service equipment;
            6.   Utility plant in service;
            7.   Fixed equipment;
            8.   Movable equipment;
            9.   Minor equipment;
            10.   Vehicles;
            11.   Water and sewer lines;
            12.   Construction-in-progress; and
            13.   Equipment and machinery on capital lease.
         (b)   Capital assets shall be recorded at historical cost or, if that
amount is not practicably determinable, at estimated historical cost. Donated
capital assets shall be valued at their acquisition (fair) value when received.
         (c)   Assets with a total cost of less than $5000 will not be
accounted for as financial statement capital assets.
         (d)   Assets not treated as financial statement capital assets, but
whose control is desirable, will be maintained as controlled assets.
         (e)   Infrastructure capital assets include roads, bridges, curbs,
gutters, streets, sidewalks, and the like will be recorded.
         (f)   Items "under construction" will be capitalized as capital assets
when construction begins.
         (g)   Additions to C/A that extend the useful life of the asset will
be capitalized, as opposed to a small repair or routine maintenance that will
be expensed. Additions include but are not limited to, complete overhaul or
reconditioning which return the capital assets to new or better condition, or
additions or accessories that extend the life of the capital assets beyond its
depreciated life. Each overhaul, reconditioning, addition, accessory, and the
like must cost $5000 for capitalization to take effect and all will be handled
on an individual basis.
         (h)   Transfers of capital assets from one department/office to
another shall be coordinated through the Auditor and Safety and Service
Director to ensure the accuracy of inventory records. A disposal/transfer
notice form is to be completed for each transfer or disposal.
         (i)   Leases for assets for which the city receives the benefits and
risks of ownership will be evaluated using the criteria discussed in
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 87 to determine
whether they should be recorded as assets by the city.
         (j)   All capital assets of Hillsboro will be tagged for
accountability and control, where it is practicable to do so. The capital asset
manager and the capital asset representative (see division (k) below) shall
work together to ensure the tagging of all capital assets.
         (k)   Each organizational unit (office or department) shall be
responsible for the capital assets within its limit. In carrying out that
responsibility, it is suggested that each unit designate a capital asset
representative who will coordinate capital asset purchases, transfers,
disposals, and the like with the City Auditor. The ultimate responsibility for
a capital asset's location, condition and/or safekeeping lies with the office
holder or department head.
         (l)   For assets to qualify as capital assets, the following ancillary
charges will be included in the determination:
            1.   Freight and transportation charges;
            2.   Closing costs;
            3.   Fees: legal, title, appraisal, surveying, architect,
accounting, consulting, and negotiation;
            4.   Land preparation and demolition costs;
            5.   Insurance premiums and interest costs during construction; and
            6.   Training and/or consultation fees.
         (m)   Salvage value of fund capital assets will be determined by the
user and communicated to the Finance Department to make the necessary
adjustments.
         (n)   Accumulated depreciation will be calculated by the "straight-
line" method and used as a reduction of the capital asset value, i.e. cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation on motor vehicles will be maintained for
insurance purposes. Capital assets purchased within a fiscal year will be
depreciated for a full year.
         (o)   Maintenance agreement costs will be expensed; however, they will
be included in financial statement noted.
         (p)   Insurable cost-donated items other than cash will be "booked" at
fair market value at the time of donation and handled according to items of a
similar nature on the balance sheet.
         (q)   The city's portion of jointly owned property will be accounted
for and duly noted on the financial statements.
         (r)   Assets that came into the possession of the city through
foreclosure proceedings
are to be accounted for as capital assets if ownership is to be retained by the
city.
   (E)   Procedures.
      (1)   Capital asset manager.
         (a)   The accuracy of the capital asset accounting and management
systems is of paramount importance to ensure the correctness of the city's
financial reporting; therefore, to ensure the development and maintenance of
the capital asset accounting and management systems, Hillsboro will, through
the Auditor's office, appoint a capital asset manager who will coordinate the
flow of information and data within the system.
         (b)   Additionally, to ensure the correctness of inventory
information, individuals in each office and/or department (C/A representatives)
shall be assigned capital asset responsibilities and designated to work with
the manager. It is important that this person be notified of purchases,
transfers or disposals made within the office or department.
      (2)   Purchase orders.
         (a)   A purchase requisition shall be completed and submitted to the
purchasing agent for approval. Once the requisition is approved, the Auditor
will certify if funds are available and will issue a purchase order. Following
certification, two copies of the purchase order are retained by the Auditor's
office for use by the C/A manager and the Accounts Payable clerk.
         (b)   Upon request for payment of the item invoice, the department
head/office will forward to the C/A manager a copy of the invoice and purchase
order for entry into the C/A system. The manager will forward an identification
tag(s) to the responsible person in the department/office for placement onto
the asset.
      (3)   Capital asset disposal.
         (a)   All notices of asset disposal or transfer are to be submitted to
the capital asset manager for review and updating of asset inventory records.
The C/A manager is to keep the original request and forward a copy and any
attached copies to the originating person. Ideally, the notice should flow
through the C/A representative in the office/department to and from the capital
asset manager.
         (b)   After disposal/transfer acknowledgment has been received by the
originator, a copy that has been signed by the originator shall be sent to the
fiscal officer and, in the case of transfer, a copy to the office receiving the
asset. Transfers for auction purposes should be treated the same except that
the asset will be transferred to a central location for storage and control
purposes.
         (c)   On a reasonable basis, a list of "assets held for sale" will be
prepared by the Auditor and a copy forwarded to the Safety and Service
Director, who will compare the list to the list of assets approved for
disposal. A second copy of the list is to be sent to the head of the storage
location for verification. Any discrepancies are to be reported to the C/
A manager.
         (d)   After the auction, the C/A manager will prepare a list of assets
sold and the amount of money received for each and shall provide a copy to the
fiscal officer. All asset lists should then be updated.
      (4)   Annual capital asset review.
         (a)   Annually, the Auditor shall prepare a master list of all City of
Hillsboro assets, a report of assets purchased (acquisition report) and a
report of assets disposed of or transferred (retirement report). These reports
are also to be prepared by each department/office so that a copy of each report
can be sent to each department/office for verification.
         (b)   Any exception to the reports is to be reported to the capital
asset manager for resolution and adjustment to the inventory.
      (5)   Capital assets not-in-use. On a regular basis, the department heads
will report to the Auditor all assets not-in-use. The Auditor shall prepare
quarterly a report listing all assets not-in-use for distribution to all
departments. Offices, upon review, may request transfer of any needed items.
The Safety and Service Director will also review the report to identify assets
that can be transferred in response to a requisition to purchase and assets
that can be sold. Transfer in response to requisition to purchase is not
mandatory; however, consideration of this alternative is economically feasible
to the city.
      (6)   Altered status. Other than the aforementioned disposal, transfer or
retirement of capital assets, any other alteration of a capital asset's status,
loss, theft, damage or repair shall be immediately be reported to the capital
asset manager. The capital asset manager will investigate the matter and
determine the proper course of action for inventory and accounting purposes.
      (7)   Physical inventory. The Auditor will direct the various department
heads to perform periodic physical inventories to ensure the accuracy of
inventory records of the City of Hillsboro and to comply with the rules of the
Auditor of State. Inventory guidelines will be adopted by the auditor with the
approval of the Hillsboro City Council and become a part of these procedures.

(Ord. 2018-07, passed 9-10-2018)
§ 40.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide a civil remedy for damages to
persons in this community injured by an individual’s use of illegal controlled
substances. It establishes a cause of action against drug dealers for damages
for monetary, noneconomic, and physical losses incurred as a result of an
individual’s use of an illegal controlled substance. This chapter will shift
the cost of the damage caused by the marketing of illegal drugs to those who
illegally profit from that market, as well as deter others from entering the
illegal drug market by subjecting them to substantial monetary loss. This
chapter will also provide an incentive for individual users to identify illegal
drug marketers and recover from them the costs of their own drug treatment.

§ 50.060 PRETREATMENT.
   (A)   When it is deemed necessary by the Safety and Service Director, or his
or her designated representative, that industrial wastes may need to be
pretreated prior to the wastes being introduced into the city sewer system, the
industry or person proposing to introduce the wastes into the city sewer system
shall furnish to the Safety and Service Director such data and information as
the Safety and Service Director may require to determine the nature, character,
and content of the wastes, or the industry or person shall cooperate with the
Safety and Service Director in the collection of such data and information.
   (B)   If, based on the data and information so furnished to or collected by
the Safety and Service Director or his or her designated representative, it is
determined that pretreatment is required before industrial wastes may be
introduced into the city sewer system, the industry or person shall furnish to
the Safety and Service Director a proposal of the means by which the industrial
wastes shall be pretreated to make them acceptable for introduction into the
city sewer system. Upon approval by the Safety and Service Director of the
proposed means of pretreatment, the industry or person shall prepare or cause
to be prepared by an engineer registered by the state plans and specifications
for facilities for pretreatment of the industrial wastes in conformance with
and to effectuate the approved proposed means of pretreatment of the industrial
wastes. The plans and specifications shall be submitted to the Safety and
Service Director or his or her designated representative for review prior to
the issuance of a permit by the city for the construction of the industrial
waste pretreatment facilities. The Safety and Service Director may charge a fee
not to exceed $250 to cover the reasonable expenses to the city in reviewing
the plans and specifications and to observe the pretreatment facilities during
their construction to determine conformance of actual construction performed to
the plans and specifications approved by the Safety and Service Director.
Issuance of a construction permit or acceptance of a proposed method of
pretreatment of industrial wastes by the city or the Safety and Service
Director shall not commit the city to the final acceptance of the industrial
wastes pretreatment facilities or the industrial wastes proposed to be
introduced into the city sewer system and shall be deemed only as
acknowledgment by the city that the industry or the person is, in good faith,
attempting to pretreat the industrial wastes to make them acceptable for
introduction into the city sewer system.
   (C)   No construction of such pretreatment facilities shall commence until a
construction permit therefor has been issued by the Safety and Service
Director.

Safety and Service Director on proper application of the industry or person
proposing to introduce the industrial wastes into the city sewer system. The
industrial waste permit may be terminated at anytime by the Safety and Service
Director upon determination that the industrial wastes contain toxic or harmful
substances in excess of limits established by §
50.056.
   (B)   As an additional condition to obtaining a permit to introduce
industrial wastes into the city sewer system, each applicant for an industrial
waste disposal permit must agree that the City Safety and Service Director may
cause the permit holder’s means of introducing the industrial wastes into the
city sewer system to be blocked, closed, disconnected, or otherwise terminated
from the city sewer system at the permit holder’s cost and expense on a finding
by the Safety and Service Director that the industrial wastes exceed the
permitted limit of any toxic or harmful substance as provided in §
50.062, or in any state or federal statute or regulation. Any reconnection
costs and expenses shall also be borne by the permit holder. The permit holder
shall pay a reconnection fee of $250, any part or all of which may be waived by

be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and accessible at all
times.
   (D)   The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrial user’s premises outside of the building. When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the city may allow such a
facility to be constructed in the public right-of-way, and located so that it
will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping, or parked vehicles.
   (E)   When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the city
may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each user. When
there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operation of a single user, the city may
require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each discharge.
   (F)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the city requirements and
all applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (G)   Compliance determinations with respect to the prohibitions and
limitations stated in §§
50.056 and
50.057 may be made on the basis of either instantaneous grab samples or
composite samples of wastewater. Composite samples may be taken over a 24-hour
period, or over a longer or shorter time span, as determined necessary by the
city in order to meet the needs of specific circumstances.
   (H)   Laboratory analysis of industrial wastewater samples shall be
performed in accordance with the current edition of Standard Methods, Methods
for Chemical Analysis of Water and Waste, published by the USEPA, or the Annual
Book of Standards, Part 23, Water, Atmospheric Analysis, published by the
American Society for Testing and Materials. Analysis of those pollutants not
covered by these publications shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA). In addition,
all measurements, tests, and analysis of the characteristics of wastewater
shall also be made in conformance with the October 16, 1975 Federal Register,
(40 C.F.R. Part 136) entitled Guidelines for Establishing Test Procedures for
the Analysis of Pollutants.
   (I)   Sampling of industrial wastewater for the purpose of compliance
determination, with respect to the prohibitions and limitations stated in §§
50.056 and
50.057, will be done at such intervals as designated by the city.
   (J)   Duly authorized employees of the city bearing proper credentials and
identifications shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purposes of
inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing pertinent to
discharge to the community system in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
   (K)   Duly authorized city employees are authorized to obtain information
concerning industrial processes which have a direct bearing on the kind and
source of discharge to the wastewater collection system. The industry may
withhold information considered confidential, provided that the industry
establishes that revealing such information to the public might result in an
advantage to competitors.
   (L)   While performing necessary work for private properties referred to in
division (J) of this section, duly authorized employees of the city shall
observe all safety rules applicable to the premises.

   (A)   Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this chapter.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge or prohibited materials shall be
provided and maintained at the owner’s or operator’s own cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be approved by
the city before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans
and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify his or her facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   If, for any reason, a facility does not comply with or will be unable
to comply with any prohibition or limitations in this chapter, the facility
responsible for such discharge shall immediately notify the city so that
corrective action may be taken to protect the treatment system. In addition, a
written report addressed to the city detailing the date, time, and cause of the
accidental discharge; the quantity and characteristics of the discharge, and
corrective action taken to prevent future discharges, shall be filed by the
responsible industrial facility within five days of the occurrence of the
noncomplying discharge.

      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)
(3) of this section.
         (b)   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by

intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.

   (E)   Flashing yellow signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of- way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of- way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (H)   This section does not apply at railroad grade- crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

§ 70.28 PEDESTRIAN-CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (A)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (B)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (C)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (E)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

   (A)   The driver of a vehicle who approaches an intersection where traffic
is controlled by traffic control signals shall do all of the following if the
signal facing the driver exhibits no colored lights or colored lighted arrows,
exhibits a combination of such lights or arrows that fails to clearly indicate
the assignment of right-of-way, or, if the vehicle is a bicycle or an electric
bicycle, the signals are otherwise malfunctioning due to the failure of a

citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the
duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of

citation, or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is
convicted of the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties
provided by law, may impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may
impose the additional fine of not more than $100.
            2.   If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty
for the violation and an additional fine of not more than $100, the court shall
inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine of not more
than $100, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted driving
safety course described in division (B)(2)(a) of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (B) of this section.
      (3)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation,
or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in

judgment.
   (C)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a non-
certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A) or (B) of this section may be admitted into evidence
as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under either a
financial responsibility law suspension at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A) of this section or a nonpayment of judgment suspension at the time
of the alleged violation of division (B) of this section. The person charged
with a violation of division (A) or (B) of this section may offer evidence to
rebut this prima facie evidence.
   (D)   Whoever violates division (A) of this section is guilty of driving
under financial responsibility law suspension or cancellation and shall be

130.99(F)(1)(c) and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3),
the offender may be ordered pursuant to §

      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously was
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section, or

an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss arising from an accident
or collision that was the direct and proximate result of the offender’s
operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing the offense for
which the offender is sentenced under this section.
(R.C. § 4510.16)

pleads guilty to a violation of any provision of this code that is
substantially equivalent to a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, and a court
is permitted or required to suspend a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to

or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02
(A)(5).
   (C)   Suspension of a commercial driver’s license under this section shall
be concurrent with any period of suspension disqualification under R.C. §
3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from holding a
commercial driver’s license under R.C. § 4506.16 shall be issued a driver’s
license under R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the commercial
driver’s license was suspended under this section, and no person whose
commercial driver’s license is suspended under this section shall be issued a

certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator

to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (D)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent

pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was
expired for more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may
impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial
driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or
nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)

   (A)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic-control
device.
   (B)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         (a)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         (b)   When preparing for a left turn;
         (c)   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the
right-hand lane to continue on the driver’s intended route.
      (2)   Nothing in division (B)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (C)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic-control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or
except as permitted under division (A)(2) of this section. This division shall
not be construed as prohibiting the crossing of the center line in making a
left turn into or from an alley, private road, or driveway.

line until the driver has first ascertained that the movement can be made with
safety.
      (2)   Upon a roadway which is divided into three lanes and provides for
the two-way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven in the center
lane, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway is
clearly visible and the center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance,
or when preparing for a left turn, or where the center lane is at the time
allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is
proceeding, and is posted with signs to give notice of such allocation.
      (3)   Official signs may be erected directing specified traffic to use a
designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction, regardless of the center of the roadway, or restricting
the use of a particular lane to only buses during certain hours or during all
hours, and drivers of vehicles shall obey the directions of such signs.

without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every event, the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable, and

section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in

vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent

of the defendant.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) or
(B) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period
of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described

emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this division (D)(1)(b) shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         (c)   As used in division (D)(1)(b) of this section, EMERGENCY MEDICAL
TECHNICIAN-INTERMEDIATE and EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN-PARAMEDIC have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)
(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (D)(1)(b) of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical

within 60 days of sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the term, the offender will not be able
to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of

   (A)   No person shall drive a commercial motor vehicle, as defined in R.C. §
4506.01, or a commercial car or commercial tractor, as defined in R.C. §
4501.01, while the person’s ability or alertness is so impaired by fatigue,

driver in any such condition described in division (A) of this section to drive
such vehicle upon any street or highway.
   (C)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one or more violations of this section or
R.C. § 4511.79, or R.C. § 4511.63, 4511.76, 4511.761, 4511.762, 4511.764, or

(R.C. § 4511.79) (1982 Code, § 73.03)
§ 73.04 IMPLIED CONSENT TO CHEMICAL TESTS OF BLOOD, BREATH, OR URINE.
   (A)   (1)   As used in this section:
         ALCOHOL MONITORING DEVICE. Means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         COMMUNITY ADDICTION SERVICES PROVIDER. Has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5119.01.
         PHYSICAL CONTROL. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4511.194.
      (2)    Any person who operates a vehicle upon a highway or any public or
private property used by the public for vehicular travel or parking within this
municipality or who is in physical control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have
given consent to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of
abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath,
oral fluid, or urine if arrested for a violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (A)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (A)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Any person who is dead or unconscious, or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed to have
consented as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, and the test or tests
may be administered, subject to R.C. §§ 313.12 through 313.16.
      (5)   (a)    If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person
if convicted would be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c),
(d), or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit,
and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine for the purpose of
determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine. A law enforcement officer who
makes a request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical
test or tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required
to give the person the form described in division (C) of this section, but the
officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person
refuses to take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable
means are necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise
the person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (A)(3) and (A)(4) of
this section apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant
to this division.
         (b)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (A)(5)(a) of this section, the law enforcement
officer who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the arresting
law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this section to
any person under arrest for a violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), §
73.02, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance. The officer shall
give that advice in a written form that contains the information described in
division (C) of this section and shall read the advice to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest
and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or more persons shall
witness the arresting officer’s reading of the form, and the witnesses shall
certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the
chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer,
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does
not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to
submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (C)    Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the
following form to the person:
You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state law or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state OVI, and, if
you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken at
your own expense.
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it
to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the
arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is
not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of §
73.02, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
person submits to the test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting officer
shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (C) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)    Division (E)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who
is asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests
under this section, and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance that the test results indicate is present in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine.
   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (G)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197 relative to any
suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the
report.
(R.C. § 4511.192)
   (H)   (1)   A suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege under this section for the
time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) is effective immediately from the
time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension upon the
arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the
charge that resulted in the person’s being requested to take the chemical test
or tests under division (A) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §
73.02 or R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
regardless of whether the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. §
4511.191(B) or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the
charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons’
arrest or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any
continuance granted by the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the
issues specified in that section.

§ 74.118 WEIGHING OF VEHICLE; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD.
   (A)   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle and its load is unlawful may require the driver of the vehicle to stop
and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self- contained,
portable, sealed scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
vehicles on highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel
loads of highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed
location, having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the
combined load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a
highway vehicle; or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded
or unloaded.
   (B)   The driver of the vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed
to the nearest available sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided the
scales are within three miles of the point where the vehicle is stopped.
   (C)   Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the
police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section.
   (D)   All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and its
load shall be annually compared by a municipal, county or state sealer with the
state standards or standards approved by the state, and the scales shall not be
sealed if they do not conform to the state standards or standards approved by
the state.
   (E)   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and
width to insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on a level terrain of sufficient length and
width to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be
level, or if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in
elevation between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-quarter
inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   (F)   In all determinations of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, 12 feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the
outside wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use
of compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   (G)   Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that
the weight is unlawful, he or she may require the driver to stop the vehicle in
a suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed
as is necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted
under R.C. §§ 5577.01 through 5577.14 and this chapter.

attending a program offered by a head start agency, shall stop at least ten
feet from the front or rear of the school bus and shall not proceed until such
school bus resumes motion, or until signaled by the school bus driver to

involved failed to display or be equipped with an automatically extended stop
warning sign as required by division (B) of this section.
   (B)    Every school bus shall be equipped with amber and red visual signals
meeting the requirements of R.C. § 4511.771 or a substantially equivalent

health and county boards of developmental disabilities, or children attending
programs offered by head start agencies. A school bus driver shall not actuate
the visual signals or the stop warning sign in designated school bus loading
areas where the bus is entirely off the roadway or at school buildings when
children or persons attending programs offered by community boards of mental
health and county boards of developmental disabilities are loading or unloading

opposite direction which has stopped for the purpose of receiving or
discharging any school child, persons attending programs offered by community
boards of mental health and county boards of developmental disabilities, or
children attending programs offered by head start agencies. The driver of any
vehicle overtaking the school bus shall comply with division (A) above.
   (D)   School buses operating on divided highways or on highways with four or

   (E)   No school bus driver shall start the driver’s bus until after any
child, person attending programs offered by community boards of mental health
and county boards of developmental disabilities, or child attending a program
offered by a head start agency who may have alighted therefrom has reached a
place of safety on the child’s or person’s residence side of the road.
   (F)   (1)   Whoever violates division (A) of this section may be fined an
amount not to exceed $500. A person who is issued a citation for a violation of
division (A) of this section is not permitted to enter a written plea of guilty
and waive the person’s right to contest the citation in a trial but instead
must appear in person in the proper court to answer the charge.
      (2)   In addition to and independent of any other penalty provided by
law, the court or mayor may impose upon an offender who violates this section a
class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(7). When a
license is suspended under this section, the court or mayor shall cause the
offender to deliver the license to the court, and the court or clerk of the
court immediately shall forward the license to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
together with notice of the court’s action.

by a head start agency, means a bus that is owned and operated by a head start
agency, is equipped with an automatically extended stop warning sign of a type

agency shall conduct an investigation to attempt to determine the identity of

ordinance. However, if the identity of the operator of the vehicle at the time
of the alleged violation cannot be established, the law enforcement agency

adopted herein, is to prescribe regulations consistent with the general laws of
the state and nationally recognized good practice for the safeguarding, to a
reasonable degree, of life and property from the hazards of fire and explosion
arising from the storage, handling, and use of hazardous substances, materials,
and devices, and from conditions hazardous to life or property in the use or
occupancy of buildings or premises. Compliance with standards of the National

shall be deemed to be prima facie evidence of compliance with this intent.
   (B)   Intent of Code. It is the intent of the Fire Prevention Code to
prescribe regulations consistent with both state and nationally recognized good
standards and practices for the safeguarding of life and property from the
hazards of fire and explosion. Compliance with the latest standards of the
American Insurance Association, the National Fire Protection Association, the
National Fire Codes, the Ohio State Fire Code, or other approved state or
nationally recognized safety standards shall be deemed to be prima facie
evidence of compliance with this intent.
   (C)   Application of the Code. The provisions of the city Fire Code shall
apply equally to new and existing conditions.
      (1)   All newly constructed buildings shall comply with the intent of
this Code prior to their being occupied.
      (2)   All existing buildings shall comply with the intent of this Code
within one year of the effective date of this section.
      (3)   All buildings that are vacated or closed for 30 days shall comply
with the intent of this Code prior to their being reoccupied.
      (4)   If in the event of a building or a business changing ownership or
occupancy, then this building or business shall be required to comply with the
intent of this Code immediately.
   (D)   Authority to enter premises. The Chief of the Fire Department, Chief
of the Fire Prevention Bureau, or any inspector that they may assign, may at
all reasonable hours enter any building or premises for the purpose of making

91.99
§ 91.11 SMOKE DETECTORS.
   (A)   It shall be the responsibility of the owner of each new and existing
occupied multiple-family dwelling structure to install and maintain in proper
working order smoke detectors in each such dwelling unit as hereinafter
provided. The smoke detectors shall be capable of sensing visible or invisible
particles of combustion and of providing a suitable audible alarm. Failure to
install smoke detectors as and where required by that date will subject the
property owner to the penalties set forth herein.
   (B)   At least one smoke detector shall be installed to protect each
sleeping area. A SLEEPING AREA is defined as the area or areas of the multiple-
family living unit in which the bedrooms (or sleeping rooms) are located. Where
bedrooms or rooms ordinarily used for sleeping are separated by other-use areas
(such as kitchens or living rooms, but not bathrooms or closets), they shall be
considered as separate sleeping areas for the purposes of this section. At
least one smoke detector shall be installed at the head of stairways leading to
occupied floors containing sleeping rooms or areas in such manner as to assure
that rising smoke is not obstructed in reaching the detector, and the detector
intercepts rising smoke before it reaches the sleeping area. At least one smoke
detector shall be installed in all basement or cellar areas. In all dwelling
units sharing a common means of egress hallway, an adequate number of smoke
detectors shall be installed in such hallways.
   (C)   As an alternative to self-contained smoke detectors, an approved fire
detection system may be installed. Each fire detection system must be
individually approved and a permit issued therefor by the Fire Chief.
   (D)   All devices, combinations of devices, and equipment required herein
are to be installed in conformance with the Building Code and this section,
approved by the Fire Inspector, and listed by the Fire Department for the
purpose for which they are intended; the list may be subsequently amended as
necessary. The approval shall be permanent unless the Fire Chief subsequently
finds that the equipment is hazardous or unreliable, in which case, the Fire
Chief may suspend or revoke approval. The Fire Chief may in any such case
determine whether replacement of existing installation shall be required.
   (E)   In new multiple-dwellings, smoke detectors shall be wired directly
(hard-wired) to the building’s power supply. In existing dwellings, it is
preferred that smoke detectors be wired directly to power supply; however, the
detectors may be powered by self-monitored battery or operated in a plug-in
outlet which is fitted with a plug restrainer device, provided the outlet is
not controlled by any switch other than the main power supply.
   (F)   This section is intended to be used with and supplemented by the
applicable provisions of the current edition of the National Fire Protection
Association Standards and the current edition of National Fire Protection
Association Standards, which are hereby incorporated herein; however, if there
shall be any conflict between this section and the supplemental standards, this
section and any rules and regulations adopted pursuant hereto shall prevail.
   (G)   The Safety and Service Director shall have concurrent jurisdiction
with the Fire Chief, Fire Inspectors, and any State Building Inspector to
inspect the installation of any smoke detectors required to be installed by
this section, and violations found to exist shall subject the property owners
to the penalties set forth herein.
   (H)   If any authorized representative inspector of the city, upon
inspection, shall determine that any provision of this section has been
violated, he or she shall issue a written notice of such fact to the owner or
person in charge of the property, which notice shall inform the owner or person
in charge of the property, that said owner of the property has 30 days after
the date of the notice to conform to the provisions of this section or be
subject to the penalties and remedies provided in this section. No owner or
person in charge of property or premises subject to the provisions of this
section shall refuse to allow inspection of the property or premises by duly
authorized inspection representatives of the city at all reasonable times, and
after notice as herein provided.

producing device, except such torches, welding or heating equipment as may be
used by workmen in repairing or maintaining the building or equipment therein,

beauty parlors located in such retail stores, or to other areas therein where
merchandise is not stored or displayed.

§ 98.01 PURPOSE.
   In order to reduce the number of false alarms and increase time for police
officers to respond to actual emergencies and other legitimate calls for
service, the city adopts this
Chapter 98 “Automatic Alarm Systems” to regulate alarms within the city.
(Ord. 2019-11, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 98.02 BASIS.
   Studies have consistently shown that 98% of the alarms to which police
respond are false. The major cause of false alarms is user error, usually
either opening or closing errors, and improper maintenance. Each alarm response
requires a minimum of two patrol officers and averages 15 minutes per officer,
per alarm. This equates to hundreds of hours of City Police Department time
diverted away from actual police work. These false alarms negatively influence
the overall safety of the community, leaving officers with diminished time to
respond to actual emergencies.
(Ord. 2019-11, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 98.03 PERMIT.
   Every residence or business operating an alarm system in the city must
obtain a permit. No action is needed by the alarm user for the alarm permit
registration. The alarm company is required to register the alarm and
administer the one-time permit fee of $15.
(Ord. 2019-11, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 98.04 FALSE ALARMS.
   In order to encourage accountability and responsibility of alarm users, the
city will charge alarm owners for false alarms. Because no alarm user is
perfect, two false alarms in a rolling 12-month period are allowed without a
penalty assessed. However, after two false alarms, a progressive fee will be
assessed beginning at $35 for the third false alarm and up to and through the
eighth false alarm at $100.
(Ord. 2019-11, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 98.05 UNPERMITTED USERS.
   Unpermitted alarm users will be sent a warning and notice to permit on the
first false alarm, the second false alarm will be a $100 fee and the alarm site
may be placed on verified response.
(Ord. 2019-11, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 98.06 APPEAL.
   Alarm users may appeal false alarm fines to the Safety and Service Director.
The city defines a FALSE ALARM as an alarm dispatch request to a law
enforcement agency, when the responding law enforcement officer finds no
evidence of a criminal offense or attempted criminal offense after having
completed a timely investigation of the alarm site.
(Ord. 2019-11, passed 4-13-2020)
§ 98.07 RULES.
   The Chief of Police may make such regulations to administer this chapter as
are consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter as the Chief deems
advisable.

§ 99.37 COMPLAINT PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file within
360 days of the alleged violation with the Human Rights Board a complaint in
writing, sworn to or affirmed, which shall state: the name and address of the
person aggrieved; the name and address of the person against whom the complaint
is filed; a description and the address of the dwelling, which involves the
alleged discriminatory housing practice or employment practice; a concise

discriminatory housing or employment practice, and such other information as
may be required by the Board. The complaint may be reasonably and fairly
amended. The Board may also corroborate or initiate complaints on the basis of
studies carried out by its staff or volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (B)   Upon the filing of the complaint, the Secretary of the Board shall
make such investigations as he or she deems appropriate to ascertain facts and
issues. The investigation shall be conducted within 14 business days after the
filing of the complaint. The investigation may be extended when deemed
necessary by the Chairperson of the Human Rights Board. If the Secretary shall
determine that there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation has
occurred, he or she shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of
initial conference and persuasion with all interested parties and such
representatives as the parties may choose to assist them. Conciliation
conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done during such initial
conferences shall be made public by any member of the Board or its staff unless
the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (C)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes and does not constitute an
admission by any parties that the law has been violated. Consent agreement
shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its Chairperson.
   (D)   The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Commission, Ohio Civil Rights Commission, or the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development and any other person or group regarding any
matters before the Board.
   (E)   If the Secretary determines that the complaint lacks reasonable
grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he or she shall so
inform the Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or
order such further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board
shall not dismiss such complaint without first affording either party an
opportunity to appear before the Board.
   (F)   If the Secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this chapter fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or an informal consent agreement or determine that a complaint is not
susceptible of conciliation, he or she shall so notify the Board and the Board
shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of
this chapter has been committed. The Board shall serve upon the respondent a
written statement of charges and a summons and shall serve upon all interested
parties a notice of the time and place of the hearing. The respondent or his or
her authorized counsel may file and amend such statements with the Board prior
to the hearing date as it deems necessary in support of its position. The
hearing shall be open to the public. The hearing shall be held not less than 15
calendar days nor more than 30 calendar days after service of the statement of
charges and summons. The summons so issued must be signed by two members of the
Board and the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of named
persons and the production of relevant documents and records. The failure to
comply with a summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The
interested parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or
by a duly authorized representative and may have the assistance of an attorney.
The parties may present testimony in evidence and the right to cross-examine
witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony in evidence shall be given under
oath or by affirmation. The Secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing,
which records shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon
request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such
party a copy of the hearing record, at such cost as the Board deems
appropriate.
   (G)   If, at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has
violated this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the legal
counsel, in executive session, state its finding to and call the legal counsel
to prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person
complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take
such affirmative action as will effectuate the purpose of this chapter, with
notice that if the Board upon investigation by the Secretary determines that
the person complained against has not after 15 calendar days following service
of the Board’s order complied with the order, the Board will recertify the
matter to legal counsel for enforcement. Legal counsel shall seek compliance by
appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Human Rights Board of the
city before a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (H)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon the
preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained against
has not violated this chapter, the Board shall so state and publish its
findings and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (A)(1) or (A)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of R.C. § 2913.49
shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a
party to the offense.
   (C)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in division (A)(1) or (A)
(3) of this section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the
following offenses during the following specified periods of time:
         (a)   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public
servant at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter;
         (b)   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this division:
         OFFENSE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE MISCONDUCT IN OFFICE OF A PUBLIC
SERVANT. The phrase includes but is not limited to a violation of R.C. §
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43(A) or
(B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense involving
misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any municipal
ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code sections listed
in this division (C)(2).
         PUBLIC SERVANT. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2921.01.
   (D)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined to
match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time of
the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced
within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, DNA RECORD has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (E)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (F)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (G)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (H)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused departed this
municipality or conceals the accused’s identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused’s purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (I)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this state, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (J)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Title XIII or Title
XXIX of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (K)   As used in this section, PEACE OFFICER has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 2935.01.
   (L)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (A) and (D) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03
committed on and after July 16, 2015, and apply to a violation of either of
those sections committed prior to July 16, 2015, if prosecution for that
violation was not barred under this section as it existed on July 16, 2015.
      (2)   The amendment to division (A)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and
applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.

§ 130.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      CULPABILITY. Means purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in R.C. § 2901.22.
      INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from
the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Means reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      POSSESSION. Means a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21) (1982 Code, § 130.07)
§ 130.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22) (1982 Code, § 130.08)
§ 130.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. The term does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23) (1982 Code, § 130.09)
§ 130.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C.
§ 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if
he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24) (1982 Code, § 130.10)
§ 130.11 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.

§ 130.12 COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of R.C. § 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.

   (A)   Any person convicted of a violation of state or local law within the
city or upon city property for which conviction a jail sentence is imposed,
shall be required to pay for the actual cost to the city for any jail time
served by the person, upon completion of the sentence.
   (B)   The City Auditor, after billing the convicted person and receiving no
satisfaction for a period of 30 days, shall certify the costs to the Director
of Law for collection in the name of the city as in other civil cases.

      (3)   The Police Department, with custody of property to be disposed of
under this section or R.C. §§ 2981.12 or 2981.13, shall make a reasonable
effort to locate persons entitled to possession of the property, to notify them
of when and where it may be claimed, and to return the property to them at the
earliest possible time. In the absence of evidence identifying persons entitled
to possession, it is sufficient notice to advertise in a newspaper of general

shall be sold by the Division of Liquor Control if the Division determines that
it is fit for sale or shall be placed in the custody of the Investigations Unit
in the Ohio Department of Public Safety and be used for training relating to
law enforcement activities. The Ohio Department of Public Safety, with the
assistance of the Division of Liquor Control, shall adopt rules in accordance
with R.C. Chapter 119 to provide for the distribution to state or local law

recognition with the Police Department. When the Board recognizes a citizens’
reward program and the county includes a part, but not all, of the territory of
the municipality, the Board shall so notify the Police Department of the
recognition of the citizens’ reward program only if the county contains the
highest percentage of the municipality’s population.
         (b)   Upon being so notified, the Police Department shall pay 25% of
any forfeited proceeds or cash derived from each sale of property disposed of
pursuant to this section to the citizens’ reward program for use exclusively to
pay rewards. No part of the funds may be used to pay expenses associated with
the program. If a citizens’ reward program that operates in more than one
county or in another state in addition to this state receives funds under this
section, the funds shall be used to pay rewards only for tips and information
to law enforcement agencies concerning offenses committed in the county from
which the funds were received.
      (6)   Any property forfeited under R.C. Chapter 2981 not be used to pay
any fine imposed upon a person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an
underlying criminal offense or a different offense arising out of the same
facts and circumstances.
      (7)   Any monies acquired from the sale of personal effects, tools, or
other property seized because the personal effects, tools, or other property
were used in the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2905.32, 2907.21, or
2907.22 or derived from the proceeds of the commission of a violation of R.C. §
2905.32, 2907.21, or 2907.22 and disposed of pursuant to this division (B)
shall be placed in the Victims of Human Trafficking Fund created by R.C. §
5101.87.
(R.C. § 2981.12)
   (C)   Disposition of contraband, proceeds, or instrumentalities. Except as
otherwise provided in R.C. § 2981.13, property ordered forfeited as contraband,
proceeds, or an instrumentality pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2981 shall be disposed
of, used, or sold pursuant to division (B) of this section or R.C. § 2981.12.
If the property is to be sold under division (B) of this section or R.C. §
2981.12, the prosecutor shall cause notice of the proposed sale to be given in
accordance with law.

§ 130.16 SELF-DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (C)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09) (1982 Code, § 130.16)
§ 130.17 PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE; PROOF OF OFFENSE; AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.
   (A)   Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of
the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the
evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof by a preponderance
of the evidence, for an affirmative defense other than self-defense, defense of
another, or defense of the accused's residence presented as described in
division (B)(1) of this section, is upon the accused.
   (B)   (1)   A person is allowed to act in self-defense, defense of another,
or defense of that person’s residence. If, at the trial of a person who is
accused of an offense that involved the person’s use of force against another,
there is evidence presented that tends to support that the accused person used
the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person’s
residence, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another, or
defense of that person’s residence, as the case may be.
      (2)   Subject to division (B)(3) of this section, a person is presumed to
have acted in self-defense or defense of another when using defensive force
that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if
the person against whom the defensive force is used is in the process of
unlawfully and without privilege to do so entering, or has unlawfully and
without privilege to do so entered, the residence or vehicle occupied by the
person using the defensive force.
      (3)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section does
not apply if either of the following is true:
         (a)   The person against whom the defensive force is used has a right
to be in, or is a lawful resident of, the residence or vehicle.
         (b)   The person who uses the defensive force uses it while in a
residence or vehicle and the person is unlawfully, and without privilege to be,
in that residence or vehicle.
      (4)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section is a
rebuttable presumption and may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence,
provided that the prosecution’s burden of proof remains proof beyond a
reasonable doubt as described in divisions (A) and (B)(1) of this section.
   (C)   As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, the court shall
read the definitions of "reasonable doubt" and "proof beyond a reasonable
doubt", contained in division (E) of this section.
   (D)   As used in this section:
      AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. An affirmative defense is either of the following:
         (a)   A defense expressly designated as affirmative;
         (b)   A defense involving an excuse or justification peculiarly within
the knowledge of the accused, on which the accused can fairly be required to
adduce supporting evidence.
      DWELLING. Means a building or conveyance of any kind that has a roof over
it and that is designed to be occupied by people lodging in the building or
conveyance at night, regardless of whether the building or conveyance is
temporary or permanent or is mobile or immobile. As used in this division, a
building or conveyance includes but is not limited to an attached porch, and a
building or conveyance with a roof over it includes but is not limited to a
tent.
      RESIDENCE. Means a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily
or permanently or is visiting as a guest.
      VEHICLE. Means a conveyance of any kind, whether or not motorized, that
is designed to transport people or property.
   (E)   "Reasonable doubt" is present when the jurors, after they have
carefully considered and compared all the evidence, cannot say they are firmly
convinced of the truth of the charge. It is a doubt based on reasonable and
common sense. Reasonable doubt is not mere possible doubt, because everything
relating to human affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some
possible or imaginary doubt. "Proof beyond a reasonable doubt" is proof of such
character that an ordinary person would be willing to rely and act upon it in
the most important of the person's own affairs.
(R.C. § 2901.05)
§ 130.18 BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME.
   (A)   The municipality hereby declares that it recognizes both of the
following, in relation to the “battered woman syndrome”: that the syndrome
currently is a matter of commonly accepted scientific knowledge, and that the
subject matter and details of the syndrome are not within the general
understanding or experience of a person who is a member of the general populace
and are not within the field of common knowledge.
   (B)   If a person is charged with an offense involving the use of force
against another and the person, as a defense to the offense charged, raises the
affirmative defense of self defense, the person may introduce expert testimony
of the “battered woman syndrome” and expert testimony that the person suffered
from that syndrome as evidence to establish the requisite belief of an imminent
danger of death or great bodily harm that is necessary, as an element of the
affirmative defense, to justify the person’s use of force in question. The
introduction of any expert testimony under this division shall be in accordance
with the Ohio Rules of Evidence.
(R.C. § 2901.06)
§ 130.19 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (A)   A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this municipality,
any element of which takes place in this municipality;
      (2)   While in this municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this municipality and the
other jurisdiction, or, while in this municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under
both the laws of this municipality and the other jurisdiction, and a
substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this
municipality by the person or another person involved in the conspiracy,
subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality;
      (4)   While out of this municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction, or activity in this municipality;
      (5)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this municipality;
      (6)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another person and subsequently brings the other person into this
municipality;
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
municipality in violation of the law of this state or municipality.
   (B)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (A)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense
in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this municipality.
   (C)   (1)   This municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto, and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest
shore of the Ohio River extending to the opposite shore line, between the
extended boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each of
those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio River with
any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any
court of Kentucky or of West Virginia that borders on the Ohio River and that
has jurisdiction on the Ohio River under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.
   (D)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
municipality for purposes of this section.
   (E)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this municipality.
   (F)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (G)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this municipality.
   (H)   For purposes of division (A)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (I)   As used in this section, COMPUTER, COMPUTER SYSTEM, COMPUTER NETWORK,
INFORMATION SERVICE, TELECOMMUNICATION, TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEVICE,
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE, DATA and WRITING have the same meanings as in R.C.

§ 130.20 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (A)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by R.C. §
1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Ohio
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of §
130.99 or
133.99 of this code or R.C. §§ 2929.23 through 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under §
130.99(C) through (G). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (B)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         (a)   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         (b)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         (c)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         (d)   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability, or other factor
made the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of
the offense more serious;
         (e)   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)(b) and
(B)(1)(c) of this section;
         (f)   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         (g)   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, if the
offender enters an Alford plea, the sentencing court shall not consider whether
the offender showed genuine remorse for the offense.
      (3)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (B)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
   (C)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
130.99(D), (E), (F), and (G). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
130.99(C) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (D)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim's representative, the victim's
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 through 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22)
§ 130.21 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, R.C. § 2929.14(C),
or R.C. § 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, this
state, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (B)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (B)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)    A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06, 2903.08
or 4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the operation of a
vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state correctional institution
when the trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively. When
consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and prison terms are
imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this
division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms
imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before
serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41)
§ 130.22 APPREHENSION, DETENTION, OR ARREST OF PERSONS ON BOND.
   (A)   No person, other than a law enforcement officer, shall apprehend,
detain, or arrest a principal on bond, wherever issued, unless that person
meets all of the following criteria:
      (1)   The person is any of the following:
         (a)   Qualified, licensed, and appointed as a surety bail bond agent
under R.C. §§ 3905.83 through 3905.95;
         (b)   Licensed as a surety bail bond agent by the state where the bond
was written;
         (c)   Licensed as a private investigator under R.C. Chapter 4749;
         (d)   Licensed as a private investigator by the state where the bond
was written;
         (e)   An off-duty peace officer, as defined in R.C. § 2921.51.
      (2)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has entered into a written contract with the surety or with a
licensed surety bail bond agent appointed by the surety, which contract sets
forth the name of the principal who is to be apprehended, detained, or
arrested. For purposes of this division (A)(2), SURETY has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 3905.83.
      (3)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has notified the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction
over the area in which such activities will be performed and has provided any
form or identification or other information requested by the law enforcement
agency.
   (B)   No person shall represent the person’s self to be a bail enforcement
agent or bounty hunter, or claim any similar title, in this municipality.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of illegal bail bond agent
practices.
      (1)   A violation of division (A) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (A) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (B) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (B) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
(R.C. § 2927.27)
§ 130.99 PENALTY FOR TITLE XIII.
   (A)   Generally. Except where otherwise specifically classified within the
body of the section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section
shall be deemed a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more
than $500, imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) through (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
130.18 or
133.99 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(5)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(5)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(5)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §§
130.18 and
133.99 of this code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (D)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five- year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B, and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         (c)   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor
of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or
fourth degree;
         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         (f)   A term of basic probation supervision;
         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (G) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (G), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (G) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or the victim's estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim's representative, victim's attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor's designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim's costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim's representative, victim's attorney, if applicable, or victim's estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim's estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim's attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim's estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
(G)(1)(b)2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by
law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including but not limited to the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including but not limited to a per diem fee for room and
board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of repairing
property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s General Fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the
treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor domestic
violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than $70 nor
more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (G)(4)(b) and (G)
(4)(c) of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be credited
to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         (b)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         (c)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law

§ 131.41 VALUE OF STOLEN PROPERTY.
   (A)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of R.C. § 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (B)   (1)   When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A), R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or
2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. § 2913.31 or 2913.43 involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a
series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts
to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations
of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service
member or spouse of an active duty service member, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. The value of
the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §
2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more than one
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant
to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a
single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the
property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value as
required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2) or
(B)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (B)
(1) or (B)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (B)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (C)(2) of this section, and the value of services, is
the fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section,
FAIR MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a
seller would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is
willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed
as to all facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any
compulsion to act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further written
request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the
measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at
conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number of
unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

section or R.C. § 2925.51 or in any other manner on any substance that was the
basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance
contained any amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests
indicate that the substance tested contained any controlled substance. No court

tested contained any controlled substance. The court shall hold a hearing to

§ 150.04 DANGEROUS PROPERTY AND/OR STRUCTURES; INSPECTION, REPAIR OR REMOVAL.
   (A)   On information or complaint, the Housing Inspector shall investigate
complaints that a property or other structure in the city is dangerous, unsafe,
unsecure or structurally defective so as to pose a danger to the safety of the
inhabitants, visitors, the public, or juvenile trespassers. In performance of
this function, the Housing Inspector shall acquire such expertise as the
Housing Inspector may deem necessary, including, but not limited to, engineers,
architects, property contractors, and/or fire inspectors. The Housing Inspector
may utilize funds from the administrative appropriations for the Mayor’s office
for this purpose. The Fire Chief, or other fire official, and the Law Director
or any deputy thereof, shall provide advice at the Housing Inspector’s request.
   (B)   If the Housing Inspector finds from a preliminary investigation that
any property or other structure is likely to pose a threat to the safety of
persons in or around the property or structure, the Housing Inspector shall
send written notice of such finding to the owners, the tenants, the lien
holders, any person to whom tax notices are mailed by the County Treasurer, or
any other person the Law Director discovers to have any interest in the
premises upon a review of county records. The notice shall contain the nature
of the defect which renders the property or structure to be unsecure, unsound,
or structurally defective. In addition thereto the notice shall also contain
the remedy sought whether that be repair or removal of the property or
structure. The written notice shall be by certified U.S. mail or by personal
service. If service is returned incomplete because of refusal or being
unclaimed, ordinary U.S. mail shall be sufficient notice with proof of mailing.
If service cannot be completed otherwise, notice may be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the county, and shall be complete upon
publication once.
   (C)   Any interested person may file written objections with the Housing
Inspector’s finding that a property or structure is unsecure, unsafe, or
structurally defective within 30 days of receipt or of publication of the
finding. All objections must be in writing. An objection is considered to be
filed upon receipt in the office of the Housing Inspector by certified mail or
personal service. If no objections are filed with the Housing Inspector within
30 days, the Housing Inspector may do any or all of the following:
      (1)   Enter the premises with the assistance of the Police Department and
make a closer inspection of the premises;
      (2)   Abate any serious nuisance posing an immediate threat to public
safety;
      (3)   Ban entry into the property and post notices of the same on the
property, under penalty of arrest for trespassing;
      (4)   Solicit bids for the repair of the property and removal of any
debris or dangerous parts;
      (5)   Solicit bids for the demolition of the property and removal of the
debris; and
      (6)   Summon interested parties to a hearing before the Housing Inspector
to acquire further facts.
   (D)   If objections are timely filed, the Housing Inspector shall summon all
interested parties to a hearing before the Property, Maintenance and
Restoration Committee to present witnesses and evidence concerning the notice
and finding. All testimony shall be under oath or affirmation and the Housing
Inspector shall make a complete record of the evidence and the Property,
Maintenance and Restoration Committee findings with respect thereto. If a
compromise is reached with the interested parties, the Housing Inspector shall
reduce the compromise to writing and obtain the signature of all participating
parties. This compromise agreement shall have the force and effect of a consent
decree and may be enforced in any court of general jurisdiction. If the
Property, Maintenance and Restoration Committee finds no basis for the original
complaint or finding, the Housing Inspector shall take no action. If the
Property, Maintenance and Restoration Committee finds a reasonable basis for
the complaint, the Property, Maintenance and Restoration Committee shall do one
the following:
      (1)   Immediately order the Housing Inspector to abate the nuisance by
obtaining bids for either the destruction and removal of the unsecure, unsafe,
or structurally defective property or structure and proceed with demolition
without undue delay, or by obtaining bids for the sealing of the unsecure,
unsafe or structurally defective property or structure to prevent unauthorized
entry and proceed to seal the property until further order of the Property,
Maintenance and Restoration Committee, or to obtain bids for the repair of the
unsecure, unsafe, or structurally defective property in order to abate the
immediate nuisance and make the property minimally safe; or
      (2)   Submit findings and conclusions to the City Council for a
determination as to whether to demolish the unsecure, unsafe or structurally
defective property or structure by resolution of Council, or to repair the
unsecure, unsafe or structurally defective property in order to make the
property minimally safe, or to seal the unsafe, unsecure, or structurally
defective property to prevent unauthorized entry thereto.
   (E)   If any city funds are utilized to demolish, seal, or repair an
unsecure, unsafe, or structurally defective properties or structures, the same
shall be certified to the County Auditor for inclusion on the tax duplicate of
the property.

   This chapter is adopted to establish a program for identifying and
registering vacant commercial and industrial buildings within the city that may
present a fire hazard, that may provide temporary occupancy by transients, that
may detract from private and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain
surrounding buildings, and that may present a hazard to the health, safety, and
welfare of the public. Through a registration, inspection, and monitoring
process, vacant commercial and industrial buildings will be kept weather-tight
and secure from trespassers, will provide safe entry to police officers and
firefighters in times of emergency, will not impede private and/or public
efforts to rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and will not
otherwise present a public hazard so that the health, safety, and welfare of
the public is served by these regulations.

§ 153.05 REGISTRATION FEES.
   (A) Vacant commercial and industrial building registration fees shall be
reasonably related to the administrative costs of the vacant commercial and
industrial building registration process and for the costs incurred by the city
in monitoring the vacant commercial or industrial building site. The annual
increase in registration fee amounts shall be reasonably related to the costs
incurred by the city for hazard abatement, repair, and/or demolition of vacant
commercial and industrial buildings in addition to the continued administrative
costs. Money collected under this section shall be used exclusively for the
administration and enforcement of this chapter.
   (B)    The annual registration fee for a vacant commercial or industrial
building shall be based on the duration of time the building has been vacant
regardless of a change in ownership. The owner of a vacant commercial or
industrial building shall pay an initial registration fee of $1,000 for the
first year the building remains vacant. For every consecutive year that the
building remains vacant, the annual registration fee shall be assessed at
double the previous year's registration fee amount for a maximum annual
registration fee equaling the two-year registration fee of $2,000 which shall
be the registration fee for the second and all consecutive, subsequent years of
vacancy.
   (C)   The registration fee shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of
any building permits. The Safety and Service Director shall refund the vacant
commercial or industrial building registration fee paid if the subject building
is brought into compliance with standards of the Ohio Building Code and
reoccupied within one year of payment of the annual registration fee. The
refund shall be for the amount of the registration fee paid during the year in
which the building was approved for re-occupancy. Registration fees paid in
previous years shall not be refunded.
   (D)   If a registration form is filed late, an additional late fee shall be
paid in addition to the annual registration fee and shall be equal to the
annual registration fee or $1,000, whichever is less.
   (E)   All delinquent registration fees shall be paid by the owner prior to
any transfer of an ownership interest in the vacant commercial or industrial
building.
   (F)   If an owner or person in control of a vacant commercial or industrial
building or a purchaser fails, neglects, or refuses to pay a registration fee
within the time ordered pursuant to this section then the Safety and Service
Director shall so notify the Auditor. The Auditor shall certify the
registration fee to the County Auditor. In addition to the registration fee, an
interest rate equal to the current rate of interest charged by the city on
special assessments shall be imposed by the city for the life of the
registration fee, added to the registration fee, and collected as provided in
this section. The Auditor shall then certify the amount of the registration
fee, including interest, to the County Auditor. The County Auditor shall enter
the amount on the tax duplicate of the county as a special assessment against
the person’s real estate that is subject to the registration fee.

cases, an application to rezone the property is required.
   (D)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not grant variances, as authorized
in this zoning code, unless it can determine that there is a justifiable reason
for the variance. The evaluation shall include, but is not limited to, the
following factors:
      (1)   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district; examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are: exceptional irregularity,
narrowness, shallowness, or steepness of the lot; or adjacency to nonconforming
and inharmonious uses, structures, or conditions;
      (2)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (3)   Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary to
make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
      (4)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjacent properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
      (5)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, and refuse pick-up;
      (6)   Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the owner;
      (7)   Whether the property owner’s predicament can feasibly be remedied
through some method other than a variance;
      (8)   Whether the spirit and intent behind these code requirements would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance;
      (9)   Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the
owner any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district;
      (10)   No single factor listed above may control, and not all factors may
be applicable in each case. Each case shall be determined on its own facts; and
      (11)   Following a public hearing, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
approve, approve with condition, or disapprove the request. If the variance is
denied by the Board of Zoning Appeals, the owner or agent may appeal the
decision to City Council.

§ 155.046 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   (A)   Purpose. Conditional use permits shall be required for types of uses
designated as conditionally permitted in a particular zoning district. Such
particular use may be permitted and desirable in certain districts, but not
without consideration. In each case, the effect of the use upon neighboring
land will be reviewed. The application of the planning standards for
determining the location and extent of such use is a planning function, and not
in the nature of a variance or an appeal. Enumerated throughout this code are
certain uses and the districts in which they may be permitted as conditional
uses provided the following standards are fulfilled and a conditional use
permit is granted by the Planning Commission. Application requirements shall be
as established on the checklist provided by the city. (City forms and
checklists are available on the city’s website.)
   (B)   Application and notification requirements.
      (1)   An owner or owner’s authorized agent shall submit an application
for a conditional use permit.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing subject to the
requirements of §
155.041(C) (Public Notification for Public Hearing).
   (C)   Review factors. The Planning Commission shall consider the following
standards when determining whether the issuance of a conditional use permit is
warranted.
      (1)   The conditional use is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of the city’s various plans and studies and will not negatively affect
or harm the appropriate use of neighboring property.
      (2)   The proposed conditional use is to be located in a district wherein
such use may be permitted, subject to the requirements of this section.
      (3)   The use complies with all applicable use-specific provisions
established in §
155.072 (Permitted Uses).
      (4)   The proposed use shall be adequately served by essential public
facilities and services such as, but not limited to, roads, public safety
forces, stormwater facilities, water, sanitary sewer, refuse pick-up, and
schools, or that the persons or agencies responsible for the establishment of
the proposed use shall be able to provide adequately for any such services.
      (5)   The proposed use will comply with all applicable development
standards, except as specifically altered by the Planning Commission in the
approved conditional use.
      (6)   The proposed use will be harmonious with the existing or intended
character of the area, will not be hazardous or have a negative impact on
adjacent properties, and will not be detrimental to property values or the
economic welfare of the general vicinity.
      (7)   The proposed use will not be detrimental to any persons, property,
or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,
smoke, fumes, glare, odor, or other characteristic that is not compatible to
the uses permitted in the applicable zoning district.
      (8)   The proposed use will not impede the normal and orderly development
and improvement of the surrounding properties for uses permitted in the
district.
   (D)   Approval conditions.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall approve the conditional use permit if
it determines that the proposed application satisfies the standards set forth
in division (C) (Review Factors) of this section.
      (2)   If the Planning Commission determines that the issuance of a
conditional use permit is warranted, the Planning Commission may condition such
issuance upon specific requirements and limitations with respect to the
location, construction, maintenance, landscaping, operation, and other factors
and features of the application it deems necessary or appropriate to protect
the interests of the community and to ensure satisfaction of the standards set
forth in division (C) (Review Factors) of this section.
      (3)   If the Planning Commission determines that such proposed use does
not, and with the imposition of conditions, will not, satisfy the standards set
forth in division (C) (Review Factors) of this section, the Planning Commission
shall deny the issuance of a conditional use permit.
      (4)   If the Planning Commission denies the conditional use permit, the
owner or the authorized agent has the option to appeal the decision to City
Council. The determination by City Council constitutes a final decision by the
city.
   (E)   Period of validity of conditional use permit.
      (1)   The approval of a conditional use permit shall become null and void
if building permits have not been issued for all buildings and structures
within 12 months after approval of a conditional use permit. The Planning
Commission may extend this time period if requested and justified by the owner
or agent. In no situation shall the Planning Commission extend this time period
for longer than two years from the date of approval of the conditional use
permit.
      (2)   If a conditional use permit expires as described in division (E)(1)
of this section, the owner or authorized agent will be required to submit a new
conditional use permit application and fee and obtain new approvals for such
use.

§ 155.047 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (A)   No structure within the designated Historic and Business “G” Zoning
District shall be constructed, or the exterior changed or altered, unless the
owners of the structure or premises first secure a certificate of
appropriateness from the Design Review Board.
   (B)   All applications for certificates of appropriateness shall be
submitted to the Safety and Service Director for this purpose.
   (C)   Upon receipt of an application for a certificate of appropriateness as
set forth herein, the Design Review Board shall meet and act upon the same
within 30 days of receipt. The Board will give the applicant notification of
their meeting date. If the proposed change is determined to be appropriate,
given environmental, architectural, historical, economic, and community
development considerations, then the Design Review Board shall issue a
certificate of appropriateness.
(Ord. 2018-06, passed 7-9-2018, § 155.128)
§ 155.048 NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Authority to continue and maintain. Passage of this code in no way
legalizes any illegal uses existing at the time of its adoption. Nonconforming
uses and structures may be as follows.
      (1)   Continuation of nonconforming use. A nonconforming use that
lawfully occupies a structure or a land site on the effective date of this code
may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
standards and limitations in this section.
      (2)   Continuation of nonconforming structure. A nonconforming structure
that lawfully occupies a lot on the effective date of this code and that does
not conform with the standards for yards, buffers, height, gross floor area of
structures, driveways, open space, or other similar regulation for the district
in which the structure is located may be used and maintained, subject to the
standards and limitations in this section.
      (3)   Continuation of nonconforming accessory uses and structures. The
continued existence of nonconforming accessory uses and structures is subject
to the provisions governing principal nonconforming uses and structures set
forth in this section.
      (4)   Maintenance, repair, and structural safety. Normal maintenance and
incidental repair may be performed on a conforming structure that contains a
nonconforming use or on a nonconforming structure.
   (B)   Nonconforming structure. A nonconforming structure may not be moved,
expanded, altered, except in the manner provided in this section or unless
required by law.
      (1)   Repair, maintenance, alterations, and expansions. A nonconforming
structure may be repaired, maintained, altered, or enlarged; provided, however,
that no such repair, maintenance, alteration, or expansion shall either create
any new nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of
all or any part of such structure without having first obtained approval of a
variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (2)   Moving. A nonconforming structure, including nonconforming signs,
may not be moved, in whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any
other location on the same lot or to any other lot unless the entire structure
conforms to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after
being moved.
   (C)   Abandonment of nonconforming use. Any nonconforming use or structure
that is abandoned or discontinued for a period of 365 consecutive days may not
be reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of the structure
or land must conform to the regulations for the district in which it is
located.
   (D)   Substitution of nonconforming use. So long as no structural
alterations are made, except as required by enforcement of other codes or
ordinances, any nonconforming use may, upon approval by the Board of Zoning
Appeals, be changed to another nonconforming use of the same classification or
of a less intensive classification, provided that the Board shall find that the
use proposed for substitution is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the
district that the existing nonconforming use is in. In permitting such change,
the Board may require that additional conditions and safeguards be met. Such
requirements shall be stipulated conditions to the approval of such change, and
failure to meet such conditions shall be considered a violation of this code.
Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a less intensive use or
becomes a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a more
intensive use or other nonconforming use.
   (E)   Expansion or substitution of nonconforming uses. The Board of Zoning
Appeals may approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove an application for
expansion or substitution of a nonconforming use. Such decision shall be based
on written findings of fact in consideration of the following standards:
      (1)   The failure of the proposed work to conform to any single factor or
standard may not necessarily be a sufficient basis for denial;
      (2)   The proposed use is consistent with the general purposes and intent
of the code;
      (3)   The proposed use promotes the safe and efficient use of land;
      (4)   The proposed use is compatible with other adjacent land uses and
buildings existing in the surrounding area;
      (5)   The proposed use is consistent with the purposes of the zoning
district in which the use is located and does not negatively impact the value
of surrounding property; and
      (6)   The proposed use would be located in a building that is specially
equipped or structurally designed for that use.
   (F)   Revocation of expansion or substitution of nonconforming use.
Violation of any condition or limitation on the grant of an approval of an
expansion or substitution of a nonconforming use is a violation of this code
and constitutes grounds for revocation of the approval.
   (G)   Reconstruction of nonconforming use and structure. Any nonconforming
building or structure which has been damaged by fire, flood, explosion,
earthquake, war, riot, or act of God, may be reconstructed and used as before
if it is done within two years after such damage. In the event that any
nonconforming building or structure is destroyed by any means, other than those
previously listed, to the extent that the estimated cost of repair is greater
than 50% of the last assessed improvement value of such structure, it shall not
be rebuilt, restored, or reoccupied for any use unless it is brought into
conformity with all regulations of this code.
(Ord. 2018-06, passed 7-9-2018, § 155.129)
§ 155.049 TEMPORARY USES AND PERMITS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals has the right to grant the temporary use of a
building or premises in any district for a purpose or use that does not conform
to the regulations prescribed by this chapter for the district in which it is
located, provided that the use is of a true temporary nature and does not
involve the erection of a permanent building or structure. The permit shall be
granted in the form of a temporary and revocable permit for not more than a 12-
month period, and may be subject to conditions as placed on the temporary use
by the Board of Zoning Appeals to safeguard the public health, safety,
convenience, and general welfare.

§ 155.050 DETERMINATION OF SIMILAR USE.
   (A)   Where there is a proposed use that is not currently listed in §
155.072 (Permitted Uses), the Safety and Service Director, may review the use
to determine the appropriate zoning district(s), if any, where the use may be
permitted. The nature, operation, and function of the use shall be analyzed in
the determination of the appropriate district(s).
   (B)   The Safety and Service Director may forward his or her decision to
Planning Commission for review and to determine if the proposed use should be
enumerated in this zoning code as a permitted use in the appropriate zoning
district(s) pursuant to §
155.042 (Zoning Text and Map Amendments).
   (C)   The Safety and Service Director may find that the proposed use is not
compatible with any existing zoning districts and not permit the use under the
current zoning code. The owner or owner’s authorized agent may appeal the
decision of the Safety and Service Director to the Planning Commission for
review and final decision.
(Ord. 2018-06, passed 7-9-2018, § 155.131)

agent aggrieved or by any agent of the city affected by such decision.

      (1)   Appeals shall be filed within 30 days of the date of the meeting or
notice in which the decision was made by filing a written notice of appeal.

Upon receipt of a notice of appeal, the Safety and Service Director shall
transmit the written notice to the applicable board or commission including all
of the papers constituting the record upon which the decision being appealed
was based.
   (C)   Public hearing. A public hearing shall be held for all appeals subject
to the requirements of §
155.041(C) (Public Notification for Public Hearing).
   (D)   Decision on appeals. The concurring vote of a majority of the members
of the applicable board or commission present at the meeting shall be necessary
to reverse or modify any decision under this zoning code. A written decision on
the application shall be provided without unreasonable delay after the close of
a hearing, and in all cases, within 30 days after the close of the hearing.

   (D)   Access and maneuverability. In order to promote adequate access and
maneuverability, the following provisions shall be followed.
      (1)   The location, width, and number of access driveways serving off-
street parking areas shall not interfere with the use of adjacent properties or
the flow of traffic on public or private rights-of-way.
      (2)   All access drives shall have travel lanes of a minimum width of ten
feet and a maximum width of 12 feet.
      (3)   With the exception of driveways serving single household dwellings
and two household dwellings, wherever more than three parking spaces are served
by a single driveway, a turnaround area shall be provided, or other provision
shall be made to permit vehicles to exit the parking lot or garage without
backing onto any street or sidewalk.
      (4)   Cross-access is encouraged between adjacent commercial properties.
   (E)   Striping and identification. Parking spaces shall be clearly outlined
with painted lines on the parking surface. The striping shall be continuously
maintained in a clear and visible manner in compliance with the approved plans.
The color of the striping shall be white, yellow, or other color as approved by
the Safety and Service Director unless required by state law (i.e., parking for
the disabled).
   (F)   Setbacks. The location of off-street parking facilities and access
drives for more than five vehicles, excluding single-family and two-family
dwellings, may be located in the required yards unless otherwise specified in
this code. In no case, however, shall the parking area or access drives be
located closer than ten feet from any right-of-way, ten feet from any
nonresidential property line, and 20 feet from any residential property line,
unless specifically approved by the Planning Commission.
   (G)   Pavement.
      (1)   Parking areas and access driveways shall be improved with asphalt
or concrete, unless otherwise authorized as provided in divisions (G)(2) and
(G)(3) of this section.
      (2)   Pavers, pervious pavement, chip-and-seal, or gravel may be used for
off-street parking areas if approved by Planning Commission.
      (3)   Residential driveways may be constructed of pavers, pervious
pavement, chip-and-seal, or gravel if approved by the Safety and Service
Director.
   (H)   Curbing. When appropriate, off-street parking lots shall be improved
with a poured concrete curb, precast concrete barrier, or other barrier to
define the limits of paved areas except at the points of entrance and exit,
unless otherwise authorized by the Safety and Service Director. Wherever a
parking lot extends to a property line, fencing, wheel stops, concrete curbs,
or other suitable barriers should be provided in order to prevent any part of a
parked vehicle from extending beyond the property line and from destroying
screening materials.
   (I)   Drainage. Off-street parking areas for more than five vehicles shall
be graded and drained so that the natural flow of surface water shall not be
changed or concentrated onto adjacent property by means other than a designated
drainage course.
   (J)   Visibility. Access of driveways for off-street parking areas shall be
located in such a way that any vehicle entering or leaving such parking area
shall be clearly visible by any pedestrian or motorist approaching the access
or driveway from a public street, private street, or alley. No object,
including parking lot lighting, signage, or landscaping shall be located in an
area that obstructs vision in the sight triangle, illustrated below:

(Ord. 2018-06, passed 7-9-2018, § 155.173)
§ 155.108 OFF-STREET PARKING AND SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Units of measure. The following rules shall apply when computing
parking spaces.
      (1)   On-street parking. On-street parking spaces shall not be counted
toward off-street parking space requirements.
      (2)   Driveway space. Entrances, exits, or driveways shall not be
computed as any part of a required parking lot or area, except in the case of
single-family and two-family dwellings where driveways may be used in
calculating the amount of off-street parking.
      (3)   Multiple uses. Unless otherwise noted or approved, off-street
parking areas serving more than one use shall provide parking in an amount
equal to the combined total of the requirements for each use.
      (4)   Area measurements.
         (a)   Unless otherwise specifically noted, all square footage-based
parking standards shall be computed on the basis of gross floor area of all
floors of a nonresidential or mixed use building.
         (b)   The areas of a nonresidential or mixed use building that are
used for storage, restrooms, loading/unloading, mechanical equipment,
stairwells, and elevator shafts may be excluded from the gross floor area
calculation.
         (c)   When a measurement of the number of required spaces results in a
fractional number, the fraction shall be rounded up to the next highest whole
number.
         (d)   Parking space requirements for a use not specifically mentioned
in this code shall be determined by using the most similar and restrictive
parking space requirements as specified by the Safety and Service Director.
   (B)   Number of off-street parking space requirements. Table 8: Off-Street
Parking Space Requirements defines the number of parking spaces required for
each use within the city.

   (C)   Appeal for reduction. The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize, on
appeal, a reduction in the number of required parking spaces if an exceptional
situation or condition exists, if alternative parking methods such as shared
parking, off-street parking, and/or bicycle parking are proposed to be used, or
if a parking plan is presented that demonstrates the number of required parking
spaces based on the size and nature of the use, hours of operation, estimated
number of patrons/customers, number of employees, availability of off-street
parking, and other similar situations.
   (D)   Approval. The Safety and Service Director may approve a reduction in
the number of parking spaces required up to 10% of the number required per
Table 8: Off-Street Parking Space Requirements.

documentation or information to substantiate the request for a reduction of the
total number of parking spaces. Shared parking may be approved if:
         (a)   A sufficient number of spaces are provided to meet the highest
demand of the participating uses;
         (b)   Evidence has been submitted by the parties operating the shared
parking facility, to the satisfaction of Planning Commission, documenting the
nature of the land uses and the times when the individual uses will be in
operation to demonstrate a lack of potential conflict between them.
         (c)   The shared parking spaces will not be located in excess of 500
feet from the uses that they are intended to serve;
         (d)   Pedestrian connectivity shall be provided between the use that
it is intended to serve and the shared parking location; and
         (e)   A shared parking agreement shall be submitted and approved by
the Safety and Service Director that documents how the shared parking agreement
shall accommodate the needs of each user. This agreement shall include
provisions, evidence of deed restrictions or other recorded covenants that
ensure that the spaces will be properly maintained during the life of the
development.
   (F)   Parking spaces for the disabled. Parking spaces required for the
disabled shall be provided in compliance with the applicable state and federal
requirements. All spaces should be located so that they provide easy access
from the closest parking spaces to the major entrances of the use for which
they are provided.
   (G)   Continuation of facilities. Off-street parking areas, that are
accessory to existing or proposed uses, shall continue to be maintained and
operational for the life of the use. Such parking areas shall not be used for
automobile sales, service, or repair of motor vehicles unless specifically
approved on a zoning permit.

signs that reduce the risk of fire, collapse, and disintegration, and by
providing for the inspection and removal of signs that have become unsafe;
      (3)   Public safety by prohibiting signs that interfere with firefighting

IMAGES/0-0-0-3013.png]
      (3)    The sign area for a sign with more than one face (multi-faced
signs) shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible
from any one point.
      (4)   When two identical sign faces are placed back-to-back, so that both
faces cannot be viewed from any one point at the same time, and when such faces
are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 24 inches apart, the
sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
      (5)   No more than two display faces shall be permitted for freestanding
and projecting signs.
      (6)   In the case of irregularly shaped three-dimensional signs, the area
of the display surface shall be measured on the plane of the largest vertical
cross section.
      (7)   Where a free-standing sign or sign structure is mounted along the
roadway that has a higher grade level as compared to the grade directly below
the free-standing sign or structure. Height of such sign or structure will be
measured from the roadway grade, to the highest point of the free-standing sign
or structure. (See illustration below.)

a public or private street.
      ( 2)    For multi-oc cupant buildings , the portion of a building that is
owned or leased by a single occupant shall be consider ed a building unit. The
building frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline of
the dividing walls defining the building unit

IMAGES/0-0-0-3015.png]
   (C)   Sign height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance
from the average natural grade at the base of the sign or support structure to
the top of the highest attached component of the sign.
   (D)   Sign setback.
      (1)   The required setbacks for a sign shall apply to all elements of the
sign including its frame and base.
      (2)   The setback of a freestanding sign shall be measured horizontally
from the edge of the sign frame to the street right-of-way line or lot line, as
applicable.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 158.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City
Council does ordain the following chapter.
(1982 Code, § 158.01) (Ord. 2011-1, passed 2-14-2011)
§ 158.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The city has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(1982 Code, § 158.02) (Ord. 2011-1, passed 2-14-2011)
§ 158.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare, and to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood-prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(1982 Code, § 158.03) (Ord. 2011-1, passed 2-14-2011)
§ 158.004 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(1982 Code, § 158.04) (Ord. 2011-1, passed 2-14-2011)
§ 158.005 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the city as identified in §
158.006, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
city.
(1982 Code, § 158.05) (Ord. 2011-1, passed 2-14-2011)
§ 158.006 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (A)   Flood Insurance Study Highland County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Highland County, Ohio and Incorporates Areas both
effective March 3, 2011;
   (B)   Other studies and/or maps may be relied upon for establishment of the
flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain, floodways,
or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard;
   (C)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the state which has been approved by the
city as required by §
158.053, Subdivisions and Large Developments; and
   (D)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the City Hall.
(1982 Code, § 158.06) (Ord. 2011-1, passed 2-14-2011)
§ 158.007 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(1982 Code, § 158.07) (Ord. 2011-1, passed 2-14-2011)
§ 158.008 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(1982 Code, § 158.08) (Ord. 2011-1, passed 2-14-2011)
§ 158.009 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(1982 Code, § 158.09) (Ord. 2011-1, passed 2-14-2011)
§ 158.010 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(1982 Code, § 158.10) (Ord. 2011-1, passed 2-14-2011)
§ 158.011 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   APPEAL. A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a

FLOOD or 100-YEAR FLOOD.
   BASE (100-YEAR) FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The water surface elevation of the
base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in feet mean sea level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the BASE
FLOOD ELEVATION is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from one
to three feet).
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation, or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ENCLOSURE BELOW THE LOWEST FLOOR. See LOWEST FLOOR.
   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT). Issued by President Carter in
1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in
or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless
there is no practicable alternative.
   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA). The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   FILL. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES.
      (1)   Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of
the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
      (2)   Following are the zone definitions.
         (a)   ZONE A. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
         (b)   ZONES A1-30 AND ZONE AE. Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
         (c)   ZONE AO. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
         (d)   ZONE AH. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
         (e)   ZONE A99. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
         (f)   ZONE B AND ZONE X (SHADED). Areas of 500-year flood; areas
subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
         (g)   ZONE C AND ZONE X (UNSHADED). Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. The base flood elevation plus two feet of
freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative
source, the FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION can be historical flood elevations, or
base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain
Administrator.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
FLOODWAY is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
The FLOODWAY is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood waters; high potential
for debris and projectile impacts; and moderate to high erosion forces.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a water shed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on the state’s inventory of historic places
maintained by the State Historic Preservation Office; or
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by city’s historic preservation program, which program is certified by the
State Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the state, in accordance with standard
engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood elevations
and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE. An official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or
revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps,
and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the following
categories:
      (1)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to human-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a “recreational vehicle”. For the purposes
of these regulations, a MANUFACTURED HOME includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 3781.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in the O.A.C. 4781-12-01(K), a
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK means any tract of land upon which three or more
manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or
for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle,
or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A
tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or
rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a MANUFACTURED HOME PARK, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The NFIP is a federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the start of construction commenced
on or after the initial effective date of the City of Hillsboro Flood Insurance
Rate Map, September 4, 1986, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   PERSON. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An AGENCY is further defined in R.C. § 111.15 as any
governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. AGENCY does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the Adjutant General’s Department, or any
court.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT. A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture under the provisions of R.C. §§ 4703.01 to 4703.19.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person registered as a professional
engineer under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a professional
surveyor under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Also known as AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD, it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in
any given year. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance
Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as
Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS may also refer
to areas that are flood-prone and designated from other federal, state, or
local sources of data, including, but not limited to, historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood-prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or

management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified.
   (A)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         (a)   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         (b)   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;

and other data showing areas of special flood hazard.
   (A)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (B)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations; and
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist, or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (D)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in §§
158.070 through
158.075, Appeals and Variances.
   (E)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, and the like) shall prevail.

   (A)   Development in floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted, provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         (a)   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
158.034(A);
         (b)   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         (c)   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         (a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible; and
         (b)   Division (A)(2)(a) and (A)(2)(c) through (A)(2)(e) of this
section.
   (C)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the bankfull stage.
The field determination of bankfull stage shall be based on methods presented
in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-245, Stream
Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or other
applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other authoritative
source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse, the following
standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished;
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency;
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
city specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit; and
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in §
158.034(A)(1)(c) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

§ 158.073 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (A)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
   (B)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold a
public hearing within 30 days after the receipt of an application for a
variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least ten days before the date of the hearing.
   (C)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (D)   Issuance of variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws;
         (d)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages; and
         (e)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (2)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (E)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in division (C)(1) through (C)(11)
of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(1982 Code, § 158.63) (Ord. 2011-1, passed 2-14-2011)
§ 158.074 PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (A)   All testimony shall be given under oath.

confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
   (C)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony in
support of the appeal or variance.
   (D)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition to
the appeal or variance.
   (E)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
   (F)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become part
of the record for appeal.

attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
   (H)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its decision.
The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and thereafter
issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a reasonable
time after the hearing.

Rainwater and Land Development developed by the Soil Conservation Service, U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
(1982 Code, § 159.22) (Res. 96-20, passed 2-3-1997)
§ 159.23 STABILIZATION OF DENUDED AREAS AND SOIL STOCKPILES.
   (A)   Permanent soil stabilization shall be installed on denuded areas
within seven days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site.
Application practices include vegetative establishment, mulching, and the early
application of gravel base on areas to be paved. Soil stabilization measures
should be selected to be appropriated for the time of year, site conditions,
and estimated time of use.
   (B)   Temporary soil stabilization shall be required on any denuded area
which will not be regraded for longer than 30 days. Temporary soil
stabilization shall be applied within seven days after rough grading.
   (C)   Soil stockpiles shall be stabilized or protected with sediment
trapping measures to prevent soil loss.
(1982 Code, § 159.23) (Res. 96-20, passed 2-3-1997)
§ 159.24 ESTABLISHMENT OF PERMANENT VEGETATION.
   A permanent vegetative cover shall be established on denuded areas not
otherwise permanently stabilized after final grading. Permanent vegetation
shall not be considered established until a ground cover is achieved which is
mature enough to control soil erosion and to survive severe weather conditions.
(1982 Code, § 159.24) (Res. 96-20, passed 2-3-1997)
§ 159.25 PROTECTION OF ADJACENT PROPERTIES.
   Properties adjacent to the site of a land disturbance shall be protected
from sediment disposition. This may be accomplished by preserving a well-
vegetated buffer strip around the lower perimeter of the land disturbance, by
installing perimeter controls such as sediment barriers, filters or dikes, or
sediment basins, or by a combination of such measures.
(1982 Code, § 159.25) (Res. 96-20, passed 2-3-1997)
§ 159.26 TIMING AND STABILIZATION OF SEDIMENT TRAPPING MEASURES.
   Sediment basins and traps, perimeter dikes, sediment barriers and other
measures intended to trap sediment on-site shall be constructed as a first step
in grading and be made functional before up slope land disturbance takes place.
Earthen structures such as dams, dikes, and diversions shall be seeded and
mulched within seven days of completion of installation.
(1982 Code, § 159.26) (Res. 96-20, passed 2-3-1997)
§ 159.27 SEDIMENT BASINS.
   (A)   Where five acres or more of the development area are disturbed in one
watershed, stormwater runoff from that watershed shall pass through a sediment
basin or other suitable sediment trapping facility with equivalent or greater
storage capacity. The city may require sediment basins or traps for smaller
disturbed areas where deemed necessary. The sediment basin requirement may also
be waived, by variance, if the city agrees that site conditions do not warrant
its construction.
   (B)   Unless otherwise designed, sediment basins are temporary and shall be
removed following final stabilization or their approved methods of
stabilization of the contributing watershed.
(1982 Code, § 159.27) (Res. 96-20, passed 2-3-1997)
§ 159.28 CUT AND FILL SLOPES.
   Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and constructed in a manner which will
minimize erosion. Consideration should be given to the length and steepness of
the slope, the soil type, up slope drainage area, groundwater conditions and
other applicable factors. Slopes which are found to be eroding excessively
during the first two years after final grade shall be provided with additional
slope stabilizing measures by the owner, developer or builder as appropriate
until the problem is corrected. The following guidelines are provided to aid in
developing an adequate design.
   (A)   Roughened soil surfaces are generally preferred to smooth surfaces on
slopes.
   (B)   Diversions should be constructed at the top of long steep slopes which
have significant drainage areas above the slope. Diversions or terraces may
also be used to reduce slope length.
   (C)   Concentrated stormwater should not be allowed to flow down cut of fill
slopes unless contained within an adequate channel, flume, or slope drain
structure.
   (D)   Wherever a slope face crosses a water seepage plane which endangers
the stability of the slope, adequate drainage or other protection should be
provided.
(1982 Code, § 159.28) (Res. 96-20, passed 2-3-1997)
§ 159.29 STABILIZATION OF WATERWAYS AND OUTLETS.
   All on-site stormwater conveyance channels except roadway ditches shall be
designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity of flow without
erosion. Methods adequate to prevent erosion shall also be provided at the
outlets of all pipes and paved channels. Provisions for management of
stormwater shall be submitted to the Safety and Service Director of the city
for review and approval.
(1982 Code, § 159.29) (Res. 96-20, passed 2-3-1997)
§ 159.30 STORM SEWER INLET PROTECTION.
   All storm sewer inlets which are made operable during construction shall be
protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter the conveyance system
without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove sediment.
(1982 Code, § 159.30) (Res. 96-20, passed 2-3-1997)
§ 159.31 WORKING IN OR CROSSING WATERCOURSES.
   (A)   Construction vehicles should be kept out of watercourses to the extent
possible. Where in-channel work is necessary, precautions shall be taken to
stabilize the work area during construction to minimize erosion. The channel
(including bed and banks) shall always be restabilized immediately after in-
channel work is completed.
   (B)   Where a live (wet) watercourse will be crossed by construction
vehicles regularly during construction, a temporary stream crossing shall be
provided.
(1982 Code, § 159.31) (Res. 96-20, passed 2-3-1997)
§ 159.32 DISPOSITION OF TEMPORARY MEASURES.
   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be disposed of
within 30 days after final site stabilization is achieved as determined by the
city or after the temporary measures are no longer needed, unless otherwise
authorized by the city. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soil areas
resulting from the disposition of temporary measures shall be permanently
stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation.
(1982 Code, § 159.32) (Res. 96-20, passed 2-3-1997)
§ 159.33 MAINTENANCE OF TEMPORARY MEASURES.
   All temporary erosion and sediment control practices shall be maintained and
repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their intended function.
The owner will be responsible for such maintenance until the final inspection
by the city.
(1982 Code, § 159.33) (Res. 96-20, passed 2-3-1997)
§ 159.34 STATUS OF STANDARDS.
   The standard are general guidelines and shall not limit the right of the
city to impose additional, more stringent requirements, nor shall the standard
limit the right of the city to waive individual requirements.
(1982 Code, § 159.34) (Res. 96-20, passed 2-3-1997)

list of materials and their cost shall be submitted to the city. Construction
cost estimates shall reflect realistic and current bid prices.
   (F)   As required improvements are completed, approved, and accepted, the
city may, reduce the amount of the security.
   (G)   When the proper administrative officials, following final inspection
of a subdivision, certify to the city that all improvements have been
constructed in accordance with city specifications as established, the city may
proceed to accept the facilities for which the security was posted.
   (H)   Whenever public improvements have not been constructed in accordance
with the agreement, and with specifications as established, the city may
exercise its right of foreclosure under the security agreement.
(1982 Code, § 159.42) (Res. 96-20, passed 2-3-1997)
§ 159.48 INSPECTION AND COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   The city may inspect development areas to determine compliance with
these rules and regulations. If it appears that a violation of these
regulations has occurred, the owner or his or her appointed representative
shall be notified of the deficiencies or noncompliance by the city in writing
by certified mail. If within two weeks after receipt of such letter, the
deficiency or noncompliance has not been corrected or plans have not been
approved by the city for its correction, said deficiency or noncompliance shall
be reported to the city for consideration.
   (B)   If the city determines that a violation exists an injunction or other
appropriate relief may be sought to abate excessive erosion or sedimentation
and secure compliance with these regulations. In granting relief, the court may
order the construction of sediment control improvements or implementation of
other control measures.
   (C)   A final inspection will upon notification by the developer of the
completion of the scope of work being performed under the sediment control plan
