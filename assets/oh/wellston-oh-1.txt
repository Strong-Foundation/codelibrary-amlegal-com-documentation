      (1)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day; except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may
be performed on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal
holiday.

      (5)   When an act is to take effect or become operative from and after a
day named, no part of that day shall be included. If priority of legal rights
depends upon the order of events on the same day, the priority shall be
determined by the times in the day at which they respectively occurred.
(R.C. § 1.15)
      (6)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from

otherwise expressly declared in the law giving the authority, or it is
inconsistent with state law or municipal charter provisions.

contains any express provision excluding the construction, or when the subject
matter or context of the law is repugnant thereto.
§ 10.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (A)   The repeal of a repealing statute does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(R.C. § 1.57)
   (B)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in division (C) of this section:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal; or
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and the
investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced,
and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the ordinance had not
been repealed or amended.
   (C)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(R.C. § 1.58)
   (D)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(R.C. § 1.54) (Rev. 2002)
§ 10.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (A)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
section or an inclusive group of sections, or of divisions or subdivisions of a
section, the reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any provision
of the section, sections, divisions or subdivisions included in the reference.
   (B)   References in the code to action taken or authorized under designated
sections of the code include, in every case, action taken or authorized under
the applicable legislative provision which is superseded by this code.
(R.C. § 1.23)
   (C)   A reference to any portion of a provision of this code applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(R.C. § 1.55)
   (D)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(R.C. § 1.56)
   (E)   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof,
the reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified or renumbered, unless the subject matter has been
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
(Rev. 2002)
§ 10.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (A)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(R.C. § 1.51)
   (B)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of the Legislative
Authority are irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment
prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of the Legislative Authority, one amendment without reference to
another, the amendments are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may
be given to each. If the amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the
latest in date of enactment prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates
language deleted by an earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted
by an earlier amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.
Amendments are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably
be put into simultaneous operation.
(R.C. § 1.52)
   (C)   In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of this code,
or between any of the provisions of this code and any standard code adopted by
the municipality pursuant to R.C. § 731.231, the provision that establishes the
higher or stricter standard shall control.
(Rev. 2002)
§ 10.07 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provisions of a section of this code or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
other provisions or applications of the section or related sections which can
be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end
the provisions are severable.
(R.C. § 1.50)
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES.
   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any
office, officer or employee of the municipality exercising the powers, duties
or functions contemplated in the provision, irrespective of any transfer of
functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered consisting of the misspelling of any
words, the omission of any words necessary to express the intention of the
provisions affected, the use of words to which no meaning can be attached, or
the use of a word when another word was clearly intended to express the
intention, the spelling shall be corrected, and the words supplied, omitted or
substituted shall conform with the manifest intention, and the provision shall
have the same effect as though the correct words were contained in the text as
originally published. No alteration shall be made or permitted if any question
exists regarding the nature or extent of the error.
§ 10.10 ORDINANCES REPEALED.
   With the exception of any ordinances specifically saved by the municipality,
this code, from and after its effective date, shall contain all of the
provisions of a general nature pertaining to the subjects herein enumerated and
embraced. All prior ordinances pertaining to the subjects treated by this code
shall be deemed repealed from and after the effective date of this code of
ordinances.
§ 10.11 ORDINANCES UNAFFECTED.
   All ordinances of a temporary or special nature, all other ordinances
pertaining to subjects not enumerated and embraced in this code of ordinances,
and all ordinances specifically saved by the municipality shall remain in full
force and effect unless herein repealed expressly or by necessary implication.
§ 10.12 ORDINANCES SAVED.
   Whenever an ordinance by its nature either authorizes or enables the
legislative body, or a certain municipal officer or employee, to make
additional ordinances or regulations for the purpose of carrying out the
intention of the ordinance, all ordinances and regulations of a similar nature
serving the purpose, effected prior to the codification and not inconsistent
thereto, shall remain in effect and are saved.
§ 10.13 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.14 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.15 AMENDMENTS TO CODE; AMENDATORY LANGUAGE.
   (A)   Any chapter, section or division amended or added to this code by
ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this code may be numbered in
accordance with the numbering system of this code and need not be inserted in
this code, but shall be treated as if printed for inclusion herein.
   (B)   The following language may be used by the municipality to amend, add
or repeal a chapter, section or division.
      (1)   To amend a section: “Section                 of the Municipal Code
of Ordinances is amended to read as follows: ....”

the text of the division or section is substantially equivalent to the
statutory provision.

   All offenses committed under laws in force prior to the effective date of
this code shall be prosecuted and remain punishable as provided by those laws.
This code does not affect any rights or liabilities accrued, penalties incurred
or proceedings begun prior to the effective date of this code. The liabilities,
proceedings and rights are continued; punishments, penalties or forfeitures
shall be enforced and imposed as if this code had not been enacted. In
particular, any agreement granting permission to utilize highway rights-of-way,
contracts entered into or franchises granted, the acceptance, establishment or

      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;

division (A) above, or by threat of such removal, destruction, mutilation,
transfer or other damage to or disposition of such record, may commence either
or both of the following in the County Court of Common Pleas:

   (E)   A civil action for injunctive relief under division (B)(1) above or a

(Ord. 4134, passed 5-10-2012) Penalty, see §

§ 34.25 PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. The city maintains many records that are used in the
administration and operation of the city. In accordance with state law, the
city’s Records Commission has adopted a schedule of records retention and
disposition that identify these records and this schedule is available in the
Mayor’s office and in each department. This schedule lists generally the types
of records that are stored on a fixed medium (paper, computer, film and the
like) that are created, received or sent under the jurisdiction on of the city
and document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures,
operations or other activities of the city. The records maintained by the city
and the ability to access them are means to provide trust between the public
and the city.
   (B)   Custodian of public records; when available. The Clerk of Council is
the official Public Records Custodian of all records which are centrally
maintained by the city. Department heads are the official custodians of all
records maintained within their departments. Public records requests may be
made directly to department heads or through the Public Records Custodian.
Requests for records from the Police Department may be made directly to the
Police Records Clerk. Public records requests will be accommodated during
regular business hours when offices maintaining said records are open for
business. Public records requests will not be accepted on weekends or holidays.
   (C)   General provisions.
      (1)   Public records.
      (2)   Missing Information. 
         (a)   Missing Information. 
         (b)   Missing Information. . . . receives a request for information to
be made available in an electronic format, such request will be forwarded to
the Public Records Custodian for a determination as to whether such information
will be generated and released in an electronic format.
         (c)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters and the like. If fewer
than 20 pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily available
in an electronic format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should
be made as quickly as the equipment allows.
         (d)   All requests for public records must either be satisfied or be
acknowledged in writing by the public office within three business days
following the office’s receipt of the request. If a request is deemed
significantly beyond “routine”, such as seeking a voluminous number of copies
or requiring extensive research, the acknowledgment must include the following:
            1.   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy
the request;
            2.   An estimated cost if copies are requested; and
            3.   Any items within the request that may be exempt from
disclosure.
      (3)   Fees and payment.
         (a)   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual
cost of making copies or printing pictures and shall also pay the actual cost
(e.g. postage) of delivery and other supplies used in mailing, delivery or
transmission of the public record. Payment for public records requests is
required prior to the actual copying or printing of records.
         (b)   The cost for copies made on letter or legal size paper is set
forth in the codified ordinances. If the Public Records Custodian uses an
outside copying service to make the copies, the requestor will be required to
pay the cost of the entire copying job, as billed by the copying service.
Copies that are requested in some format other than normal letter or legal
paper will be “at cost”, without taking into account employee time spent
preparing the copies. (For example, public records in electronic format placed
on a CD will be assessed the cost of the CD, plus the cost, if any, of creating
the electronic copies.)
         (c)   Public records will only be copied by the Public Records
Custodian or other authorized officers, employees or representatives. The
Public Records Custodian may use an outside copying service to make the copies,
at the Public Records Custodian’s discretion. Under no circumstances will the
requestor be permitted to make the copies himself or herself. The manner of
copying is at the discretion of the Public Records Custodian or the department.
Requests to copy a certain number of public records on a given page, by
“reducing” copy size or otherwise, may be met at the discretion of the Public
Records Custodian or department.
         (d)   Individual departments may adopt a policy that if fewer than ten
pages or copies are requested, no fee will be charged. All requests exceeding
ten pages will be charged a fee of $0.07 per page for all pages copied. No
receipt will be required to be issued for payments received of less than $1.
         (e)   State law may provide for specific fees to be charged for
certain records (e.g., police accident reports: $4 each, with photographs at an
additional cost, pursuant to R.C. § 5502.12).
      (4)   Denial of a public records request.
         (a)   Under certain circumstances, records are not defined as “public
records” under state law or are exempt from disclosure under federal law. In
these situations, the public record request will be denied on that basis. The
Ohio Revised Code requires that any denial be supported by legal authority. A
denial that is responding to a written public records request will also be
given in writing using form RC 101. Written reason for denial will not be
required for verbal public records requests. Any denial of public records
requested must include an explanation, including legal authority. If portions
of a record are public and portions are exempt, the exempt portions are to be
redacted and the rest released. If there are redactions, each redaction must be
accompanied by a supporting explanation, including legal authority, unless
federal or state law authorized or requires the redaction.
         (b)   The Ohio Revised Code regards certain actions as being “denials”
of public record requests. These situations are handled as follows.
            1.   Redaction.
               a.   The Ohio Revised Code defines a REDACTION as obscuring, or
deleting any information that is exempt from the duty to permit public
inspection or copying from an item that otherwise meets the definition of a
record in R.C. § 149.011. Examples of redaction are “blacking out” or “whiting
out” or “cutting out” portions of a document.
               b.   When a public record contains information that is not
within the definition of a “public record” as defined by law. or is exempt by
law, the Public Records Custodian will make available that portion of the
public record that does meet the definition of a “public record”. The Public
Records Custodian shall make a copy of the public record, perform the
redaction, lien make a copy of that sheet and make the second copy available to
the requestor. The requestor will not be charged for the first copy made. If
practical, the first copy will be retained by the Public Records Custodian.
            2.   Requests that are ambiguous, overly broad, or are difficult to
identify the public records requested. At times, a requestor may make a public
records request from which the Public Records Custodian cannot determine which
public records are being sought. In such circumstances, the Public Records
Custodian will inform the requestor that the public records request is denied,
but will give the requestor an opportunity to more accurately describe the
public records sought. If the requestor is seeking public records organized in
a certain way, but the public records are not organized in that way, the Public
Records Custodian will inform the requestor of the manner that the public
records of the office under discussion are maintained and accessed. The
requestor may then submit a public records request that more accurately
reflects the actual organization of the public records sought.
   (D)   Compliance. The Public Records Custodian reserves the right to consult
with legal counsel prior to the release of any public records. This is to allow
the city to comply with laws regarding the release of certain records.
   (E)   Failure to respond to a public records request. The city recognizes
the legal and nonlegal consequences of failure to properly respond to a public
records request. A public office’s failure to comply with a request may result
in remedies and damages according to R.C. § 149.43.
(Ord. 4134, passed 5-10-2012)
§ 34.26 MAINTAINING PUBLIC RECORDS.

all Courts Inferior to Common Pleas which were promulgated by the Supreme Court
of Ohio on December 4, 1967, and completely revised effective January 1, 1975,

chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in R.C. Title 57,
unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this chapter
that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable context
in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax and in
R.C. Title 57 and the use is not consistent, then the use of the term in the
laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall control over the
use of the term in R.C. Title 57.
   (B)   The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall include
the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   (C)   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME. For a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under (C)(24)(d) below, means a C corporation’s federal taxable income before
net operating losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal
Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
         (a)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income;
         (b)   Add an amount equal to 5% of intangible income deducted under
division (C)(1)(a) above, but excluding that portion of intangible income
directly related to the sale, exchange or other disposition of property
described in § 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code, being 26 U.S.C. § 1221;
         (c)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange or
other disposition of an asset described in §§ 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code, being 26 U.S.C. §§ 1221 or 1231;
         (d)   1.   Except as provided in (C)(1)(d)2. below, deduct income and
gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the income and gain
directly relate to the sale, exchange or other disposition of an asset
described in §§ 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code, being 26 U.S.C. §§
1221 or 1231; and
            2.   Division (C)(1)(d)1. above does not apply to the extent the
income or gain is income or gain described in §§ 1245 or 1250 of the Internal
Revenue Code, being 26 U.S.C. §§ 1245 or 1250.
         (e)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;
         (f)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;
         (g)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under R.C. § 4313.02;

(h)4. below, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017. The amount of such net operating
loss shall be deducted from net profit that is reduced by exempt income to the
extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable income to zero, with any remaining

   (A)   Individuals.
      (1)   For residents of the city, the income tax levied herein shall be on
all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation from
whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the resident’s
distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned directly or
indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This is further
detailed in the definition of income in §
39.02.
      (2)   For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident’s distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
      (3)   For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to municipal
taxable income as defined in §
39.02. Exemptions which may apply are specified in §
39.02(C)(12).
   (B)   Refundable credit for nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

3121(v)(2)(C).
            QUALIFYING LOSS. The amount of compensation attributable to a
taxpayer’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the receipt of money
and property attributable to distributions from the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of money and
property is made by the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The taxpayer
sustains a QUALIFYING LOSS only in the taxable year in which the taxpayer
receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            QUALIFYING TAX RATE. 
               a.   The applicable tax rate for the taxable year for the which
the taxpayer paid income tax to the city with respect to any portion of the
total amount of compensation, the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
               b.   If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the QUALIFYING TAX RATE is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the city each
year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            REFUNDABLE CREDIT. The amount of city income tax that was paid on
the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         (b)   If, in addition to the city, a taxpayer has paid tax to other
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation’s
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the city
for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         (d)   The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer’s qualifying loss is attributable to:
            1.   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
            2.   The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer’s terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
   (C)   Domicile.
      (1)   (a)   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the city for all

the individual’s residency:
         (g)   The primary location at which the individual is employed;
         (h)   The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual’s dependents as defined in § 1152 of the Internal Revenue Code,
being 26 U.S.C. §§ 1152, to the extent that tuition paid to such educational
institution is based on the residency of the individual or the individual’s
spouse in the municipal corporation where the educational institution is
located; and
         (i)   The number of contact periods the individual has with the city.
For the purposes of this division, an individual has one “contact period” with
the city if the individual is away overnight from the individual’s abode
located outside of the city, and while away overnight from that abode, spends
at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two consecutive days in the
city.
      (3)   All additional applicable factors are provided in the rules and
regulations.
   (D)   Businesses. This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a
business or profession in the city, unless the taxpayer is an individual who

telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under R.C.
Chapter 5745.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (D)(2) and (E) below, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the city shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the city during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used
above, TANGIBLE PERSONAL OR REAL PROPERTY shall include property rented or
leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by
multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the city to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the
same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever the
individual’s services are performed, excluding compensation from which taxes
are not required to be withheld under §
39.04(C); and
         (c)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the city
to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period
from sales, rentals and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)   If the apportionment factors described in division (D)(1)
above do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer’s business activity in
the city, the taxpayer may request, or the city’s Tax Administrator may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation; or
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
39.12(A).
         (c)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (D)(2)(a) above, but
only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by §
39.12(A).
         (d)   Nothing in division (D)(2) above nullifies or otherwise affects
any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a the Tax Administrator
or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and taxpayer before
January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (D)(1)(b) above, WAGES, SALARIES AND OTHER

inquiry, review, court-martial or similar administrative, judicial or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer; or
         (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (D)(3)(a) or (D)(3)(b) above solely in
order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax liability. If the
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator’s determination was unreasonable.

employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the city and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion; or
            3.   The property is shipped from a place within the city to
purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the taxpayer is
not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or

         (b)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
city to the extent that such services are performed in the city;

      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the city’s tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the city or if the individual
taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the city. The city shall

calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation
in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported

         (b)   An individual who is a resident of the city shall report the
individual’s net profit from all real estate activity on the individual’s
annual tax return for the city. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the

the purposes of that division or division (D)(2) above, the owner of a

recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may
change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or owner
under this division at any time.
      (2)   (a)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a
taxpayer may elect to apply the provisions of this division to the

         (b)   A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division
in writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a

assessment. The election applies to the taxable year for which that return or
appeal is filed and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer
revokes the election.
         (c)   The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the Tax
Administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the

to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be

election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (D)
(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (E)(2):
         (a)   For the purpose of division (D)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (D)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (D)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (D)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
Tax Administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (D)(2) of this section. However, a Tax Administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to division (D) above.
(Ord. 2015-082, passed 10-15-2015; Ord. 2024-23, passed 4-18-2024)
§ 39.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (A)   Each employer, agent of an employer or other payer located or doing
business in the city shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the city. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under §
39.03 or division (B)(4) or (B)(6) below, the tax shall be withheld at the rate
specified in §
39.03 of 1%. An employer, agent of an employer or other payer shall deduct and
withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent or
other payer directly, indirectly or constructively pays the qualifying wages
to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) below, an employer, agent
of an employer or other payer shall remit to the city’s Tax Administrator the
greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld or the income taxes required
to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent or other payer according to
the following schedule.
         (a)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent or other payer on
behalf of the city in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the city in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200. Payment under this division (B)(1)(a) shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the
last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) above of taxes required to be
deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of each
calendar quarter.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required to
make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes withheld
on payments to employees under § 6302 of the Internal Revenue Code, being 26
U.S.C. § 6302, 26 C.F.R. § 31.6302-1 or any other federal statute or
regulation, the payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax
Administrator of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the city. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer’s agents or other payers obligation to file any return as required
under this section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer or other payor shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and the city as the return
required of a nonresident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee’s employer, agent
of an employer or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is not required to
withhold city income; tax with respect to an individual’s disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation’s
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer’s, agent’s or other
payer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer or other payer
to remit to the city the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for
that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to a
city income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the city until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator,
listing:
         (a)   The names, addresses and Social Security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the city during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee; and
         (e)   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer or other payer does not
discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold city income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer’s employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer’s control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer’s control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card or other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.
   (C)   (1)   For the purpose of this division (C), the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
         EMPLOYER. Includes a person that is a related member to or of an
employer.
         FIXED LOCATION. A permanent place of doing business in this state,
such as an office, warehouse, storefront or similar location owned or
controlled by an employer.
         PRINCIPAL PLACE OF WORK. 
            1.   The fixed location to which an employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis, if the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location, PRINCIPAL PLACE OF WORK means the worksite location in this
state to which the employee is required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not required to report for
employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location or
worksite location, PRINCIPAL PLACE OF WORK means the location in this state at
which the employee spends the greatest number of days in a calendar year
performing services for or on behalf of the employee’s employer.
            2.   If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the “greatest number of days in a calendar year” performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee’s
qualifying wages subject to division (C)(2)(a)1. below among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee’s PRINCIPAL PLACE OF WORK with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            3.   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with
division (C)(2)(b) below, except that “location” shall be substituted for
“municipal corporation” wherever “municipal corporation” appears in that
division.

the calendar year. WORKSITE LOCATION does not include the home of an employee.
      (2)   (a)   Subject to divisions (C)(3), (C)(5), (C)(6) and (C)(7) below,
an employer is not required to withhold city income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in the city if the
employee performed such services in the city on 20 or fewer days in a calendar
year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee’s principal place of work is located in the city;
or
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the city. For the purposes of this division, PRESUMED
WORKSITE LOCATION means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
city at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can “reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days” if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days;
               c.   The employee is a resident of the city and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee’s qualifying wages as provided
in this section; or
               d.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer or public figure and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee’s capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer or public figure.
         (b)   For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) above, an employee shall
be considered to have spent a day performing services in the city only if the
employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf of the employer
in the city than in any other municipal corporation on that day. For the
purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a particular
location, the time spent performing one or more of the following activities
shall be considered to have been spent at the employee’s principal place of
work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, re-manufactured or improved by the employee’s employer;
            4.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (C)

            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee’s final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee’s
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
state municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) above shall apply only
if, with respect to the employee’s qualifying wages described in that division,
the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages to that
municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) below, if, during a
calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing personal
services in the city exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall withhold
and remit tax to the city for any subsequent days in that calendar year on
which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal services
performed in the city.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the city under
division (C)(4)(a) above may elect to withhold tax for the city for the first
20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the city.
      (5)   If an employer’s fixed location is the city and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in §
39.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee’s qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
city, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the city. To determine whether an employer qualifies as
a small employer for a taxable year, the employer will be required to provide
the Tax Administrator with the employer’s federal income tax return for the
preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (C)(4) above shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of this
section.
(Ord. 2015-082, passed 10-15-2015)
§ 39.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)   An annual Wellston city income tax return shall be completed and filed
by every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to
the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer or
other payer under this section when the nonresident individual taxpayer’s sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,
agent of an employer or other payer, and no additional tax is due to the city.
      (2)   Retirees having no municipal taxable income for city income tax
purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives municipal taxable income taxable to the city, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent’s executor,
administrator or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the city, the return or notice required of that individual shall be
completed and filed by the individual’s duly authorized agent, guardian,
conservator, fiduciary or other person charged with the care of the person or
property of that individual.
   (D)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed
and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.
   (E)   The city shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (F)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer’s Social Security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual
to include with each annual return, and amended return copies of the following
documents: all of the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service form W-2, Wage and
Tax Statements, including all information reported on the taxpayer’s federal W-
2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal corporation;
the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and, with respect to an
amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to support the
adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the
annual return required by this section electronically is not required to
provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F or form 1120S; and, with respect to
an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary to
support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return. A
taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements or
documents required by the city to determine and verify the taxpayer’s municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under this division (F) apply
regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on a form
prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each return
required to be filed under this section shall be completed and filed as
required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed for the
filing of state individual income tax returns under R.C. § 5747.08(G). The
taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by
the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with remittance made
payable to the city. No remittance is required if the net amount due is $10 or
less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the city’s income tax
return. The extended due date of the city’s income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the
extended due date of the city's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an
individual shall be the fifteenth day of the eleventh month after the last day
of the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file
under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless
the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the city’s income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-mouth
extension for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer’s city income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the city income tax return is due, the
Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer’s requested extension.
      (3)   If the Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under R.C. § 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a city’s income tax
return. The extended due date of the city’s income tax return shall be the same
as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the city, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (5)   (a)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a
municipal income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section,
the Tax Administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the
taxpayer with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the
return or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever
occurs first.
         (b)   If a Tax Administrator violates this division (G)(5) of this
section, the municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any
reasonable costs incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         (c)   Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the Tax Administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)   To the extent that any provision in this division (G) conflicts
with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P) or (Q) below, the provisions in
divisions (N), (O), (P) or (Q) below prevail.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the city shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is $10 or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the city for a taxable
year pursuant to division (H)(1) above shall file with the city an annual net
profit return under division (F)(3) below.
   (I)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under §
39.04(B)(1)(a) or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the city by an employer, the agent of an employer
or other payer as described in § 39.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as
credits against payment of the tax imposed on the taxpayer by the city, unless
the amounts withheld were not remitted to the city and the recipient colluded
with the employer, agent or other payer in connection with the failure to remit
the amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the city to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report or document required by the city, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution or rules and regulations adopted by the city
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter
and of the city’s ordinance, resolution or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports or documents.
   (M)   (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer’s net profit from a business or profession may file the city’s
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the city’s Tax Administrator for both
an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by the city during the period of the member’s or
civilian’s duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member’s or
civilian’s duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred and eighty-first day after the
applicant’s active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division are not
delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the one hundred and eighty-
first day after the applicant’s active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) above
are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
   (P)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) above.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive, both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report or other tax document and an extension of time in which
to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (F)(2)(a)
above shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that the
taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this division,
QUALIFYING TAXPAYER means a member of the national guard or a member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of the
United States or an act of the congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (F)
(2)(a) above are not delinquent during the extension period. Such taxes become
delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension period if the
taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any period of
extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) above in calculating the penalty or
interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)   For each taxable year to which division (N), (O) or (P) above applies
to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (O)(3) above, as
applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing status of the
spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
   (R)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      AFFILIATED GROUP OF CORPORATIONS. An affiliated group as defined in §
1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, being 26 U.S.C. § 1504, except that, if such
a group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is
primarily engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service
in this state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local
exchange carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. A consolidated return filed for
federal income tax purposes pursuant to § 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code,
being 26 U.S.C. § 1501.
      CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME. The consolidated taxable income of
an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the purposes of filing a
consolidated federal income tax return, before consideration of net operating
losses or special deductions. CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME does not
include income or loss of an incumbent local exchange carrier that is excluded
from the affiliated group as defined above.
      INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIER. Has the same meaning as in R.C. §
4927.01.
      LOCAL EXCHANGE TELEPHONE SERVICE. The same meaning as in R.C. § 5727.01.
   (S)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the city’s
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) below or a
taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator
shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (S)(1) above. The election to discontinue filing a
consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year period
beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (S)(1) or (S)(2) above is binding
on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a municipal
income tax.
   (T)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated city income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm’s length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the city. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated city
income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated city income tax
return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate
return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated city income tax return in the
same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (V)(3) and (V)
(4) below, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in §
39.02, by substituting “consolidated federal taxable income” for “federal
taxable income” wherever “federal taxable income” appears in that division and
by substituting “an affiliated group of corporation’s” for “a C corporation’s”
wherever “a C corporation’s” appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated city income tax return shall
make any adjustment otherwise required under §
39.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated city income tax return shall do one of the
following with respect to that pass-through entity’s net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so excluded,
the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group; or
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
this section, include the property, payroll and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so included,
the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis
of the entity’s net profits that are included in the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused
to the city; and
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to city income taxation
as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of the
entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated city income tax return shall make
the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of this section by
substituting “consolidated federal taxable income attributable to” for “net
profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in that section and by
substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for “taxpayer” wherever
“taxpayer” appears in that section.
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated city income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges
or other amounts imposed by the city in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the city before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with the city may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

§ 39.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the city who is required to and
does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (C) below, the credit shall not exceed the
tax due the city under this chapter.
   (B)   The city shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the city who works in a joint economic development zone created under R.C. §
715.691, or a joint economic development district created under R.C. §§ 715.70,
715.71 or 715.72, to the same extent that it grants a credit against its tax on
income to its residents who are employed in another municipal corporation.
   (C)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) above, “the income, qualifying
wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation” subject to tax in the
other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by dividing the tax
withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for that
municipality.

§ 39.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      ESTIMATED TAXES. The amount that the taxpayer reasonably estimates to be
the taxpayer’s tax liability for the city’s income tax for the current taxable
year.
      TAX LIABILITY. The total taxes due to the city for the taxable year,
after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and after applying
any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from another taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld for the city from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the city in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case, they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld; and
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
DATE OF THE POSTMARK means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under §
39.05(G) or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the city, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year: 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year: 45% percent of the tax liability for the taxable
year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year: 67.5% percent of the tax liability for the
taxable year; and
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year: 90% of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with R.C. § 718.05.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to §
39.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) below.
The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year: 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year: 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year: 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment; and
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year: 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) above shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by
this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the
following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due;
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the city under §
39.05 for that year; or
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the city but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.

§ 39.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
$0.50 shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part of a
dollar that is less than $0.50 shall be dropped. If a person chooses to round
amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts entered on
the document.

§ 39.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)   As used in this section, WITHHOLDING TAX has the same meaning as in §
39.18.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax levied
by the municipal corporation:
      (1)   Overpayments of $10 or more; or
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds $10 or
more.
   (C)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor’s claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) below, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose
request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment shall state the
amount of the refund that was denied the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
39.21.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) above shall be considered to have been filed in a
timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request;
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day; or
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   (1)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a
taxpayer of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the
overpayment until the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any
overpayment is refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the
annual return or 90 days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund.
      (2)   For the purpose of computing the payment of interest on amounts
overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered to have
been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is reported is
due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that return. Interest
shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
39.18(A)(4).
(Ord. 2015-082, passed 10-15-2015)
§ 39.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with the city but should have been
deposited with another municipality is allowable by the city as a refund, but
is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the city is subject to recovery by the city. If the
city’s tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund
of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the city shall allow
a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the city claims is due
with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to
the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)   If the city’s tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
city’s tax rate. However, if the city’s tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to the city, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-082, passed 10-15-2015)
§ 39.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer’s tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the city changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
city. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer’s consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those facts,
figures, computations or attachments from a previously filed return that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return only:
         (a)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations and attachments were reopened; or
         (b)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under §
39.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by §
39.12(E) for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than $10, no refund need be
paid by the city. A request filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in §
39.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations and attachments.
   (D)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s city tax liability, that taxpayer shall
make and file an amended city return showing income subject to city income tax
based upon such final determination of federal or state tax liability. The
taxpayer shall pay any additional city income tax shown due thereon or make a
claim for refund of any overpayment unless the tax or overpayment is less than
$10.

§ 39.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) above may be
extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent of
the employer, other payer or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension. Any
extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (C) below.
      (2)   As used in this section, QUALIFYING DEFERRAL PERIOD means a period
of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in §
39.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment; and
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in §
39.99.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all of the portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the city does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the state
Board of Tax Appeals or any court to which the decision of the state Board of
Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than
the amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by §
39.09, with interest on that amount as provided by §
39.09(E).
   (E)   No civil action to recover city income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following lime periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties; or
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 2015-082, passed 10-15-2015)
§ 39.13 AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer’s rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer. A
taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting an
audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer’s
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer’s ease.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest
(Ord. 2015-082, passed 10-15-2015)
§ 39.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      LAST KNOWN ADDRESS. The address the Tax Administrator has at the time a
document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the Tax
Administrator can ascertain using reasonable
means such as the use of a change of address service offered by the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      UNDELIVERABLE ADDRESS. An address to which the postal service or an
authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to deliver an
assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-delivery is
because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) below, a copy of each assessment shall be
served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703,056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056. If
the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment’s postmark.
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other city official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) above is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the
assessment is served.
      (2)   (a)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by
certified mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address,
the Tax Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The
assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and
include the following statement:
“This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date.”
         (b)   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery
of the assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
         (c)   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)
(1)(a) above. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
under this division in accordance with division (D) below.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) above bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified mail
was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person’s agent or the person’s affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person’s affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee’s business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) above, and if that assessment is subject to collection and
is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60 days after the
initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other city official, or the
designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division prevents the Tax
Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with the person
if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the Local Board of Tax
Review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator’s designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) above, including those on which a claim has been delivered
for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under this
section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the rules and regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-082, passed 10-15-2015)
§ 39.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, CLAIM means a claim for an amount payable to
the city that arises pursuant to the city’s income tax imposed in accordance
with this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim; or
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator’s rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the

by law, including: the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums
and federal and state income tax returns; to examine persons under oath; to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents and testimony; to take depositions; to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt; to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses; and to administer oaths.

the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the city’s
income tax ordinance;
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)   Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;

bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including

computations or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         (b)   If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-
determine or correct any tax finding, determination, computation or order which
the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn
by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed or is otherwise final.
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law; and/or
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in §

examine the books, papers, records and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent or employee
to investigate and examine such books, papers, records and federal and state
income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer or other

inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax

not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the city or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records and federal and state income tax returns in such person’s
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.

attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail to
comply.

to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before or
upon filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying

identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to §

(b) above may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with

39.99 for a violation of §
39.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear before the
Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law, certified

§ 51.03 BILLING PROCEDURE AND COLLECTION OF WATER RENTS AND CHARGES.
   (A)   All charges for the consumption of water and use of sewer, as fixed by
the measurement of the water meter, shall be billed monthly by the city. Each
bill shall be due and payable on or before the tenth of the month when billed
at the office of the City Clerk. If the date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, legal
holiday or other day that the City Clerk's office is closed, the due date shall
be extended to the next business day. When a bill is not paid by the due date,
a delinquent notice will be sent. This will give the customer ten days to pay
the delinquent amount or service disconnection procedures will begin. All bills
and fees must be paid in full at no time will a water customer be permitted to
carry a water balance.
   (B)   Unless otherwise specified, bills will be rendered to the tenant only,
but the property owner will be notified if a bill for water charges is
delinquent.

the property owner will be held directly responsible for the payment of all
bills pertaining to the use of water.
   (D)   All water and sewer charges and service charges shall be payable at
the office of the City Clerk. Customer must present bill with payment. The
Clerk shall be charged with the duty of receiving and collecting all water and
sewer charges and service charges and accounting therefor in the manner
prescribed by law and this chapter. The Clerk shall establish and maintain such
ledgers, books, records and all accounting systems as may be required by reason
of such collecting. When any account is delinquent and within the rules
established by the Director of Public Safety and Service, water service should
be terminated and the same shall be immediately certified by the Clerk to the
Director. Whenever requested by the Director, the Clerk shall report the
conduct of their office relating to the collection of water rents and service
charges. The Clerk's office staff may not alter bills or fees on their own
authority.
   (E)   In the event the charges for utility service (water service, sewage
service and garbage service) are not paid within 30 days after rendition of the
bill for such service, then such charges shall be deemed and are hereby
declared to be delinquent. Such a delinquency shall constitute a lien upon the
real estate for which such service is provided, and the City Auditor shall be
and is hereby authorized and directed to file sworn statements showing such
delinquencies in the office of the County Auditor. The filing of such
statements shall be deemed notice of the lien.
   (F)   For any customer with a closed account with a delinquent balance, the
city shall transfer the balance to an open account of the customer after
delivery of ten-day notice by mail to the customer to pay the closed account
balance.

§ 51.05 WATER AND SEWER SERVICE TERMINATION POLICY.
   (A)   Reasons for disconnection.
      (1)   Utility service for residential premises may be disconnected or
terminated (hereinafter “disconnection”) by the city only for the following
reasons:
         (a)   Non-payment;
         (b)   Emergencies and repairs; or
         (c)   At request of both customer and consumer of service.
      (2)   Disconnections other than at the request of both the customer and
consumer of service may not occur without proper notice.
      (3)   Disconnection includes the removal of water meter and disconnection
of private sewer line from city sewer line. Reconnection requires payment of
applicable charges in §
51.01.
   (B)   Notice procedures.
      (1)   Written notice of proposed disconnection of service, for any reason
other than voluntary disconnection as described in this section, must be
delivered by the city at least ten days, and no more than 14 days, prior to the
date proposed for disconnection. Notices may be mailed with first class postage
prepaid to reasonably assure delivery within that time. Notices shall be dated
and a copy of any notice sent shall be retained by the city in the business
file relating to the address referred to in the notice. Notices shall clearly
and conspicuously advise of each of the following facts:
         (a)   The proposed disconnection date;
         (b)   The reason for the proposed disconnection, including (if
applicable) the amount claimed to be due, the location and hours at which
payment in person can be made, and the minimum payment which, tendered at or
before disconnection, is necessary to avoid disconnection; and
         (c)   A notice that a customer of services may avoid disconnection by
paying current charges and assuming responsibility for payment of future
charges, if the customer owing the current balance does not reside in the
service address with the customer.
   (C)   Voluntary termination of service.
      (1)   Requests for voluntary disconnection of utility service shall be
made at the city utility office, shall be made in writing on a form approved by
the service representative, and shall be approved by the customer contractually
obligated to pay charges incurred at the service address, and shall also be
approved in writing by an adult person actually residing at the affected
service address, if the service address is not comprised solely of the billing
address of the customer obligated on the account.
      (2)   If the service address is different than the customer’s billing
address, or if there is reason to believe the service address may be occupied
by a household other than or in addition to the customer’s household, no
disconnection will be processed until a disconnection request form is signed by
an adult person actually residing in each service address that will be affected
by the disconnection.
      (3)   Service department employees performing such verification shall
make reasonable efforts to determine whether the service address is occupied or
unoccupied, including, but not necessarily limited to, checking with neighbors
and other utility providers. Service employees performing such verification
shall note in writing his or her identity, the date and time of the visit, and
the efforts utilized to determine the occupancy status of the premises, and his
or her conclusions as to occupancy. Such notations and all request forms
executed under the provision shall be retained in the business file kept by the
city relating to the service address so affected.
   (D)   Emergencies and repairs.
      (1)   Disconnection or termination of service may occur without prior
notice if emergency circumstances involve imminent danger to person or
property. However, prior notice shall be given even in such circumstances if it
is practicable for the city to do so. For all emergency disconnections, the
city must verify the existence of emergency circumstances as soon as possible
and must, within four hours after the disconnection, provide the customer and
an adult person residing at each service address affected by disconnection with
a written disconnection notice as described above.
      (2)   If a service address must be temporarily disconnected for the
purpose of repairs within the service address, a disconnection request must be
made in writing by the customer who is contractually obligated to pay for
service at the address. If the service address is not comprised solely by the
billing address of the customer obligated on the account, a disconnection
request for the purpose of repairs shall not be processed unless it is also
signed by an adult person residing at each service address affected by the
disconnection. A copy of such disconnection request shall be retained in the
city’s business records relating to the service address(es) so affected. The
city shall reconnect service disconnected for purpose of repair upon demand of
either the customer or of an adult person residing at the service address so
affected.
   (E)   Disconnection procedures.
      (1)   Disconnection of utility service shall not occur after 12:30 p.m.
on any day which precedes a holiday or weekend, or any other day on which all
services necessary to reconnect services are not available. All disconnections
of service shall be documented by a written service order recording the date,
time and identity of service employee effectuating disconnection, such
documentation shall be retained in the business file kept by the city relating
to the service address so affected.
      (2)   No service employee dispatched to disconnect service shall
disconnect service until he or she makes reasonable efforts to personally
contact the occupants, if any, of each service address to be affected to advise
of the disconnection and to verify the propriety of the disconnection.
Reasonable efforts shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, knocking
on the door or doors of each household at the service address, or otherwise
attempting to gain the attention of any occupants. If the service employee
makes personal contact with the occupants of the service address and then
verifies the propriety of the disconnection, the service employee shall deliver
to the occupants a turn-off notice which shall clearly and conspicuously advise
the occupant(s) of:
         (a)   The date and time of the termination;
         (b)   The reason for termination;
         (c)   If the termination is for non-payment, the amount which must be
paid, including any reconnection fee, to have service reestablished;
         (d)   The location and hours of the office at which payment can be
made to obtain reconnection; and
         (e)   The name, title, address, telephone number and hours during
which a service representative may be contacted to discuss reconnection.
      (3)   If a service employee’s efforts to make personal contact with any
occupants of the service address immediately prior to disconnection of services
are not successful, the service employee shall post the turn-off notice in a
prominent place at the entry to each service address affected by disconnection.
The service employee shall document on the service order the efforts made to
personally contact the occupants prior to disconnection and the delivery of the
turn-off notice, including the date and time such acts were performed and his
or her identity.
   (F)   Dispute procedures.
      (1)   The service representative shall be either the City Service
Director or the City Service Supervisor. The service representative shall be
empowered and required (when good cause, within the judgment of the service
representative, is shown) to compromise disputes as to service department
requirements or payment demands; and to cancel disconnection and/or order
reconnection. The service representative shall strive to secure reasonable
alternative methods of payment or reasonable security for payment in order to
preserve utility service without discrimination. The service representative
shall be familiar with and able to advise utility customers and consumers of
agencies, resources, and programs locally available to assist in the payment of
utility bills. The service representative shall preside at hearings held
pursuant to this order.
      (2)   Customers or consumers of utility service who wish to contest
refusal of service, a billing, or a proposed disconnection of utility services
(hereafter “aggrieved persons”) shall be afforded due process opportunity to
contest the city’s action or inaction. Due process shall include the right to a
face-to-face meeting with the service representative, at which the aggrieved
person may have the assistance of others; and may present documentary and/or
oral information for the service representative’s consideration. Aggrieved
persons shall be entitled to reasonable access to city business records
concerning the service address in order to prepare for the meeting, which
includes the right to obtain copies of documents found therein upon payment of
the actual cost of copying. The service representative shall make a written
decision after the meeting, which shall include the reasons for the decision. A
copy of the decision shall be delivered to the aggrieved person and a copy
retained in the business files kept by the city relating to the service address
affected by the meeting.
      (3)   The meeting shall be held within a reasonable time after a verbal
or written hearing request has been made, but will not be held so quickly as to
deny the aggrieved person an adequate opportunity to seek assistance or to
prepare for the meeting in light of the aggrieved person’s circumstances. Five
business days shall generally constitute a reasonable time. The decision shall
be delivered to the aggrieved person within a reasonable time after the
meeting.
   (G)   Non-discrimination against consumers. If disconnection is proposed due
to non-payment of service charges by a customer who does not reside in the
affected service address, an adult consumer of utility services at said address
shall have the right to avoid disconnection or obtain reconnection if the
consumer pays the amount necessary to avoid disconnection.

§ 51.06 WATER AND SEWER RATES ESTABLISHED.
   (A)   Rates established. All users of the system, including, but not limited
to, institutional and governmental users, shall be charged a monthly usage
charge for each month of the year. The following are hereby fixed as the fair,
proportional and reasonable rates for sewer service charges, based on the water
supplied to each user by the municipal waterworks system as shown by the water
meter readings for the month of January for each calendar year. If a user does
not receive water from the municipal waterworks system or otherwise lacks a
water meter, that user’s charges shall be based upon readings shown by a sewage
flow meter acceptable to the Director of Public Safety and Service. If a user
directly or indirectly discharges industrial waste into the system, and the
Director of Public Safety and Service finds it impractical to measure such
waste by meter, then such waste shall be determined in accordance with accepted
engineering practice and in conditions and attendant circumstances of the case.
The rates hereinafter set forth shall be effective on February 1, 2017.
      (1)   The minimum monthly sewer service charge shall be based upon the
rate schedule in the Fee Chart. The monthly charges shall apply to each
separate dwelling unit in a multi-unit complex, such as an apartment building,
mobile home park or condominium, whether or not separate meters are installed
for each such dwelling unit.
      (2)   Each user shall be notified at least annually, in conjunction with
a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the sewer service charge which
is attributable to OM&R costs of wastewater treatment services.
   (B)   Monthly charges. Charges for sewerage service shall be imposed each
month for the calendar year. All bills shall be rendered as of the tenth day of
the month next following the month for which charges are imposed, and shall be
due and payable on the date of rendition thereof. The sewer charges imposed
herein are gross charges. If a bill is paid within ten days after the date of
billing, a net rate, which is the gross rate less 10% thereof, shall apply.
   (C)   Per diem. Any user whose premises are connected to the system and
initially using it after the first day of any month, shall be charged at a per
diem rate from the time the use of the system begins until the beginning of the
next following month. The per diem rate shall be obtained by dividing the
monthly minimum charge by 30 days. However, if the measured service exceeds the
per diem charge, then the rate applicable to the measured service shall be
charged.
   (D)   Separate metering. If it can be shown to the satisfaction of the
Director of Public Safety and Service, with respect to any premises, that a
portion of the water from any source consumed on such premises does not and
cannot enter the system, then in each such case the owner or other interested
party may, at his or her expense, install and maintain separate metering
devices to the extent necessary to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Director the portion of the water consumed on the premises which is discharged
into the system, which portion shall constitute the basis for measuring the
sewerage service charge for such premises under this section, or the owner or
other interested party, at his or her option, may request the Director to
determine the amount of water that does not and cannot enter the system from
such premises. Such determination shall be made in accordance with accepted
engineering practices, shall be conclusive on the owner or other interested
party and shall constitute the basis for measuring the sewerage service charge.
   (E)   Surcharges. When the Director of Public Safely and Service or his or
her designee determines that either the total suspended solids or the BOD of a
water or waste accepted for admission to the system exceeds the values allowed
for normal sewage, the excess concentration in either or both, as the case may
be, shall be subject to a surcharge for each pound of excess suspended solids
per day, and for each pound of excess BOD per day. In addition, the city may
surcharge any user for the discharge of any other pollutant into the system,
but this shall not obligate the city to accept any such pollutant (see Fee
Chart).

§ 51.10 ADJUSTMENTS.
   Adjustments will only be made for the following:
   (A)   Filling of pools. The adjustments will be made to the sewer portion
only and will be as follows: we will deduct any amount over the average use of
the customer’s sewer bill only. For pools, we must have the reading of the
meter before and after it is filled.
   (B)   Water leaks.
      (1)   There is hereby established a voluntary Water Leak Insurance
Program for the benefit of the customers to be used to pay for the excess
amount of fees due to water leakage.
      (2)   The terms of the voluntary Water Leak Insurance Program are as
follows.
         (a)   Coverage is $3 per month per customer account.
         (b)   The leak insurance will cover up to and including $1,000 per
calendar year, per meter, and per customer any amount over the average monthly
bill. After this amount is reached, the customer will be responsible for the
balance of the bill.
         (c)   Insurance is valid only if the the property owner notifies the
city and shows proof of repair, and repair is made within five days of
notification.
         (d)   To figure the amount to be paid if a water leak occurs, the
customer’s bill will be averaged for the 12 months preceding. This average will
be deducted from the leak amount. The remaining balance of water and sewer will
be considered a leak, and the leak amount will be paid for through the Water
Leak Insurance Program once the repairs are finished. The sewer bill will be
adjusted according to the water bill adjustment. The amount available for
payment each calendar year is $1,000 per customer account.
         (e)   The monthly fee will be added to each monthly bill if the
customer takes the insurance (see Fee Chart). Insurance for new customers, if
they decide to participate, will begin when they apply for service. There will
be a 30-day waiting period for the insurance to be in effect.
      (3)   The Water Leak Insurance Program is only for the adjustment of the
water and sewer portion of the month in which the leak occurred. The insurance
cannot be used to fill swimming pools or any other uses not considered leaks.
The Water Leak Insurance Program does not pay for the customer’s repairs.
      (4)   Courtesy shutoffs for suspected leaks will be performed at the
discretion of the City Clerk.

§ 51.11 DORMANT WATER METERS.
   (A)   If a water meter does not have an active account for more than 30 days
because of disconnection under §
51.06 or otherwise, then the city may remove the water meter to protect its
meter and to prevent water theft.
   (B)   Upon information that the water meter is dormant, the Director of
Public Service shall cause written notice to be served on the owner. If the
owner is a nonresident whose address is known, the notice shall be sent to the
address by certified mail; if unknown, it shall be sufficient to publish such
notice once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. The notice will
specify that the water meter will be removed unless the owner applies for a
dormant account.
   (C)   The owner or any person or company interested in a property,
including, not limited to a mortgagee, may elect to keep the water meter at a
property by applying for a dormant account with the City Clerk at a cost of
$5.50 per month. A dormant account does not permit the owner, resident or
person or company interested in a property to receive water service. Water
service is not permitted until an application for account is made under §
51.03.

§ 52.07 GREASE, OIL AND SAND INTERCEPTORS.
   (A)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Water Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling
of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable
wastes, sand and other harmful ingredients, except that such interceptors shall
not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors
shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Superintendent, and shall be
located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   (B)   Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious
materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature.
They shall be of substantial construction, water-tight and equipped with easily

(2003 Code, § 52.07) (Ord. 1937, passed 8-1-1968)
§ 52.08 INDUSTRIAL PRETREATMENT AND NONACCEPTABLE WASTEWATER.
   (A)   In regard to sewage that is admissible to the sewage system only after
pretreatment, and in regard to pretreatment requirements in general, the
conditions and regulations promulgated under § 307(b) of the Clean Water Act,
being 33 U.S.C. § 1317(b) are incorporated into this section and made a part
hereof.
   (B)   An industrial user must, upon application for sewer service, present
to the city a tabulation of the chemical analysis of the wastes to be
discharged to the sewage system and the volume of such wastes, or if this is
not available, the expected waste analysis based on similar processes now in
operation.
   (C)   If the character of sewage from any industrial user is such that it
will damage the sewage system or cannot be treated satisfactorily at the
wastewater treatment plant, the city shall compel such user to dispose of such
waste and prevent it from entering the sewage system.
   (D)   If the character of sewage from any industrial user is such that the
sewage imposes an unreasonable burden upon the sewage system greater than that
imposed by the average sewage entering the system, the city may proceed in any
of the following manners:
      (1)   Compel such user to pretreat the sewage in such manner as specified
by the city before the sewage is discharged into the system;
      (2)   Require flow control or equalization of such waste so as to avoid
any “slug” loads or excessive loads that may be harmful to the treatment works;
      (3)   Require payment of a surcharge on any excessive flows or loadings
discharged to the treatment works so as to cover the additional costs of having
capacity for and treating such wastes; or
      (4)   Make a special agreement with the user for treatment or disposal of
the sewage so as to ensure that the integrity of the treatment facilities and
the receiving stream is preserved.
   (E)   The discharge of nonacceptable industrial wastewater into the sewage
system, whether directly or indirectly, is prohibited. Wastewater shall be
nonacceptable when the concentration of toxic or harmful substances in the
wastewater exceeds certain prescribed tolerable limits as specified in § 307(a)
of the Clean Water Act, being 33 U.S.C. § 1317(a), or regulations promulgated
thereunder, both of which are hereby incorporated herein. The list of
substances specified in the foregoing federal laws is subject to revisions as
required to meet current water quality standards or effluent standards imposed
by state or federal agencies. However, if the city determines that the
concentration of any such substances is such that the total pounds of such
substances discharged into the system are not harmful to or will not interfere
with the sewage treatment process or will not violate water quality standards,
then the concentrations may be exceeded.
   (F)   The city may make a special agreement with an industrial user so as to
accept for treatment an industrial waste of unusual strength or character. Any
such special agreement shall be authorized by ordinance passed for that
specific agreement.
   (G)   Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this chapter.
Facilities to prevent such accidental discharges shall be provided and
maintained at the owner’s or operator’s own cost and expense. Detailed plans
showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be
submitted to the city for review, and shall be approved by the city before
construction of any such facility. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify his or her facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter.
   (H)   If an accidental discharge facility does not comply with or will be
unable to comply with any prohibition or limitations in this chapter, the
industrial user responsible for such discharge shall immediately notify the
city so that corrective action may be taken to protect the treatment system. In
addition, the responsible industrial user shall file with the Director of
Public Safety and Service, within five days of the occurrence of the
noncomplying discharge, a written report detailing the date, time and cause of
the accidental discharge; the quantity and characteristics of the discharge;
and corrective action taken to prevent future discharges.
   (I)   The regulation of nonacceptable wastewater in this section is in
addition to, and not in lieu of, the regulation of prohibited discharges in §
52.05.

any provision of this chapter, it may serve upon such person a written notice
stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time, not to
exceed 30 days, for a satisfactory correction thereof. Such notice shall also
state that any person in violation of this chapter shall be liable for any
resulting damages or applicable fines.
   (B)   If the violation is not corrected by timely compliance, the city may
order any person who causes or allows an authorized discharge to show cause why
service should not be terminated. Proceedings on the show cause order shall be
heard by the Water and Sewer Charges Review Board established by §
51.11. A notice shall be served on the person, specifying the time and place of
a hearing to be filed by the Board regarding the violation, and directing the
person to show cause before the Board why service should not be terminated. The
notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days before the hearing. Service
may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
   (C)   The Board may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may
designate any of its members or any officer or employee of the city to:
      (1)   Issue, in the name of Board, notices of hearings requesting the
attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant
to any matter involved in any such hearings;
      (2)   Take evidence;
      (3)   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the Board for
action thereon;
      (4)   At any public hearing, testimony taken before the Board or any
person designated by it must be under oath and recorded stenographically. The
transcript will be made available to anyone making request therefor upon
payment of the usual charges therefor;
      (5)   After the Board has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to
the party responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified
time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances shall have been installed
or existing treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are
properly operated, and such further orders and directives are as necessary and
appropriate;
      (6)   Any discharge in violation of this chapter or an order of the Board
shall be considered a public nuisance. If any person discharges sewage,
industrial wastes or other wastes into the city treatment system contrary to
this chapter or any order of the Board, the Board shall commence an action for
appropriate legal and equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction;
and
      (7)   Any person found guilty by the Board of violating this chapter
shall have such right to appeal as may be available under state law.

§ 70.10 THROUGH HIGHWAYS.
   (A)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (B)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated

continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

      (2)   When any motor vehicle, including an abandoned junk motor vehicle,
as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, is left on private residential property, as
defined in R.C. § 4513.60, or on private agricultural property, for at least

injured or arrested operator;
      (8)   When any vehicle has been operated by any person who has failed to

violations of this traffic code have been issued and the owner or operator
thereof has failed to respond to the citation tags as lawfully required.

shall be ordered into storage and/or disposed of as provided under R.C. §§
4513.60 et seq. Any other vehicle removed under authority of this section shall
be ordered into storage and the Police Department shall forthwith notify the
registered vehicle owner of the fact of the removal and impounding, reasons
therefor and the place of storage. Any person desiring to redeem an impounded
vehicle shall appear at the Police Department to furnish satisfactory evidence
of identity and ownership or right to possession. Prior to issuance of a
release form, the claimant, owner or operator shall either pay the amount due
for any fines for violations on account of which the vehicle was impounded or,
as the court may require, post a bond in an amount set by the court, to appear
to answer to the violations. The pound operator shall release the vehicle upon
the receipt of the release form and payment of all towage and storage charges.
   (C)   No owner or operator shall remove an impounded vehicle from the place
of storage without complying with the above procedure. Possession of a vehicle
which has been impounded and unlawfully taken from the place of storage, by the
owner or operator, shall constitute prima facie evidence that it was so removed
by the owner or operator.

§ 70.31 SIGNAL LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (A)   Steady green signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
is permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         (a)   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         (b)   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   (a)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of- way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (B)   Steady yellow signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)
(3) of this section.
         (b)   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (D)   Flashing green signal indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (E)   Flashing yellow signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of- way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of- way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (H)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (B)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (D)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (E)   A steady red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

   (A)   The driver of a vehicle who approaches an intersection where traffic
is controlled by traffic control signals shall do all of the following if the
signal facing the driver exhibits no colored lights or colored lighted arrows,
exhibits a combination of such lights or arrows that fails to clearly indicate
the assignment of right-of-way, or, if the vehicle is a bicycle or an electric
bicycle, the signals are otherwise malfunctioning due to the failure of a
vehicle detector to detect the presence of the bicycle or electric bicycle:
      (1)   Stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, stop before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, stop
before entering the intersection;
      (2)   Yield the right-of-way to all vehicles in the intersection or
approaching on an intersecting road, if the vehicles will constitute an
immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across or within the

§ 70.34 PEDESTRIAN-CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions.
   (A)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (B)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (C)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

safety course described in division (B)(2)(a) of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (B) of this section.
      (3)    If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code

license or permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to
any other penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or non resident operating privileges for
the period of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of
suspension imposed for the violation of the provision of this code shall not

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed

or about the person’s person shall be prima facie evidence of the person’s not
having obtained a driver’s license.

has been suspended pursuant to R.C. §§ 2151.354, 2151.87, 2935.27, 3123.58,
4301.99, 4510.032, 4510.22, or 4510.33, or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (2)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a non-
certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (B)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (B)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (B)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (B)(1) of this section is guilty of
driving under suspension and shall be punished as provided in division (B)(3)
(a) or division (B)(3)(b) of this section.

to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
         (b)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (B)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (B)
(1) of this section, R.C. §§ 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree, and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to R.C. § 2929.28 in
an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss arising from an accident
or collision that was the direct and proximate result of the offender’s
operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing the offense for
which the offender is sentenced under this section.

misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to a
minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days
of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J)) (Rev. 2012)
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

   (A)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under R.C. §§
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

driver’s license issued under R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under R.C. §§
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road

vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be in
the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s or
commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (B)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a non-
certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

130.99 or R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §
130.99(E) or R.C. § 2929.26; notwithstanding §
130.99(G)(1)(b)1. and R.C. § 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up to
$1,000; and, notwithstanding §
130.99(F)(1)(c) and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (D)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.
   (E)   If the offender is sentenced under division (C)(2) of this section, if

pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was
expired for more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may
impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial
driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or
nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)
(7).

court instead imposes a sentence of not less than 30 consecutive days of house
arrest with electronic monitoring. A period of house arrest with electronic
monitoring imposed under this division shall not exceed six months. If the
court imposes a mandatory three-day jail term under this division, the court
may impose a jail term in addition to that term, provided that in no case shall
the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense exceed six months;
         (b)   A fine of not less than $250 and not more than $1,000;
         (c)   A license suspension under division (E) of this section;

sentence the offender to a longer jail term of not more than one year. The 10-
day mandatory jail term shall be imposed unless, subject to division (C) of
this section, the court instead imposes a sentence of not less than 90
consecutive days of house arrest with electronic monitoring. The period of

of the offender’s vehicle. The order of criminal forfeiture shall be issued and
enforced in accordance with R.C. § 4503.234. If title to a motor vehicle that
is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture under this division is assigned
or transferred and R.C. § 4503.234(B)(2) or (B)(3) applies, the court may fine
the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the
National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds from any fine so imposed
shall be distributed in accordance with R.C. § 4503.234(C)(2).
   (C)   (1)   No court shall impose an alternative sentence of house arrest
with electronic monitoring under division (B)(1) or (B)(2) of this section
unless, within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender
will not be able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following
the date of sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that
period.

   (E)   In addition to or independent of all other penalties provided by law
or ordinance, the trial judge of any court of record or the mayor of a mayor’s

violation of this section a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s
or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege
from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(7).
      (1)   When permitted as specified in R.C. § 4510.021, if the court grants
limited driving privileges during a suspension imposed under this section, the
privileges shall be granted on the additional condition that the offender must
display restricted license plates, issued under R.C. § 4503.231, on the vehicle
driven subject to the privileges, except as provided in R.C. § 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver’s license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
R.C. § 3123.58 or R.C. § 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from
holding a commercial driver’s license under R.C. § 4506.16 shall be issued a
driver’s license under R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the
commercial driver’s license was suspended under this section, and no person

      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left

offered by a head start agency who may have alighted therefrom has reached a
place of safety on the child’s or person’s residence side of the road.
   (F)   (1)   Whoever violates division (A) of this section may be fined an

elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (B)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action
that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.
Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         (a)   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         (b)   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         (c)   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by

and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall not be required to pay the fine and shall not have the points assessed
against that offender's driver's license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (A) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a
dismissal of the charges for the violation, and the violation is a prior
offense under divisions (D)(1)(b) and (D)(1)(c) of this section if the offender
commits a subsequent violation or violations of division (A) of this section
within two years of the offense for which the course was completed. This
division does not apply with respect to any offender in the category of
offenders to whom division (D)(1)(b), (D)(1)(c), or (D)(1)(d) of this section

be assessed for a violation of division (A) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (E)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (F)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall

   (D)   (1)   (a)   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding
for a violation of division (A)(1)(a) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine
withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in R.C. §
2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) or
(B) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under R.C.
§ 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician- paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (D)(1)(b) shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         (c)   As used in division (D)(1)(b) of this section, EMERGENCY MEDICAL
TECHNICIAN-INTERMEDIATE and EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN-PARAMEDIC have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)
(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (D)(1)(b) of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under § 73.02, shall state that the person may
have an independent test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or
inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude
the admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   (a)   As used in division (D)(4)(b) and (D)(4)(c) of this section,
NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. §
105.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (A) or (B) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:

evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the
testimony or evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the
trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
         (c)   Division (D)(4)(b) of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
   (E)   (1)   Subject to division (E)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (A)(1)(b),
(A)(1)(c), (A)(1)(d), (A)(1)(e), (A)(1)(f), (A)(1)(g), (A)(1)(h), (A)(1)(i), or
(A)(1)(j) or (B)(1), (B)(2), (B)(3), or (B)(4) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions,
a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the

         (d)   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

      (3)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to § 130.99
(G) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss
arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate result
of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing
the violation of division (B) of this section.
      (4)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to §
130.99(G) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic
loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate
result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after
committing the violation of division (B) of this section.
   (I)   (1)   No court shall sentence an offender to an alcohol treatment
program under this section unless the treatment program complies with the
minimum standards for alcohol treatment programs adopted under R.C. Chapter
5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
      (2)   An offender who stays in a drivers’ intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an
offender who stays in an alcohol treatment program under an order issued under
this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s Indigent Drivers’ Alcohol
Treatment Fund.
   (J)   If a person whose driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended under this section or R.C. §
4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of the person’s trial or sentence,
the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.
   (K)   Division (A)(1)(j) of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the amount

prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
      (2)   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled substance
in accordance with the health professional’s directions.

same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (M)   All terms defined in R.C. § 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in R.C. § 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of the
same term as defined in R.C. § 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term as defined in R.C.
§ 4510.01 applies to this section.

         ALCOHOL MONITORING DEVICE. Means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any

given consent to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine if

      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (A)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control

      (4)   Any person who is dead or unconscious, or who otherwise is in a

      (5)   (a)   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (d),
or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (C) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (A)(3) and (A)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         (b)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (A)(5)(a) of this section, the law enforcement
officer who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A)) (Rev. 2016)
   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the arresting
law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this section to
any person under arrest for a violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance. The officer shall
give that advice in a written form that contains the information described in
division (C) of this section and shall read the advice to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest
and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or more persons shall
witness the arresting officer’s reading of the form, and the witnesses shall
certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the
chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer,
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does
not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to
submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form
to the person:
You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state law or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state OVI, and, if
you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken at
your own expense.
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it
to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the
arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is
not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
person submits to the test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting officer
shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (C) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (E)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who
is asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests
under this section, and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance that the test results indicate is present in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (G)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197 relative to any
suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the
report.
(R.C. § 4511.192) (Rev. 2024)

license or permit or nonresident operating privilege under this section for the
time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) is effective immediately from the
time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension upon the
arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the
charge that resulted in the person’s being requested to take the chemical test
or tests under division (A) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §
73.03 or R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
regardless of whether the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. §
4511.191(B) or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the
charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons’
arrest or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any
continuance granted by the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the
issues specified in that section.

   (C)   (1)   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of this section, if a law enforcement officer has administered a
field sobriety test to the person in physical control of the vehicle involved
in the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally acceptable field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect what were set by the

trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not limit or preclude a court,
in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (C)(1) of this section.
   (D)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of having physical control of
a vehicle while under the influence, a misdemeanor of the first degree. In
addition to other sanctions imposed, the court may impose on the offender a
class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s

section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
   (I)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

§ 74.059 WEIGHING OF VEHICLE; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD.
   (A)   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle and its load is unlawful may require the driver of the vehicle to stop
and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self- contained,
portable, sealed scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
vehicles on highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel
loads of highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed
location, having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the
combined load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a
highway vehicle; or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded
or unloaded.
   (B)   The driver of the vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed
to the nearest available sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided the
scales are within three miles of the point where the vehicle is stopped.
   (C)   Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the
police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section.
   (D)   All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and its
load shall be annually compared by a municipal, county or state sealer with the
state standards or standards approved by the state, and the scales shall not be
sealed if they do not conform to the state standards or standards approved by
the state.
   (E)   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and
width to insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on a level terrain of sufficient length and
width to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be
level, or if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in
elevation between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-quarter
inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   (F)   In all determinations of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, 12 feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the
outside wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use
of compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   (G)   Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that
the weight is unlawful, he or she may require the driver to stop the vehicle in
a suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed
as is necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted
under R.C. §§ 5577.01 through 5577.14 and this chapter.

or electric bicycle operator who violates any provisions of this title
described in division (A) of this section that is applicable to bicycles or
electric bicycles may be issued a ticket, citation, or summons by a law

Revised Code to the contrary, may require the bicycle operator, electric
bicycle operator, or motor vehicle operator to take and successfully complete a

§ 95.01 IMPOUNDING MOTOR VEHICLE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY; REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected, may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (A)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (B) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle
only in accordance with division (D) of this section.
      (4)   As used in this section, PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY means private
property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a home,
residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three
separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The phrase
does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (B)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been
ordered into storage pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section arrives after
the motor vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual
removal from the property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator
oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (C)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders
into storage pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section. The record shall
include an entry for each such motor vehicle that identifies the motor
vehicle’s license number, make, model, and color, the location from which it
was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (A)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
   (D)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both of
the following:
         (a)   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 or, if the vehicle
was towed within a municipal corporation that has established fees for vehicle
removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         (b)   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
R.C. § 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under division
(D)(1)(b) of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (A)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         (a)   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         (b)   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
      (4)   For purposes of division (D)(3) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (5)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
division (A)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for 30 days, the
procedures established by R.C. §§ 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (E)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor
vehicle from any private residential or private agricultural property other
than in accordance with division (A)(1) of this section or R.C. §§ 4513.61 to
4513.65.
      (2)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with the
requirements of this section.
   (F)   This section does not apply to any private residential or private
agricultural property that is established as a private tow-away zone in
accordance with division (H) of this section or R.C. § 4513.601.
   (G)   Whoever violates division (E) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.60) (Rev. 2024)
   (H)   Private tow-away zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         (a)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
            2.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.
If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
            3.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times,

            4.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
            5.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may

            6.   In order to comply with the requirements of division (H)(1)(a)
of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
         (b)   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this
division (H) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that

private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.
            2.   It is well-lighted.
            3.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly
scheduled route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public

      (2)   (a)   If a vehicle is parked on private property that is
established as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (H)(1) of
this section, without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the
private property may cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The
towing service shall remove the vehicle in accordance with this division (H).
The vehicle owner and the operator of the vehicle are considered to have
consented to the removal and storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the
applicable fees established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25, and to the right of a towing service to obtain title to
the vehicle if it remains unclaimed as provided in R.C. § 4505.101. The owner
or lienholder of a vehicle that has been removed under this division (H),
subject to division (H)(3) of this section, may recover the vehicle in
accordance with division (H)(7) of this section.
         (b)   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to division (H)(2) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
         (c)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (H)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
      (4)   (a)   Prior to towing a vehicle under division (H)(2) of this
section, a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many
photographs as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on
private property in violation of a private tow-away zone established under
division (H)(1) of this section. The towing service shall record the time and
date of the photographs taken under this division (H). The towing service shall

printed form, for at least 30 days after the date on which the vehicle is
recovered by the owner or lienholder or at least two years after the date on

         (b)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under division
(H)(2) of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more
than two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone,
unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two
hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is
not within the power of the towing service.
      (5)   (a)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with division (H)(1) of this section causes

items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.

§ 130.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) below, a person is not guilty of an
offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) above does not apply to offenses defined in R.C.
Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) above does not relieve the prosecution of the
burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      CULPABILITY. Means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence, as
defined in R.C. § 2901.22.
      INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from
the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Means reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      POSSESSION. Means a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(2003 Code, § 130.07) (R.C. § 2901.21) (Rev. 2016)
§ 130.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(2003 Code, § 130.08) (R.C. § 2901.22) (Rev. 2016)
§ 130.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. The term does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(2003 Code, § 130.09) (R.C. § 2901.23) (Rev. 2013)
§ 130.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C. §
2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(2003 Code, § 130.10) (R.C. § 2901.24) (Rev. 1999)
§ 130.11 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder or an offense for which
the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first degree,
to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a drug abuse
offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number of unit
doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is an
offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if that
drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number of
unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range of
controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.

Statutory reference:
Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
Solid and hazardous wastes, see R.C. Chapter 3734
§ 130.12 COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of R.C. § 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(2003 Code, § 130.12) (R.C. § 2923.03) (Rev. 1999)
Statutory reference:
Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
§ 130.13 PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE; PROOF OF OFFENSE; AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.
   (A)   Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of
the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the
evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof by a preponderance
of the evidence, for an affirmative defense other than self-defense, defense of
another, or defense of the accused’s residence presented as described in
division (B)(1) of this section, is upon the accused.
   (B)   (1)   A person is allowed to act in self-defense, defense of another,
or defense of that person’s residence. If, at the trial of a person who is
accused of an offense that involved the person’s use of force against another,
there is evidence presented that tends to support that the accused person used
the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person’s
residence, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another, or
defense of that person’s residence, as the case may be.
      (2)   Subject to division (B)(3) of this section, a person is presumed to
have acted in self- defense or defense of another when using defensive force
that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if
the person against whom the defensive force is used is in the process of
unlawfully and without privilege to do so entering, or has unlawfully and
without privilege to do so entered, the residence or vehicle occupied by the
person using the defensive force.
      (3)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section does
not apply if either of the following is true:
         (a)   The person against whom the defensive force is used has a right
to be in, or is a lawful resident of, the residence or vehicle.
         (b)   The person who uses the defensive force uses it while in a
residence or vehicle and the person is unlawfully, and without privilege to be,
in that residence or vehicle.
      (4)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section is a
rebuttable presumption and may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence,
provided that the prosecution’s burden of proof remains proof beyond a
reasonable doubt as described in divisions (A) and (B)(1) of this section.
   (C)   As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, the court shall
read the definitions of “reasonable doubt” and “proof beyond a reasonable
doubt”, contained in division (E) of this section.
   (D)   As used in this section:
      AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. An affirmative defense is either of the following:
         (a)   A defense expressly designated as affirmative;
         (b)   A defense involving an excuse or justification peculiarly within
the knowledge of the accused, on which the accused can fairly be required to
adduce supporting evidence.
      DWELLING. Means a building or conveyance of any kind that has a roof over
it and that is designed to be occupied by people lodging in the building or
conveyance at night, regardless of whether the building or conveyance is
temporary or permanent or is mobile or immobile. As used in this division, a
building or conveyance includes but is not limited to an attached porch, and a
building or conveyance with a roof over it includes but is not limited to a
tent.
      RESIDENCE. Means a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily
or permanently or is visiting as a guest.
      VEHICLE. Means a conveyance of any kind, whether or not motorized, that
is designed to transport people or property.
   (E)   “Reasonable doubt” is present when the jurors, after they have
carefully considered and compared all the evidence, cannot say they are firmly
convinced of the truth of the charge. It is a doubt based on reasonable and
common sense. Reasonable doubt is not mere possible doubt, because everything
relating to human affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some
possible or imaginary doubt. “Proof beyond a reasonable doubt” is proof of such
character that an ordinary person would be willing to rely and act upon it in
the most important of the person's own affairs.
(2003 Code, § 130.13) (R.C. § 2901.05) (Rev. 2022)
§ 130.14 BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME.
   (A)   The municipality hereby declares that it recognizes both of the
following, in relation to the “battered woman syndrome”: that the syndrome
currently is a matter of commonly accepted scientific knowledge, and that the
subject matter and details of the syndrome are not within the general
understanding or experience of a person who is a member of the general populace
and are not within the field of common knowledge.
   (B)   If a person is charged with an offense involving the use of force
against another and the person, as a defense to the offense charged, raises the
affirmative defense of self defense, the person may introduce expert testimony
of the “battered woman syndrome” and expert testimony that the person suffered
from that syndrome as evidence to establish the requisite belief of an imminent
danger of death or great bodily harm that is necessary, as an element of the
affirmative defense, to justify the person’s use of force in question. The
introduction of any expert testimony under this division shall be in accordance
with the Ohio Rules of Evidence.
(2003 Code, § 130.14) (R.C. § 2901.06)
§ 130.15 DELINQUENCY ADJUDICATIONS DEEMED CONVICTIONS.
   (A)   If a person is alleged to have committed an offense and if the person
previously has been adjudicated a delinquent child or juvenile traffic offender
for a violation of a law or ordinance, except as provided in division (B)
below, the adjudication as a delinquent child or as a juvenile traffic offender
is a conviction for a violation of the law for purposes of determining the
offense with which the person should be charged and, if the person is convicted
of or pleads guilty to an offense, the sentence to be imposed upon the person
relative to the conviction or guilty plea.
   (B)   A previous adjudication of a person as a delinquent child or juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of a law or ordinance is not a conviction for
a violation of the law or ordinance for purposes of determining any of the
following:
      (1)   Whether the person is a repeat violent offender, as defined in R.C.
§ 2929.01, or whether the person should be sentenced as a repeat violent
offender under R.C. § 2929.14(B)(2) and R.C. § 2941.149;
      (2)    Whether the person is a violent career criminal as defined in R.C.
§ 2923.132, whether the person has committed unlawful use of a weapon by a
violent career criminal in violation of R.C. § 2923.132 or should be sentenced
for that offense under that section, or whether the person should be sentenced
under R.C. § 2929.14(K) as a violent career criminal who had a firearm on or
about the person’s person or under the person’s control while committing a
violent felony offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to facilitate the
offense.
(2003 Code, § 130.15) (R.C. § 2901.08) (Rev. 2017)
§ 130.16 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (A)   A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this municipality,
any element of which takes place in this municipality;
      (2)   While in this municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this municipality and the
other jurisdiction, or, while in this municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under
both the laws of this municipality and the other jurisdiction, and a
substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this
municipality by the person or another person involved in the conspiracy,
subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality for the attempt, complicity or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality;
      (4)   While out of this municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this municipality;
      (5)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this municipality;
      (6)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another person and subsequently brings the other person into this
municipality;
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer

   (B)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (A)(1) above includes
the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes death, the death
itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense in question. If
any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this municipality, the
death is presumed to have occurred within this municipality.
   (C)   (1)   This municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest
shore of the Ohio River extending to the opposite shore line, between the
extended boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each of
those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio River with
any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any
court of Kentucky or of West Virginia that borders on the Ohio River and that
has jurisdiction on the Ohio River under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.
   (D)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
municipality for purposes of this section.
   (E)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this municipality.
   (F)   Any act, conduct or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (G)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in or affecting this
municipality.
   (H)   For purposes of division (A)(2) above, an overt act is substantial
when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of the actor
that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (I)   As used in this section, COMPUTER, COMPUTER SYSTEM, COMPUTER NETWORK,

sender, if known, or deposited in the Inmates’ Industrial and Entertainment
Fund of the institution if the sender is not known.
         (f)   1.   Any mobile instrumentality forfeited under R.C. Chapter
2981 may be given to the law enforcement agency that initially seized the
mobile instrumentality for use in performing its duties, if the agency wants
the mobile instrumentality. The agency shall take the mobile instrumentality
subject to any security interest or lien on the mobile instrumentality.
            2.   Vehicles and vehicle parts forfeited under R.C. §§ 4549.61 to
4549.63 may be given to a law enforcement agency for use in performing its
duties. Those parts may be incorporated into any other official vehicle. Parts
that do not bear vehicle identification numbers or derivatives of them may be
sold or disposed of as provided by rules of the Director of Public Safety.
Parts from which a vehicle identification number or derivative of it has been
removed, defaced, covered, altered or destroyed and that are not suitable for
police work or incorporation into an official vehicle shall be destroyed and
sold as junk or scrap.
         (g)   Computers, computer networks, computer systems and computer
software suitable for police work may be given to a law enforcement agency for
that purpose or disposed of under division (B)(2) below.
         (h)   Money seized in connection with a violation of R.C. §§ 2905.32,
2907.21 or 2907.22 shall be deposited in the Victims of Human Trafficking Fund
created by R.C. § 5101.87.
      (2)   Unclaimed or forfeited property that is not described in division
(B)(1) above or division (A)(1)(b) above, with court approval, may be used by
the law enforcement agency in possession of it. If it is not used by the
agency, it may be sold without appraisal at a public auction to the highest
bidder for cash or disposed of in another manner that the court considers
proper.
      (3)   Except as provided in divisions (B)(1) above and (B)(5) below and
after compliance with division (B)(4) below when applicable, any moneys
acquired from the sale of property disposed of pursuant to this section shall
be placed in the General Revenue Fund of the state, or the General Fund of the
municipality.
      (4)   If the property was in the possession of the Police Department in
relation to a delinquent child proceeding in a juvenile court, 10% of any
moneys acquired from the sale of property disposed of under this section shall
be applied to one or more community addiction services providers, as defined in
R.C. § 5119.01. A juvenile court shall not specify a services provider, except
as provided in this division, unless the services provider is in the same
county as the court or in a contiguous county. If no services provider is
located in any of those counties, the juvenile court may specify a services
provider anywhere in Ohio. The remaining 90% of the proceeds or cash shall be
applied as provided in division (B)(3) above.
      (5)   (a)   If the Board of County Commissioners recognizes a citizens’
reward program under R.C. § 9.92, the Board shall notify the Police Department
of the recognition by filing a copy of its resolution conferring that
recognition with the Police Department. When the Board recognizes a citizens’
reward program and the county includes a part, but not all, of the territory of
the municipality, the Board shall so notify the Police Department of the
recognition of the citizens’ reward program only if the county contains the
highest percentage of the municipality’s population.
         (b)   Upon being so notified, the Police Department shall pay 25% of
any forfeited proceeds or cash derived from each sale of property disposed of
pursuant to this section to the citizens’ reward program for use exclusively to
pay rewards. No part of the funds may be used to pay expenses associated with
the program. If a citizens’ reward program that operates in more than one
county or in another state in addition to this state receives funds under this
section, the funds shall be used to pay rewards only for tips and information
to law enforcement agencies concerning offenses committed in the county from
which the funds were received.
      (6)   Any property forfeited under R.C. Chapter 2981 not be used to pay
any fine imposed upon a person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an
underlying criminal offense or a different offense arising out of the same
facts and circumstances.
      (7)   Any moneys acquired from the sale of personal effects, tools or
other property seized because the personal effects, tools or other property
were used in the commission of a violation of R.C. §§ 2905.32, 2907.21 or
2907.22 or derived from the proceeds of the commission of a violation of R.C.
§§ 2905.32, 2907.21 or 2907.22 and disposed of pursuant to this division (B)
shall be placed in the Victims of Human Trafficking Fund created by R.C. §
5101.87.
(R.C. § 2981.12) (Rev. 2016)
   (C)   Disposition of contraband, proceeds or instrumentalities. Except as
otherwise provided in R.C. § 2981.13, property ordered forfeited as contraband,
proceeds or an instrumentality pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2981 shall be disposed
of, used or sold pursuant to division (B) above or R.C. § 2981.12. If the
property is to be sold under division (B) above or R.C. § 2981.12, the
prosecutor shall cause notice of the proposed sale to be given in accordance
with law.

§ 130.18 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (A)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by R.C.
§§ 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B) or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Ohio
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of §
130.99 or
133.99 of this code or R.C. §§ 2929.23 through 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under §
130.99(C) through (G). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (B)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         (a)   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         (b)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         (c)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         (d)   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         (e)   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)(b) and
(B)(1)(c) above;
         (f)   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         (g)   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (B)(1) above, the court may consider any
other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and principles of
sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
   (C)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
130.99(D), (E), (F), and (G). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
130.99(C) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (D)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 through 2743.72.
(2003 Code, § 130.18) (R.C. § 2929.22) (Rev. 2024)
§ 130.19 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) below, R.C. § 2929.14(C) or R.C. §
2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term or sentence of imprisonment shall
be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail term or sentence of
imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, this state, another state
or the United States. Except as provided in division (B)(2) below, a jail term
or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor shall be served concurrently with a
prison term or sentence of imprisonment for felony served in a state or federal
correctional institution.
   (B)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. §§ 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21 or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving
the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state
correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and
prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies
under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive
terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony
before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

§ 130.20 JAIL EXPENSES; REIMBURSEMENT FOR JAIL EXPENSES.
   (A)   Use of county jail. Each person who is convicted of an offense for
violating a provision of the Wellston Codified Ordinances other than a minor
misdemeanor, and who is required to be confined in jail, shall be confined at
the Jackson County Jail at the city's expense. The expenses of confinement
shall be established by contract between the city and the Board of County
Commissioners of Jackson County. The amounts paid by the city for jail expenses
shall be based upon the actual costs of confinement.
   (B)   Reimbursement required. As permitted by R.C. § 753.02(B), every person
who is convicted of an offense for violating a provision of the Wellston
Codified Ordinances other than a minor misdemeanor, and who is confined in the
Jackson County Jail, shall reimburse the city for its expenses incurred by
reason of his or her confinement, including, but not limited to, the expenses
relating to the provision of food, clothing and shelter. The amount of
reimbursement shall be determined by a court at a hearing held pursuant to R.C.
§ 2929.15.
   (C)   Collection of reimbursement. The attorney for the city is authorized
to institute appropriate civil actions in the name of the municipal
corporation, in the court of Common Pleas of Jackson County, to recover from
convicts the reimbursement for the expenses of confinement in the County Jail,
as determined by a court pursuant to R.C. § 2929.15. More than one defendant
may be joined in one suit for collection.
(2003 Code, § 130.21) (Ord. 2655, passed 6-20-1985)
§ 130.21 APPREHENSION, DETENTION, OR ARREST OF PERSONS ON BOND.
   (A)   No person, other than a law enforcement officer, shall apprehend,
detain or arrest a principal on bond, wherever issued, unless that person meets
all of the following criteria:
      (1)   The person is any of the following:
         (a)   Qualified, licensed and appointed as a surety bail bond agent
under R.C. §§ 3905.83 through 3905.95;
         (b)   Licensed as a surety bail bond agent by the state where the bond
was written;
         (c)   Licensed as a private investigator under R.C. Chapter 4749;
         (d)   Licensed as a private investigator by the state where the bond
was written;
         (e)   An off-duty peace officer, as defined in R.C. § 2921.51.
      (2)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining or arresting the
principal, has entered into a written contract with the surety or with a
licensed surety bail bond agent appointed by the surety, which contract sets
forth the name of the principal who is to be apprehended, detained or arrested.
For purposes of this division (A)(2), SURETY has the same meaning as in R.C. §
3905.83.
      (3)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining or arresting the
principal, has notified the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction
over the area in which such activities will be performed and has provided any
form or identification or other information requested by the law enforcement
agency.
   (B)   No person shall represent the person’s self to be a bail enforcement
agent or bounty hunter, or claim any similar title, in this municipality.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of illegal bail bond agent
practices.
      (1)   A violation of division (A) above is a misdemeanor of the first
degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty
to two or more violations of division (A) above, or any substantially
equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be prosecuted under
appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (B) above is a misdemeanor of the first
degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty
to two or more violations of division (B) above, or any substantially
equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be prosecuted under
appropriate state law.
(2003 Code, § 130.22) (R.C. § 2927.27) (Rev. 2001)
§ 130.22 SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (C)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09) (Rev. 2022)
§ 130.99 PENALTY FOR TITLE XIII.
   (A)   Generally. Except where otherwise specifically classified within the
body of the section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section
shall be deemed a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more
than $500, imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) above shall be reasonably calculated to
achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set forth in
division (B)(1) above, commensurate with and not demeaning to the seriousness
of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim, and consistent with
sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) above
shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender or
religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) above shall not apply to any offense
that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court pursuant to
Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any provision of the
Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is disposed of without a
court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) through (B)(3) above do not affect any
penalties established by the municipality for a violation of its ordinances
that are not substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor
violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21) (Rev. 2005)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
130.18 or
133.99 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
division (C) may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
division (E)(2) below. The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C) and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this division (C),
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. § 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §§ 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56 or 2947.19 and
R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. above and does not pay the bill by the times specified in R.C. §
2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment against the
person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. above.
      (5)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. §§ 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(5)(a)2. below, an additional definite
jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. §§ 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(5)(a) above, the court may directly impose on the offender a
sanction that requires the offender to wear a real- time processing, continual
tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time specified by
the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal the duration
of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon the offender
under division (C)(5)(a) above. A sanction imposed under this division shall
commence on the date specified by the court, provided that the sanction shall
not commence until after the offender has served the jail term imposed for the
misdemeanor violation of R.C. §§ 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) below for any
jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24) (Rev. 2012)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §§
130.18 and
133.99 of this code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F) or (G) below. The
court may impose any other conditions of release under a community control
sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a jail term
upon the offender, the court may impose any community control sanction or
combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) above from the range of
jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all or a
portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F) or (G) below.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. above, the court shall state the duration of the community control
sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the conditions
of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any of the
following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) above;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F) or (G) below, but the court is not required to impose any
particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) above.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
above, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the
period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F) or (G) below, the court shall place the offender under the
general control and supervision of the court or of a department of probation in
the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting to the court a
violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If the offender
resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has been
established to serve the municipal court or county court in that jurisdiction,
the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the county court to
receive the offender into the general control and supervision of that
department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing court a
violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The sentencing
court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for the duration
of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F) or (G) below, and the offender
violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private person
or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that comprises
the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing court or to
the department of probation or probation officer with general control and
supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or entity
reports the violation to the department of probation or probation officer, the
department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (D)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) above;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) above, the total time spent in jail for the misdemeanor
offense and the violation of a condition of the community control sanction
shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for which the
sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the longer period
of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer sanction or the
more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) above by all or part
of the time the violator successfully spent under the sanction that was
initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F) or (G) below in an exemplary
manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community control
sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction. Fulfilling
the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the offender of
a duty to make restitution under division (G) below.
(R.C. § 2929.25) (Rev. 2024)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) above shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other cases,
the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction under
this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) above be applied to
any financial sanction imposed under division (G) below.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) above, at the time of reception and at other times the person
in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction determines to
be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house,
community alternative sentencing center, district community alternative
sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender to be
examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including but
not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, and other contagious diseases. The person
in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) above.
(R.C. § 2929.26) (Rev. 2015)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         (c)   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor
of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third or
fourth degree;
         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         (f)   A term of basic probation supervision;
         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) above, the offender may request that the court modify the
sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable contribution, as
determined by the court, to the general fund of the county, municipality or
other local entity that provides funding to the court. The court may grant the
request if the offender demonstrates a change in circumstances from the date
the court imposes the sentence or that the modification would otherwise be in
the interests of justice. If the court grants the request, the offender shall
make a reasonable contribution to the court, and the Clerk of the Court shall
deposit that contribution into the general fund of the county, municipality or
other local entity that provides funding to the court. If more than one entity
provides funding to the court, the Clerk shall deposit a percentage of the
reasonable contribution equal to the percentage of funding the entity provides
to the court in that entity’s general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1)
above, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor
misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory jail
term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the offender
or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) above.
(R.C. § 2929.27) (Rev. 2012)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G). If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include but are not limited to the
following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1.
above and division (G)(1)(b)2. below payable to the appropriate entity as
required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including but not limited to the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including but not limited to a per diem fee for room and
board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of repairing
property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. above
shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able to pay
and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may collect
any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) above in lieu
of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court does not
determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term of
community service under division (F)(1) above in lieu of or in addition to
imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in addition to
imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a minor
misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4) above in lieu of or in addition to
imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to imposing
court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court costs, the
court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction or court
costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) above to pay the costs incurred by a
county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F) or (G) above or
in operating a facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a sanction
imposed under division (E) above to the County Treasurer. The County Treasurer
shall deposit the reimbursements in the county’s General Fund. The county shall
use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs incurred by the county
pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F) or (G) above or in
operating a facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed
under division (E) above.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) above to pay the costs incurred by a municipal
corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F) or (G)
above or in operating a facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a
sanction imposed under division (E) above to the treasurer of the municipal
corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the municipal
corporation’s General Fund. The municipal corporation shall use the amounts
deposited in the fund to pay the costs incurred by the municipal corporation
pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F) or (G) above or in
operating a facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed
under division (E) above.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) above for the costs incurred by a private provider pursuant
to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F) or (G) above to the provider.
      (4)   (a)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (G)(4)(b)
and (G)(4)(c) of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         (b)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         (c)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) above is a judgment in favor
of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that imposed
the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is
the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c)1.a. above upon an offender is a judgment in favor of the
entity administering the community control sanction, and the offender subject
to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of
reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.b. above upon an offender
confined in a jail or other residential facility is a judgment in favor of the
entity operating the jail or other residential facility, and the offender
subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction
of restitution imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(a) above is an order in
favor of the victim of the offender’s criminal act that can be collected
through a certificate of judgment as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. above,
through execution as described in division (G)(5)(b)2. above or through an
order as described in division (G)(5)(b)3. above and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(5) above for the
collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 through 307.92.
         (b)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
      (10)   If an offender is sentenced to pay restitution, a fine, fee, or
incarceration costs, the clerk of the sentencing court, on request, shall make
the offender's payment history available to the victim, victim's
representative, victim's attorney, if applicable, the prosecutor, the probation
department, and the court without cost.
(R.C. § 2929.28) (Rev. 2024)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;
         (e)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $1,000;
         (f)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. § 2913.31 or 2913.43 involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a
series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts
to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations
of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service
member or spouse of an active duty service member, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. The value of
the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §
2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more than one
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant

single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active

offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2) or
(B)(3) above, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense
in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender,
within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or violations
of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same employment,
capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (B)(1) or (B)(3)
above, or committed one or more theft offenses that involve a common course of
conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as
described in division (B)(2) above. While it is not necessary to separately
allege and prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single
offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) above, it remains necessary in
prosecuting them as a single offense to prove the aggregate value of the
property or services in order to meet the requisite statutory offense level
sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) above, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing such
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (C)(2) above, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, FAIR MARKET
VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

division, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal
setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide
those services.
   (H)   No disclosure of information pursuant to this section gives rise to

accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis of the
alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further written
request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the
measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.001 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The city has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 4057, passed 10-10-2009)
§ 151.002 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 4057, passed 10-10-2009)
§ 151.003 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities:
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. 4057, passed 10-10-2009)
§ 151.004 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the city as identified in §
151.005, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
city.
(Ord. 4057, passed 10-10-2009)
§ 151.005 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (A)   Flood Insurance Study Jackson County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Jackson County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both
effective December 18, 2009;
   (B)   Other studies and/or maps which may be relied upon for establishment
of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain,
floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard;
   (C)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the state which has been approved by the
city, as required by §
151.047; and
   (D)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the 203 East Broadway Wellston, Ohio.
(Ord. 4057, passed 10-10-2009)
§ 151.006 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement, but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 4057, passed 10-10-2009)
§ 151.007 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 4057, passed 10-10-2009)
§ 151.008 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 4057, passed 10-10-2009)
§ 151.009 DEFINITIONS.

level) on all sides.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human made change to improved or unimproved real estate
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ENCLOSURE BELOW THE LOWEST FLOOR. See LOWEST FLOOR.
   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT). Issued by President Carter in
1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in
or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless
there is no practicable alternative.
   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA). The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   FILL. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Usually the initial map produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
The following are the zone definitions.
      ZONE A. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base
flood elevations are not determined.
      ZONES A1-30 and ZONE AE. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-
year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      ZONE AH. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood,
flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      ZONE AO. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood, with
flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
      ZONE A99. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      ZONE B and ZONE X (SHADED). Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the
100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with contributing
drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
      ZONE C and ZONE X (UNSHADED). Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on flood boundary and floodway maps) and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE). The base flood elevation plus one foot of
freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative
source, the FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION can be historical flood elevations or
base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain
Administrator.
   FLOODWAY. 
      (1)   The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
FLOODWAY is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
      (2)   The FLOODWAY is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood waters;
high potential for debris and projectile impacts; and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on the state’s inventory of historic places
maintained by the state’s Historic Preservation Office; or
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by city’s historic preservation program, which program is certified by the
state’s Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the state, in accordance with standard
engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood elevations
and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories.
      CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A formal review and comment
by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum National
Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend
or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps
or flood insurance studies.
      LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data that,
usually due to human made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a “recreational vehicle”. For the purposes
of these regulations, a MANUFACTURED HOME includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 3733.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in the O.A.C. § 3701-27-01, a
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK means any tract of land upon which three or more
manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for
revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle or
enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A
tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or
rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a MANUFACTURED HOME PARK, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). A federal program enabling property
owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection against
losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide an insurance
alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing
damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods. Participation in the
NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities and the federal
government that states if a community will adopt and enforce floodplain
management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all development in
special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make flood insurance
available within the community as a financial protection against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the start of construction commenced
on or after the initial effective date of the City of Wellston Flood Insurance
Rate Map, February 1, 1994, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   PERSON. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in R.C. § 111.15 as any
governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district or state community college. Agency does not include the General
Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General’s Department or any
court.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is built on a single chassis, 400
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection,
designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck,
and designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT. A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture under the provisions of R.C. §§ 4703.01 to 4703.19.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person registered as a professional
engineer under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a professional
surveyor under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA or AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the
floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood insurance studies, flood boundary
and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30
and A99. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS may also refer to areas that are flood
prone and designated from other federal, state or local sources of data
including, but not limited to, historical flood information reflecting high
water marks, previous flood inundation areas and flood prone soils associated
with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual START means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the

and other data showing areas of special flood hazard.
   (A)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state or other source.
   (B)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps and/or flood insurance
study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the
preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously existing
flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these
regulations; and
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (D)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in §§
151.065 through
151.070.
   (E)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations,
as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks and the like, shall prevail.

§ 151.053 ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized.
   (A)   Development in floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation.
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         (a)   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
151.029(A);
         (b)   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations, and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         (c)   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         (d)   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         (e)   Concurrence of the Mayor and the Chief Executive Officer of any
other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (B)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated, causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation,
may be permitted, provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         (a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible; and
         (b)   Section
151.053(A)(2)(a) and (c) through (e).
   (C)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage”. The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a federal, state or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply.
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior to
any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
city specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.

(Ord. 4057, passed 10-10-2009)
§ 151.068 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (A)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner or agent thereof of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who, upon receipt of the variance, shall transmit it
to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: name, address and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
   (B)   Public hearing. At such hearing, the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (C)   Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws;
         (d)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages; and
         (e)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (2)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (D)   Other conditions tor variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in divisions (B)(1) to (B)(11)
above have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 4057, passed 10-10-2009)
§ 151.069 PROCEDURE AT HEARING.
   (A)   All testimony shall be given under oath.

(2003 Code, § 152.02) (Ord. 1868, passed 9-15-1966)
§ 152.03 MODIFICATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   The general principles of design and the minimum requirements for the
laying out of subdivisions stipulated in §§
152.30 through
152.36 may be varied by the Planning Commission in the case of a subdivision
large enough to constitute a more or less self-contained neighborhood to be
developed in accordance with a comprehensive plan safeguarded by appropriate
restrictions, which in the judgment of the Planning Commission make adequate
provision for all essential community requirements. However, no modification
shall be granted by the Planning Commission which would conflict with the

and Other Open Public Grounds or with other features of the Master Plan, or
with the intent and purpose of the general principles of design and minimum
requirements.
   (B)   In the case of a subdivision of small size and minor importance,

   (C)   A proposed division of a parcel of land along an existing public
street, not involving the opening, widening or extension of any street or road,
and involving no more than five lots after the original tract has been
completely subdivided, may be submitted to the Planning Commission for approval
without plat, and if the Commission, acting through the Director of Public
Safety and Service, is satisfied that such proposed division is not contrary to
applicable platting, subdividing or zoning regulations, it shall within seven
working days after submission approve such proposed division and, on
presentation of a conveyance of the parcel, shall stamp the same “Approved by
City Planning Commission, Wellston, Ohio; no plat required” and have it signed
by its Clerk, Secretary or other official as may be designated by it. In so
doing, the Commission may require the submission of a sketch and such other
information as is pertinent to its determination hereunder.
   (D)   In any particular case where the subdivider can show that, by reason
of exceptional topographic or other physical conditions, strict compliance with
any requirement of these subdivision regulations would cause practical
difficulty or exceptional and undue hardship, the Planning Commission may relax
such requirement to the extent deemed just and proper, so as to relieve such
difficulty or hardship, provided such relief may be granted without detriment
to the public good and without impairing the intent and purpose of these
regulations or the desirable general development of the neighborhood and the
community in accordance with the Master Plan and the zoning ordinance. Any
modification thus granted shall be entered in the minutes of the Planning
Commission setting forth the reasons which, in the opinion of the Planning
Commission, justified the modification.
(2003 Code, § 152.03) (Ord. 1868, passed 9-15-1966)
PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL
§ 152.15 TENTATIVE APPROVAL REQUIRED PRIOR TO TRANSFER OR CONSTRUCTION WORK.
   (A)   No person, firm or corporation proposing to make or have made a
subdivision within the territorial limits of this chapter shall enter into any
contract for the sale of, or shall offer to sell such subdivision or any part
thereof, or shall proceed with any construction work on the proposed
subdivision, including grading, until he, she or it has obtained from the
Planning Commission the tentative approval of the preliminary plat of the
proposed subdivision. Before so doing, it is suggested that the subdivider or
his or her engineer consult with the authorized representative of the Planning
Commission while the plat is in sketch form, to ascertain the location of
proposed highways, primary or secondary thoroughfares, parkways, parks,
playgrounds and other planned developments.
   (B)   In planning and developing a subdivision, the subdivider or his or her
agent shall comply with the general principles of design and minimum
requirements for the layout of subdivisions set forth in §§
152.30 through
152.36 and with the rules and regulations concerning required improvements set
forth in §§
152.50 through
152.63, and in every case shall pursue the following procedure:
      (1)   The subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat of the proposed
subdivision which shall conform with the requirements set forth in §
152.16, and shall file with the Planning Commission an application in writing
for the tentative approval of the plat accompanied by five black line or blue
line prints, at least two weeks prior to a regularly scheduled meeting of the
Planning Commission;
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall check the preliminary plat as to its
conformity with the Plan of Major Streets, Schools and Parks, said other
adopted parts of the Master Plan, and the principles, standards and
requirements hereinafter set forth. Copies of the preliminary plat shall be
referred by the Commission for recommendations or other action to the Director
of Public Safety and Service for checking of matters within his or her
jurisdiction and approval of the construction plans of improvements proposed to
be installed;
      (3)   Upon receipt of the recommendations and advice of action concerning
matters covered in division (B)(2) above, the Planning Commission shall
tentatively approve or disapprove the preliminary plat, or approve it with
modifications, noting thereon any changes that will be required. One copy shall
be returned to the subdivider with the date of the tentative approval or
disapproval endorsed thereon. Similar copies will also be transmitted to the
Director of Public Safety and Service. The tentative approval of the
preliminary plat by the Planning Commission is to be considered only as an
approval of the layout with the understanding that the Director of Public
Safety and Service, or other officials having jurisdiction, may modify any
engineering or construction details proposed by the subdivider, whenever
required for the protection of the public interest;
      (4)   Upon tentative approval, which is effective for two years unless
extended by the Planning Commission, the subdivider may secure from the
appropriate authorities the necessary permits and complete construction of the
improvements; or in lieu of this may post with the Planning Commission a surety
bond subject to the requirements of §
152.50(B). Any extension of the time for completion of construction of
improvements shall be conditioned on the posting of an additional bond to cover
the term of the extension;
      (5)   Upon completion of construction of all improvements required by
this chapter, or upon the posting of the surety bond securing the construction,
the subdivider shall file with the Planning Commission the final or record plat
of the subdivision for final approval, as set forth in division (B)(6) below.
The final or record plat of a portion of a larger subdivision, the preliminary
plat of which has been tentatively approved by the Planning Commission, may be
submitted for approval;
      (6)   The subdivider shall file with the Planning Commission five blue
prints, and also one transparent copy, of durable material (tracing cloth or
acceptable substitute), from which direct process prints can be made of the
final or record plat, these to be accompanied by a certification of title
showing the ownership of all lands to be dedicated to the public and that the
title thereof is free and unencumbered;
      (7)   The Planning Commission will transmit a print and the transparent
copy of the final or record plat to the Director of Public Safety and Service
for the purpose of checking, if found satisfactory, the transparent copy will
be returned by the Director to the Planning Commission, together with a two-
fold certificate showing that the technical details of the plat itself have
been checked and found satisfactory, and all required improvements have been
satisfactorily completed;
      (8)   After a copy of the final plat together with the foregoing two-fold
certificate has been received by the Planning Commission from the Director of
Public Safety and Service, and provided that the final plat is found to conform
with the preliminary plat as tentatively approved, the Planning Commission
shall approve the final plat and will enter such approval thereon in writing by
its Chairperson and Secretary. The approval of the final or record plat by the
Planning Commission shall not be deemed to constitute or effect an acceptance
by the public of the dedication of any street or other proposed public way or
space shown on the plat. If final plat approval is requested upon the posting
of the surety bond securing construction of improvements, and prior to
completion of construction of improvements, then any such final plat shall have
endorsed thereon, the following: “This approval shall not act as an acceptance
of any public street dedication appearing hereon, nor shall this approval
relieve any subdivider of any obligation to construct improvements on any real
estate described hereon”; and
      (9)   The Planning Commission then will transmit four prints of the final
plat, along with the transparent copy and certificate of title, to Council for
action on any proposed dedication. Then Council shall return three approved
copies and the approved transparent copy of the final plat to the Planning
Commission for transmittal to the subdivider and the Director of Public Safety
and Service.

      (10)   Zoning boundary lines if any; proposed uses of property and
proposed front yard setback or other setback lines;
      (11)   All parcels of land intended to be dedicated or temporarily

of such reservation indicated;
      (12)   The total acreage of the subdivision;

location and at the width indicated on the plan; and
      (2)   Where a proposed park or other recreational area, school site or
other public ground shown in the adopted Master Plan is located in whole or in
part within the proposed subdivision, such proposed public ground or part, if
not dedicated to the city or Board of Education or Park Board, shall be
reserved for acquisition by the city or Board of Education or Park Board within
a period of five years from the date of final approval of the final plat by the
Planning Commission, by purchase or other means.
   (C)   Where held appropriate by the Planning Commission, open spaces
suitably located and of adequate size for parks, playgrounds or other
recreation purposes for local or neighborhood use shall be provided for in the
proposed subdivision and, if not dedicated to the city, shall be reserved for

(2003 Code, § 152.30) (Ord. 1868, passed 9-15-1966)
§ 152.31 STREET AND BLOCK LAYOUT.
   (A)   The street layout of the subdivision shall be in general conformity
with a plan for the most advantageous development of adjoining areas and the
entire neighborhood.
      (1)   Where appropriate to the design, proposed streets shall be
continuous and in alignment with existing, planned or platted streets with
which they are to connect.
      (2)   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions or unless, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, such extension
is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the
subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future
development of adjacent tracts. Dead-end streets of reasonable length, normally
not over 600 feet, will be approved where necessitated by topography or where,
in the opinion of the Planning Commission, they are appropriate for the type of
development contemplated.
      (3)   Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right
angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit.
      (4)   Wherever there exists, adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, a
dedicated or platted and recorded half-width street or alley, the other half
width of such street or alley shall be platted.
      (5)   Alleys shall be platted in all commercial and industrial areas if
no other provisions are made for adequate access to parking and loading spaces.
To provide safe access to residential lots fronting on thoroughfares, major
streets and highways, alleys shall be platted in the rear of such lots or
service drives provided in front thereof. Alleys will not be approved in other
locations in residence districts, unless required by unusual topography or
other exceptional conditions.
      (6)   Temporary dead-end streets shall be permitted where necessitated by
the design of the subdivision, provided, that temporary turn-arounds shall be
constructed where lots are fronting on such temporary dead-end streets. The
extra width therefor shall be the same as required for permanent turn- arounds,
provided that such extra width in excess of the street right-of-way shall be
vacated upon extension of the temporary street.
   (B)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of
appropriate depth.
      (1)   The lengths of blocks shall be such as, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission, are appropriate for the locality and the type of
development contemplated, but shall not exceed 1,800 feet where the average
size of lots does not exceed two acres in area.
      (2)   In any block over 900 feet in length, the Planning Commission may
require that a crosswalk or pedestrian way, not less than ten feet wide, be
provided near the center and entirely across such block.
      (3)   The number of intersecting streets along the highways,
thoroughfares and parkways shall be held to a minimum. Wherever practicable,
blocks along such traffic ways shall be not less than 1,200 feet in length.

the subdivider’s expense, shall be as follows:
   (A)   Primary and secondary thoroughfares, collector streets, shown as such
on the official Thoroughfare Plan, local streets and minor streets over 600
feet long: 27 feet. In the case of a primary or secondary thoroughfare, and in
the case of local street or collector street, usually requiring pavements wider
than 27 feet, the matter of financial and other arrangements for installing
such wider pavements at the time the subdivider will make the improvement shall
be taken up with the subdivider by the official having jurisdiction;
   (B)   Minor and dead-end streets not over 600 feet long: 20 feet. The
pavement of a turning circle at the dead-end street shall have a minimum
outside diameter of 60 feet. A “T” or “Y”shaped paved space, when approved by
the Planning Commission in place of a turning circle, shall extend entirely
across the width of the street right-of-way and shall be at least ten feet wide

narrow lots.
   (C)   Every lot shall abut on a publicly dedicated street.
   (D)   Lots for residence purposes shall be at least 50 feet wide at the
building setback line, in order to permit compliance with the side yard
requirements of the zoning ordinance and still be adequate for a building of
practicable width.
   (E)   Double frontage lots and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided.
   (F)   Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles to the right-of-
way line of the street on which the lot faces.

   (A)   The Planning and Zoning Board shall have the power to authorize, upon
appeal in specific cases, as hereinafter provided, such variances from the
provisions or requirements of this chapter as will not be contrary to the
public interest. Such variances shall be granted only in cases of exceptional
conditions, involving irregular, narrow, shallow or steep lots, or other
exceptional physical conditions of the land, whereby strict application of such
requirements would result in practical difficulty and unnecessary hardship that
would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land and buildings
involved.
   (B)   No variance from strict application of any provision of this chapter
shall be granted by the Board unless it finds that all the following facts and
conditions exist:
      (1)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions generally created by the
provisions of the planning and zoning code in the neighborhood or district in
which the property is located;
      (2)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of the planning and zoning code and that the authorization of a
variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
      (3)   That such necessary hardship has not been created by the applicant;
      (4)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public health, safety and/or
welfare; and
      (5)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.

   (A)   The extension of a nonconforming building on the lot occupied by such
building, or onto an adjacent lot if such lot is owned by the same person or
persons, may be permitted on a once-only basis by the Planning and Zoning
Board, provided that: such extension is necessary and incidental to such
existing nonconforming use; that the extension will not increase the ground
floor area of the building by more than 25%, and that such extension will not
extend the building more than 25 feet in any direction from the existing
building outline.
   (B)   No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole or in
part to any other location unless such building or structure and the yard and
other open spaces provided are made to conform to all of the regulations of the
district in which such building or structure is to be located.
   (C)   Any residential structure which is nonconforming due to the fact of
its being in a nonresidential zoning district may be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed or structurally altered, provided it meets the requirements of
the adjacent or most proximate R District.

§ 153.162 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district where dwellings are permitted, a one-family detached
dwelling may be erected on any lot of official record on the effective date of
this chapter, even though such lot does not comply with the lot area and width
requirements of the district in which it is located, provided said lot has a
minimum of 25 feet frontage on a public right-of-way; and further provided the
following conditions are complied with.
   (A)   If the owner of such lot does not own adjacent property and did not
own such property at the time this chapter became effective, two inches may be
deducted from the required minimum width of each side yard and four inches from
the required sum of minimum widths of both side yards for each foot that the
lot is narrower than the required width for the district. In no case, however,
shall any side yard be narrower than three feet.
   (B)   If the owner of such lot owns two or more adjacent lots, or other
adjacent property, such owner shall redivide the property in such a manner that
they conform to the minimum width of such lots in the most proximate single-

STANDARD ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS
§ 153.175 REGULATION OF THE USE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LAND OR STRUCTURES.
   Regulations pertaining to the use of land and/or structures, and the
physical development thereof, within each of the zoning districts as
established in §§
153.190 through
153.193 are hereby established and adopted.
(2003 Code, § 153.175) (Ord. 3459, § 12.01, passed 3-7-2002)
§ 153.176 RULES OF APPLICATION.
   (A)   Identification of uses. Listed uses are to be defined by their
customary name or identification, except as specifically defined or limited in
this chapter.
   (B)   Permitted uses.
      (1)   Only a use designated as permitted shall be allowed as a matter of
right in any zoning district, and any use not so designated shall be prohibited
unless:
         (a)   A permitted use may be added to a zoning district by formal
amendment, in conformance with §§
153.035 through
153.043; and
         (b)   An unlisted use may be determined by the Planning and Zoning
Board to be a similar use, in accordance with division (E) below.
      (2)   No more than one permitted use shall exist on any one zoning lot.
   (C)   Accessory uses. An accessory use or structure is a subordinate use or
structure clearly incidental and secondary to the principal permitted building
or use, and located on the same lot with such principal building or use.
Accessory uses or structures shall be allowed in accordance with the specific
district regulations, and the requirements of §§
153.390 through
153.395.
   (D)   Conditional uses. A use designated as a conditional use shall be
allowed in the zoning district where the designation occurs, when such use, its
location, extent and method of development will not substantially alter the
character of the vicinity, or unduly interfere with or adversely impact the use
of adjacent lots. To this end, the Planning and Zoning Board shall, in addition
to the development standards for the specific district, set forth additional
requirements as will render the conditional use compatible with existing and
future use of adjacent lots in the vicinity, in accordance with §§
153.120 through
153.126.
   (E)   Similar uses. 
      (1)   Determination as to whether a use is similar to uses permitted by
right shall be considered as an expansion of use regulations of the district
and not as a variance applying to a particular situation. Any use found similar
shall thereafter be considered as a permitted use in that district.
      (2)   Applications for zoning permits for uses not specifically listed in
the permitted building or use classifications of the zoning district, which the
applicant feels qualify as a similar use under the provisions of this section,
shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Board.
      (3)   Within 30 days after such submittal, the Planning and Zoning Board
shall determine whether the requested use is similar to those uses permitted in
the specific district. In order to find that a use is similar, the Planning and
Zoning Board shall find that all of the following conditions exist:
         (a)   Such use is not listed as a permitted or conditional use in
another zoning district;
         (b)   Such use conforms to basic characteristics of the classification
to which it is to be added and is more appropriate to it than to any other
classification; and
         (c)   Such use creates no increased danger to health and safety,
creates no increased level of noise, vibration, dust, heat, smoke, odor, glare
or other objectionable influences, and does not create traffic congestion to an
extent greater than normally resulting from uses listed in the classification
to which it is to be added.
   (F)   Development standards. Development standards set forth shall be the
minimum allowed for uses permitted in that district. If development standards
are in conflict with requirements of any other lawfully adopted rule,
regulation or law, the most restrictive standard shall govern.
   (G)   Development plan. 
      (1)   For particular uses in specific districts, a development plan will
be cited as required. In such cases, the development plan shall be submitted by
the applicant at the time of the application for a zoning permit, or at such
time when the property is rezoned into that district. The development plan
shall contain a site plan for the property, drawn to approximate scale, showing
all property lines, existing buildings, access drives, parking areas and other
notable physical features. The development plan shall also show the location,
outlines and size of all proposed structures including the design of all
improvements, including drainage, private streets, water and sanitary sewer
lines, as well as the size, design, materials and location of all signage
proposed for the development. The development plan shall also contain a
narrative description of the proposed use, and an evaluation of how such use
may impact adjacent property.
      (2)   The development plan shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning
Board and must be approved as a condition for the issuance of a zoning permit.
In reviewing such plan, the Planning and Zoning Board may seek the timely input
from specific consultants. In approving a development plan, the Planning and
Zoning Board shall find that the following criteria have been met:
         (a)   The proposed building or use shall have sufficient yard space to
provide for adequate parking and screening of adjacent residential areas as may
be required in this chapter;
         (b)   The proposed use and structures, as proposed, can be adequately
and efficiently served by public streets and utilities; and
         (c)   The location, design and operation of the proposed use shall not
impose undue adverse impacts on surrounding residential neighborhoods, and/or
the development plan for the proposed facility has incorporated measures to
lessen and/or alleviate such adverse impacts and protect the character of such
adjacent residential areas.
   (H)   Essential services. Essential services, as defined and specified in §
153.005, shall be permitted in any and all zoning districts within the
municipality.

§ 153.192 INTERPRETATION OF ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Except where referenced and noted on the official Zoning Map by a designated
line and/or dimensions, the district boundary lines are intended to follow
property lines, lot lines, centerlines of streets, alleys, streams and/or
railroads as they existed at the time of passage of this chapter. The Zoning
Inspector shall interpret the boundary lines from the Zoning Map. When and if
the Zoning Inspector’s interpretation of such boundary line is disputed, the
final interpretation authority shall rest with the Planning and Zoning Board.

§ 153.193 NEWLY ANNEXED AREAS.
   (A)   Subject to the conditions stated below, territory which is annexed
into the city subsequent to the effective date of this chapter shall, upon the
effective date of the annexation, be zoned into the SR District. Within three
months from the date of annexation, the Planning and Zoning Board shall present
a zoning plan for the annexed territory to City Council, however such plan may
be submitted prior to annexation. City Council may hold a public hearing on the
proposed zoning plan, as recommended by the Board. If such hearing is held,
notice of such hearing shall be given in a newspaper of general circulation
within the municipality not less than 30 days before the date of the hearing.
Within 30 days after such hearing, City Council shall approve, or approve with
modification, the zoning plan. If such zoning plan is approved by City Council
prior to the effective date of annexation, then the annexed property shall be
considered to be zoned as specified in such plan on such date.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall prevent the owner of property within the
annexed territory from applying for a zoning amendment, after the effective
date of annexation, pursuant to the procedures specified in §§
153.080 through
153.086.

SR SUBURBAN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
§ 153.205 PURPOSE.
   The Suburban Residential District is established to provide for new single-
family residential development within the city at densities typical of modern
suburban environments. The SR District is to be utilized in areas on the
periphery of the city that are generally vacant at the time of development, but
are serviceable by public water and sewer. It is the intent of the SR District
to discourage large concentrations of intensive development where that density
would be inconsistent with the existing character of the area.

UR URBAN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
§ 153.220 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The UR District is established to provide for the continuance of
single-family housing within the older portions of the city, and to allow for
expansion of such uses at densities consistent with existing development,
thereby encouraging private reinvestment and revitalization in such areas, and
increasing the diversity of housing choice while maintaining adequate
development standards.
   (B)   It is recognized that property in the UR District is located in the
older areas of the city, and that such areas are likely to be characterized by
mixed patterns of land use. Many of these mixed uses are the result of past
development practices and might not be allowed under the current provisions of
this UR District. It is the intent of this chapter, and this district in
particular, to protect and preserve the basic property rights of such existing
nonconforming uses. Specific provisions are made for the continuance,
substitution and extension of such use, pursuant to §§
153.120 through
153.126 and R.C. § 713.15.
   (C)   The district can also be used to allow for new development in outlying
areas of the city by meeting standards intended to promote the historic
neighborhood character of such new development.

MH-R MANUFACTURED HOME RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
§ 153.235 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The city recognizes that manufactured housing presents residential
opportunities and options, especially related to cost, which are unavailable
with conventional site-built housing. Nonetheless, such manufactured housing
has unique development characteristics that require special treatment in regard
to location, placement and land use compatibility.
   (B)   The MH-R Manufactured Home Residential District is established to
provide areas for manufactured homes so as to provide a desirable residential
environment, protected from adverse neighboring influences, with adequate
access for vehicular traffic and circulation. These residential communities
shall be developed and located so as to not promote excessive vehicular traffic
on streets in adjoining neighborhoods, and shall provide overall desirability
equivalent to that for other forms of residential development.

permits single-family residential dwellings.
   (B)   Mobile homes, as defined in §
153.005, shall be considered as a permitted or conditional use in this district
only and not in any other zoning district, except those meeting all of the
following conditions:
      (1)   Parcels in other districts that had mobile homes (single wide
trailers) situated upon them as of April 7, 2002, may have a new mobile home,
being one that is the most current model year available and not previously
titled to a private individual, placed upon that parcel. Any such mobile home
must be occupied by the titled owner.
   (C)   Any parcel that had a mobile home situated upon it on April 7, 2002,
but that sits or has sat empty for a period of ten years or more at the time an
application for building permit is made to the city, is no longer eligible to
have a mobile home placed upon it pursuant to (B)(1) of this section.

that the lowest floor of the structure is least one foot above the 100-year
base flood elevation, as established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) or other authorized
agency, in a flood study or report approved by the city. Required fill areas
must extend 15 feet beyond the limits of the structure(s).
      (4)   When the Planning and Zoning Board determines that only part of a
proposed plat can be developed in compliance with these requirements, it shall
limit development to only that portion, and shall require that the method of
development is consistent with its determination.
      (5)   The Planning and Zoning Board may attach other reasonable
conditions as is appropriate to the approval of plats within areas subject to
flooding. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, requirement for
the construction of dikes, levees or other similar measures, or flood-proofing
of structures, as recommended by the City Engineer.

153.999
§ 153.493 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
   (A)   Measures shall be taken by the owner/developer to minimize erosion and
its impacts during subdivision construction activity. The City Engineer may
require detailed erosion and sedimentation plans to be submitted if it is
determined that the size and/or scale of the proposed subdivision warrants such
action. Generally, such a plan shall be required for major subdivisions
comprising more than 25 lots or more than 15 acres, or if the subdivision is
located where average slope exceeds 5%. Such plans shall be prepared by a
professional engineer and indicate the techniques to be used to control erosion
both during construction and permanently, and include a schedule for installing
same. Erosion control plans shall be based on the control of erosion on-site,
with the objective of eliminating or minimizing erosion and sedimentation
impacts off-site. Techniques, devices and/or measures used shall be reviewed
and approved by the City Engineer.
   (B)   All erosion and sedimentation control devices shall be in place at the
start of construction activity.

153.999
§ 153.494 SURFACE RUNOFF AND STORM DRAINAGE.
   (A)   Outlets. No subdivision shall be approved by the Planning and Zoning
Board unless there is an adequate outlet for storm water, as determined by the
City Engineer. Generally it will be necessary to pipe storm water to an
adequate watercourse, stream or existing storm system which has the capacity to
accommodate the flow, or to utilize acceptable on-site water retention methods
adequate to minimize excessive off-site storm water flows.
   (B)   Preservation of natural drainage courses. No natural drainage course
shall be altered and no fill, buildings or structures shall be located unless
provision is made for the flow of surface water, in a manner satisfactory to
the City Engineer. An easement shall be provided on both sides of the existing
surface drainage course adequate for the purpose of future widening, deepening,
enclosing or otherwise improving said drainage course. If such drainage course
crosses private property, easements must be obtained by the owner/developer for
construction and future maintenance. These easements must be shown on the
construction plans, including the volume and page number of the recorded
easement.
   (C)   Surface routing paths. Generally, it is not economically feasible to
size a storm drainage system to collect and convey more than frequent storm
runoff. The complete drainage system of a proposed subdivision shall contain
two separate drainage elements. Storm sewers comprise the initial system.
Surface routing paths shall be provided to carry the storm water runoff which
exceeds the capacity of the initial system. The system of surface routing paths
shall have the capacity to carry runoff from a storm with a return period of
not less than 100 years, without causing significant threat to property or
public safety.
   (D)   Grades.   All surface areas not covered by hard surface improvements
or stone shall be seeded or sodded and sloped to drain according to the
following:
      (1)   Grass areas shall have a minimum slope or grade of 0.8%;
      (2)   Grass areas next to buildings shall slope away from the building at
not less than 5%, for a minimum of ten feet; and
      (3)   Ditches or swales in grassed areas with a bottom slope or grade
between 2% and 7% shall be sodded. Ditches or swales with a bottom slope or
grade greater than 7% shall have a paved or stone gutter. Underdrains shall be
required in ditches or swales with a bottom grade of less than 2%.
   (E)   Submittal of drainage data. Information and data pertaining to water
volumes and velocities for all watersheds entering and on the property, along
with calculations to show that proposed drainage improvements will adequately
address such flows shall be submitted to the City Engineer, along with required
construction and grading plans. Such drainage data shall be approved by a
professional engineer. Storm drainage systems shall generally be designed so
that the peak rate of storm water runoff from the site after development does
not exceed the peak rate of runoff before development; however, the City
Engineer may grant administrative exceptions to this requirement when specific
conditions warrant such action. The methods and techniques proposed to address
surface runoff shall be designed to accommodate the five-year frequency storm
and shall be consistent with storm water design criteria established by the
City Engineer.
   (F)   Culverts. All culverts shall be constructed of concrete, and shall
have the appropriate headwalls and other structures and improvements to protect
the facility, as determined by the City Engineer.

§ 153.495 STREETS.
   (A)   General. The arrangement of streets shall generally conform to the
Thoroughfare Plan for the city. For streets not indicated on the Thoroughfare
Plan, the arrangement shall provide for appropriate extensions of existing
streets.
   (B)   Classification, street widths and street grades. The arrangement and
classification of all streets in newly developed areas shall conform to the
Thoroughfare Plan. The Planning and Zoning Board shall make the final
determination as to the classification of any new street, based on the
potential development of the site and its potential traffic volume, expressed
in ADT (average daily traffic), the character of the surrounding area and the
Thoroughfare Plan. Rights-of-way, pavement widths and street grades shall be as
specified in Appendix A at the end of this chapter.
   (C)   Alignment.
      (1)   The street pattern shall make provision for the continuance of
streets into adjoining areas and for the connection to existing rights-of-way
in adjacent areas.
      (2)   If a subdivision adjoins or contains an existing or proposed
arterial or major collector street, direct access points to such street shall
be minimized. The Planning and Zoning Board may require marginal access streets
or reverse frontage with a planting strip of a minimum width of 20 feet on the
rear of those lots abutting the street, and no vehicular access across the
strip.
      (3)   If a subdivision adjoins an existing or proposed arterial or major
collector street, the Planning and Zoning Board may require the construction of
separate turn lanes on such streets into the proposed subdivision.
      (4)   Local streets shall be laid out so as to discourage use by through
traffic.
      (5)   Streets shall intersect one another at 90 degrees, or as near to 90
degrees as possible, but in no case less than 75 degrees. The intersecting
street must remain within these degree parameters for a distance of not less
than 100 feet from the intersection.
      (6)   Street jogs shall be discouraged. Where such jogs are unavoidable,
in no case shall the centerlines be offset by less than 125 feet.
      (7)   The maximum length of a cul-de-sac shall be 600 feet, measured from
the centerline of the intersecting street to the middle of the turn-around.
      (8)   Half width streets shall be prohibited.
   (D)   Dedication. The necessary rights-of-way for widening or extension of
all thoroughfares, as delineated in the Thoroughfare Plan, shall be dedicated
to public use. When a subdivision fronts on an existing city street, or county
or township road, dedication shall be made to the proper authority so as to
meet the requirements of the table in Appendix A.
   (E)   Blocks.   Blocks shall not exceed 1,200 feet in length except where
specific topographic conditions require a greater length.
   (F)   Street names. The names of new streets shall not duplicate names of
existing dedicated streets, except that new streets which are extensions of
existing streets shall bear the names of such existing streets. All new
roadways shall be named according to the following manner.
 
Direction                  Cul-de-sacs All Other Streets
Curving (over 1,000 feet)  Drive       Drive

   (G)   Curbs, gutters and sidewalks. Curbs, gutters and sidewalks shall be
required in all subdivisions, except those where lot width of at least 80% of
the lots exceed 80 feet, unless the Planning and Zoning Board specifically
grants a waiver. In no case shall a certificate of occupancy be granted for a
building within a new subdivision where sidewalks are required, until such
sidewalks on the lot are constructed and approved.
   (H)   Driveways. 
      (1)   All driveways shall be at least three feet from the side lot line.
      (2)   No driveway shall be approved providing direct access from a
single- or two-family residential lot to a street designated on the
Thoroughfare Plan as an arterial or major collector street, except where no
alternative access is available.

§ 153.496 LOTS.
   (A)   All lots shall have the required frontage on an improved public street
or an approved private street.
   (B)   Lots in subdivisions located within the city shall meet the dimension
and area requirements of the zoning district in which such subdivision is
located. Residential lots that are located outside the zoning authority of the
city, but within the subdivision jurisdiction of this chapter, shall conform to
the zoning requirements of the jurisdiction in which they are located. All lots
shall also meet the following requirements.
      (1)   All residential lots shall be approximately rectangular in shape
and should not have a depth in excess of three times their width, except where
extra depth is necessary due to topography and/or natural conditions, or to
meet other requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided, except
where required to provide separation from arterial streets, or to overcome
specific conditions of topography and/or orientation. In such cases, an
easement shall be provided along the rear lot line across which there shall be
no vehicular access.
      (3)   Whenever possible, residential subdivisions shall be designed so
that corner lots have a larger area than interior lots.
      (4)   Whenever possible, side lot lines should be at right angles or
radial to street lines.
      (5)   Necessary easements shall be provided along side and rear lot lines
for utility lines.
      (6)   Easements shall be provided on both sides of any open drainage
course, for the purposes of widening, deepening or general maintenance. Such
easements shall be a minimum of ten feet on both sides, or the total width
required to maintain surface routing paths pursuant to §
153.494, whichever is greater. In no case shall a fence or any other
obstruction be constructed on this easement.

except under special conditions, when this requirement may be waived by the
Planning and Zoning Board, upon recommendation by the City Engineer.
   (C)   Only under circumstances of extreme hardship shall sewage lift
stations, sewage grinder pumps or individual household sewage disposal systems
be permitted in subdivisions established after the effective date of this
chapter. Such systems shall only be permitted with the approval of the Planning
and Zoning Board. The owner/developer shall be responsible for all costs
associated with any lift station until such time that 60% of the lots in the
subdivision are developed.
   (D)   Minimum line size shall be eight inches. Downstream sewer pipe sizes
shall be greater than or equal to the upstream size unless otherwise approved
by the Planning and Zoning Board. If larger pipe sizes are required to
accommodate future growth, the city may participate in the costs associated
with the larger sizes, in accordance with §§
153.475 through

authorized to make and adopt rules and regulations for the internal
administration of his or her office, provided that such rules and regulations
shall not be in conflict with provisions or intent of this chapter or rules and
regulations and provisions of law enforced by the Wellston City and the Jackson
County Health Department of the State of Ohio.
      (1)   All rules and regulations adopted by the Director of Code
Enforcement shall have the same force and effect as the provisions of this
Code.
      (2)   The Director of Code Enforcement shall develop and adopt a plan for
the periodic inspection of rental dwellings and rooming houses subject to the
provisions governing the issuance of a permit for the operation of such rental
dwelling or rooming house. Such plan for periodic inspection shall include a
provision which will give tenants or occupants a minimum of 24 hours' notice
prior to an inspection, however, the 24-hour notice may be waived by the tenant
or occupant.
      (3)   All rules and regulations and plan for inspections shall be filed
with the Service-Safety Director of the City of Wellston and shall be made
public upon request.

adopted pursuant thereto has been committed, or when the Code Inspector has a
valid reason to believe that a violation of the provisions of the Code, or any
rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, exists. If, upon inspection, a
structure, building or dwelling/rooming unit is found in "violation" of this
Code, the Director of Code Enforcement or his/her authorized agent shall issue
to the owner of said structure, building or dwelling/rooming unit or his
authorized agent a list of noted violations to be known as a "notice of
violation." The owner or his or her authorized agent and/or the occupant(s), as
appropriate, shall have 30 days from the issuance of a notice of violation to
correct such noted violations as have been noted or to take the matter to the
Housing Appeals Board. If, after 30 days from the issuance of a notice of
violation, such noted violations of this Code have not been begun in good
faith, nearly corrected or corrected, and not taken to the Housing Appeals
Board, the Director of Code Enforcement or his or her authorized agent shall
issue an "order to comply." This order to comply shall list the violations
initially found and not begun in good faith, nearly corrected or corrected, as
evidenced by sufficient documentation, in the notice of violation. The owner or
his authorized agent shall have 15 days from the issuance of an order to comply
to correct such violations. If, after 30 days from the issuance of an order to
comply, such violations are not corrected, the Director of Code Enforcement or
his or her authorized agent shall institute appropriate proceedings under §
154.99.
      (1)   The Director of Code Enforcement shall be responsible for keeping a
written record of the findings of all inspections. These records shall be
available to the public at cost upon request.
      (2)   Information not related to the enforcement of the Housing Code
which may be discovered in the course of an inspection shall be considered

consent of the owner and of the occupant of the dwelling unit inspected. If any
information pertaining to criminal activity is discovered pursuant to a housing
inspection, such information is not privileged under this Code.
      (3)   All records pertaining to the identification of a complainant shall
be kept separate and confidential from the public record of inspection and

application, biennial inspections and notices of violations pertaining to any
premises shall be public record and available upon request.

      (6)   Pursuant to implementation of division (B)(2) of this section, any
owner, occupant or person having care of property where a periodic or
nonperiodic inspection has been scheduled shall be assessed a fee established
by separate ordinance if this inspection is missed or not cancelled at least 24
hours prior to the scheduled inspection.
   (D)   Nonperiodic inspection. Upon presentation of proper credentials and

Enforcement has probable cause to suspect that violations exist.
      (2)   The occupants shall be informed of their right to refuse entry. If
any person in charge of a dwelling refuses to permit free access to the

jurisdiction an order directing compliance with the inspection requirements of
the Housing Code.
   (E)   Owner's right of entry. Every occupant of a dwelling, multi-family
dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming house or rooming unit shall give the owner

(Ord. 2021-41, passed 9-2-2021)
§ 154.03 RENTAL DWELLING AND HOUSING PERMIT.
   (A)   Rental permit required. All residential property within the City of
Wellston owned for rental purposes or occupied by a party other than the owner
for a period of more than six months during any single calendar year, shall
require a rental dwelling or rooming house permit from the Office of Code
Enforcement. Traditional motels and hotels are excluded from the necessity of
obtaining a rental dwelling or rooming house permit. Nontraditional (long-term)
rentals in hotels and motels are not excluded.
   (B)   Application. To obtain a rental dwelling or rooming house permit, the
owner of a rental dwelling or rooming house, as defined in this Code, shall
apply to the Code Enforcement Office of the City of Wellston. A rental dwelling
or rooming house permit shall be issued by the Director of Code Enforcement if,
upon inspection of the rental dwelling or rooming house, it is determined that
the rental dwelling or rooming house meets the requirements of this Code. Such
an inspection shall be made within 30 days after said application has been
made. Upon application for a permit, the owner of a rental dwelling or rooming
house may rent or lease the premises at his or her own risk, subject to the
subsequent approval of the permit by the Director of Code Enforcement. The
Director of Code Enforcement shall deny the issuance of a permanent permit to
any owner or operator whose structure does not, within 30 days, comply with
this Code. Any permit granted or issued under the terms of this Code to an
owner or operator may be suspended or revoked at any time by the Director of
Code Enforcement upon satisfactory proof of violation of any provision pursuant
to this Code or which could have been grounds for failure to issue an original
permit. Any person who feels aggrieved by such denial may pursue the remedies
as outlined in §
154.07 (Housing Appeals Board). If a permit is suspended or revoked after a
hearing as provided in §
154.07, said permit shall be surrendered to the Code Enforcement Office within
five days of notification of such suspension or revocation.
   (C)   Zoning certification required. Any person applying for a rental
dwelling or rooming house permit shall include zoning compliance verification.

state the maximum number of persons who may occupy the rental dwelling or
rooming house as determined by this Code and other ordinances of the City of
Wellston.
   (E)   Authorized agent. No rental dwelling or rooming house permit shall be
issued or received unless the applicant designates, in addition to himself, an
agent for the receipt of process pursuant to this Code. Said agent must be
designated in writing on the application for said permit. Such agent must
reside within Jackson County.
   (F)   Notice of change of ownership. Any person selling or otherwise
relinquishing ownership or control of a rental dwelling or rooming house for
which a rental dwelling or rooming house permit has been issued shall notify
the Code Enforcement Office of said change in ownership within five days of the
effective date of the transfer. Such notice shall be in writing and shall
include:
      (1)   The name and address of the new owner;
      (2)   The name and address of the previous owner; and
      (3)   The agent for the new owner as required under the provisions of
division (E) of this section.
   (G)   Expirations and renewals. Every rental dwelling and rooming house
permit shall be renewed annually on January 2. A flat fee, established by
ordinance, will be assessed for each dwelling/rooming house permit fee unpaid
on March 1.
   (H)   Fees.
      (1)   The annual fee for a rental dwelling or rooming house permit shall
be established by ordinance. Nothing herein contained shall prohibit the owner
of a dwelling used for rental purposes from treating all the required
inspection fees as a normal business expense incidental to the renting of
property and, therefore, an appropriate consideration in the determination of
debt. A permit issued after July 1 shall pay half of the annual fee for that
year.
      (2)   Failure to pay a rental permit fee within one year after the date
of its mailing, shall result in the cancellation of the rental permit.
      (3)   Said rental permit shall be reinstated upon payment of all past due
amounts, plus interest, along with a reinstatement fee of $100 per unit.
   (I)   City of Wellston occupancy permit and compliance form. Effective
January 1, 2022, it is the responsibility of the owner to place the City of
Wellston occupancy permit and compliance form on the back of the main entrance
door of each rental unit, or on the wall next to the entrance door. For all
rentals, the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of both the property owner
and the agent, along with the address of the rental property, must be provided
with the payment of the rental fee.
      (1)   This information will be placed on the City of Wellston occupancy
permit and compliance form by the Code Enforcement Office, along with the
maximum permitted occupancy and expiration date.
      (2)   The Office of Code Enforcement will provide one copy of the form
for each rental unit. A fee of $5 will be charged for additional or replacement
copies.
   (J)   Display of occupancy permit and compliance form. It shall be the
responsibility of the owner or agent of a rental dwelling or rooming house to
post the City of Wellston occupancy permit and compliance form. This posted
form is part of the rental inspection requirements. Failure to post said form
is a minor misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $150.
   (K)   Suspension and reinstatement.
      (1)   At the end of the time allowed for correction of violations cited,
the Code Inspector, lacking sufficient documentary evidence of compliance,
shall reinspect the rental dwelling or rooming house. If he determines that
such conditions have not been corrected, he may issue an order suspending the
operating permit.
      (2)   Any person whose permit to operate a rental dwelling or rooming
house has been suspended shall be entitled to a reconsideration of the order by
the Zoning Board in the manner herein provided. If no request for
reconsideration or appeals reaches the Zoning Board within 14 days following
receipt of an order of suspension, the permit shall be revoked, except that
prior to revocation any person whose permit has been suspended may request
reinspection, upon a showing that the violation or violations cited in the
notice have been corrected.
      (3)   When the owner or agent has been ordered by the Code Inspector to
correct violations that may exist in a dwelling, as noted in the procedure in
division (C) of this section, the inspector shall reinspect the property to
verify compliance with the original order. If additional inspections are
required, due to noncompliance, a fee to be established by ordinance shall be
assessed to the owner for each additional inspection. A reinstatement fee shall
be established by ordinance.
(Ord. 2021-41, passed 9-2-2021)
§ 154.04 CONDEMNATION.
   (A)   Condemnation. When a structure or part thereof is found by the Code
Official to be unsafe, or when a structure or part thereof is found unfit for
human occupancy or use, or is found unlawful, it may be condemned pursuant to
the provisions of this Code and may be placarded and vacated, and a proper
affidavit prepared by the Code Enforcement Office, and such action shall be
recorded in the county recorder's office and cross-referenced to the deed to
the property. It shall not be reoccupied without approval of the Code Official.
Unsafe equipment shall be placarded and placed out of service.
   (B)   Vacation of unsafe structure. Whenever an occupied structure is
declared unsafe or unfit for human habitation, the tenants shall be removed
within 48 hours. If the condition is the result of the owner, he or she shall
be responsible for providing accommodation mutually agreed upon by the landlord
or agent and tenants at his or her expense until repairs are made and the Code
Officer releases the unit for occupancy. If the condition is the fault of the
tenant(s) (e.g., sanitation) neither the owner nor the city will be held
responsible for the cost of temporary lodging.
   (C)   Closing of vacant structures. If the structure or part thereof is
vacant and unfit for human habitation, occupancy or use and is not in danger of
structural collapse, the Code Official may post a placard of condemnation on
the premises and may order the structure closed up so it will not be an
attractive nuisance. Upon failure of the owner to close up the premises within
the time specified in the order, the Code Official shall cause it to be closed
through any available public agency or by contract or arrangement by private
persons, and the cost thereof shall be charged against the real estate upon
which the structure is located and shall be a lien against such real estate.
   (D)   Re-occupancy of the building. No structure which has been condemned
and placarded as unfit for human habitation or use shall again be used until
written approval has been secured from the Code Enforcement Office. The Code
Official shall then remove the placard whenever the defects resulting in the
posting of the placard have been eliminated and shall also file an affidavit
with the county recorder's office to that effect.
(Ord. 2021-41, passed 9-2-2021)
§ 154.05 PLACARDING.
   (A)   Placarding of structure. After the condemnation notice required under
the provisions of this Code has resulted in an order of virtue of failure to
comply within the time given, the Code Official may post on the premises,
structure or parts thereof, or on defective equipment, a placard bearing the
words:
WARNING
This property has been determined by the Code Enforcement Office to be unfit
for human habitation and in violation of the Wellston City Housing Code. It
shall be unlawful for this building to be rented, leased or occupied from the
date of this notice or until all repairs required by the Code have been made in
a manner satisfactory to and approved in writing by the Code Enforcement
Office, subject to occupants being given a reasonable time thereafter to
vacate. Mutilation or unauthorized removal or defacing of this placard shall be
an offense punishable under Section 154.99 of the Wellston City Code.
   (B)   Prohibited use. Any person who shall occupy a placarded premises or
structure or part thereof, or shall use placarded equipment, and any owner or
person responsible for the premises who shall let anyone occupy a placarded
premise shall be liable for the penalties provided by this Code.
   (C)   Removal of placard. The Code Official shall remove the condemnation
placard whenever the defect or defects upon which the condemnation and
placarding action were based have been eliminated. Any person who defaces or
removes a condemnation placard without the approval of the Code Official shall
be subject to the penalties provided by this Code.
(Ord. 2021-41, passed 9-2-2021)
§ 154.06 DEMOLITION OF BUILDINGS.
   (A)   General. The Director of Code Enforcement or Service-Safety Director
may order the owner of premises upon which is located any structure or part
thereof which, in the Code Official's judgment, is so old, dilapidated or has
become so out of repair as to be dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary or otherwise
unfit for human habitation, occupancy or use, and so that it would be
unreasonable to repair the same, to raze and remove such structure or part
thereof; or if it can be made safe by repairs, to repair and make safe and
sanitary or to raze and remove at the owner's option; or where there has been a
cessation of normal construction of any structure for a period of more than two
years, to raze and remove such structure or part thereof.
   (B)   Unreasonable repairs. Any nonconforming building properly condemned
and placarded under §§
154.04 and
154.05 shall conform to the requirements set forth in the Wellston Zoning Code.
   (C)   Order. The order shall specify a time not to exceed 60 days in which
the owner shall comply therewith and specify repairs, if any. It shall be
served on the owner of record or an agent where an agent is in charge of the
building and upon the holder of any encumbrance of record in the manner
provided for service of a summons by a court of record. If the owner or a
holder of an encumbrance of record cannot be found, the order may be served by
posting it on the main entrance of the building and by publishing it once each
week for three successive weeks in a newspaper authorized to provide service by
publication.
   (D)   Permits. No person, firm or corporation shall move, relocate, remove
or demolish any structure without a valid demolition permit. A separate permit
is required for each structure. Applicants for a demolition permit shall pay to
the City of Wellston a fee to be established by ordinance for each story to be
demolished, excluding cellars.
   (E)   Insurance. No demolition permit shall be issued until the applicant
has furnished the Service-Safety Director or his or her designate and the City
Law Director with proof of effective liability insurance in the amount of
$300,000/$1,000,000 (CSL). No proof of insurance is needed for demolition of a
one-story accessory building less than 576 square feet in area.
   (F)   Restraining actions. Anyone affected by an order of demolition may,
within ten working days after service of such order, apply to a court of record
for an order restraining the Code Official from razing and removing such
structure or parts thereof. The court shall determine whether the order of the
Code Official is reasonable, and if found reasonable, the court shall dissolve
the restraining order; if found not reasonable, the court shall continue the
restraining order or modify it as the circumstances may require.
   (G)   Failure to comply. Whenever the owner of a property fails to comply
with a demolition order within the time prescribed, the Code Official shall
cause the structure or part thereof to be razed and removed, either through an
available public agency or by contract or arrangement with private persons, and
the cost of such razing and removal shall be charged against the real estate
upon which the structure is located and a lien shall be placed against such
real estate.
   (H)   Penalties. See §
154.99.
(Ord. 2021-41, passed 9-2-2021)
§ 154.07 ZONING BOARD.
   (A)   Appointment. There is hereby created a Housing Appeals Board,
hereinafter referred to as "the Board." The Board shall be appointed by the
Mayor then approved by City Council and shall consist of five members appointed
to three over-lapping terms.
      (1)   In the event that a vacancy shall occur during the term of any
member, his or her successor shall be appointed for the unexpired portion of
such term in the same manner as the original appointment. Appointments made to
replace vacancies at the end of full terms shall be for the term of three
years. The City Council may appoint, for a term of three years, two alternate
members of the Board, in addition to the five members provided for, who shall
act with full power only when a regular member is absent from a meeting or is
unable to vote because of interest in the matter.
      (2)   When possible, at least three members of the Board shall be
representative of the following or similar areas: insurance, urban planning,
law, architecture or engineering; one member shall be a current landlord of
residential rental property in the City of Wellston; and one member shall be a

(2003 Code, § 155.08) (Ord. 3438, passed 9-20-2001)
§ 155.09 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   In considering the appropriateness of any proposed change, including
landscaping or exterior signing, the Historic District Review Board shall
consider the following.
   (A)   All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of
their own time. Alterations that have no historical bias and which seek to
create an earlier appearance inconsistent or inappropriate to the original
integrity of the building shall be discouraged.
   (B)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a historic
building, structure, site and/or its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural or
environmental features should be avoided when possible.
   (C)   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original structure would
be unimpaired. Additions to the least significant and least visible of historic
properties should be given priority over other designs.
   (D)   Whereas changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site and
its environment, if these changes are deemed to have acquired significance,
then this significance shall be recognized and respected.
   (E)   Significant architectural features which have deteriorated shall be
repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or
placement of architectural features should be based on accurate duplication of
the feature, and if possible, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial
evidence rather than on conjectural designs or availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
   (F)   The visual and functional components of the building and its site
including, but not limited to, building height, massing and proportion, roof
shape and slope, landscape design and plant materials, lighting, vehicular and
pedestrian circulation and signing.
   (G)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
   (H)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or culture material, and such
design is compatible with the size, sale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
   (I)   The surface cleaning of masonry structures shall be undertaken with
methods designed to minimize damage to historic building materials.
Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building
materials should be avoided.
   (J)   Attention shall be taken to avoid the environmentally harmful effect
often created by the clash of undisguised contemporary materials with those of
older origin, such as aluminum or other metals, plastic, glass and fiberglass
used improperly with brick, stone, wood and masonry.
   (K)   The Historic Review Board shall favor use of traditional and authentic
earth tone colors and trim colors as opposed to colors of contemporary origin.
(2003 Code, § 155.09) (Ord. 3438, passed 9-20-2001) Penalty, see §
155.99
§ 155.10 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   In considering an area building, structure or work of art in the Historic
District, the following criteria shall apply.
   (A)   Existing structures, buildings and open areas. Reconstruction and/or
rehabilitation of structures within the Historic District shall conform to the
distinguishing, original exterior qualities or character of the structure, its
site, and its environment. Please consider the following:
      (1)   The character or value of a property or area as part of the
heritage or cultural characteristic of the city;
      (2)   Identified as the work of an architect or notable builder whose
work has influenced the development of the city;
      (3)   A unique location or physical characteristic that represents an
established feature of the Historic District; and
      (4)   The location as a site of a significant historic event.
   (B)   New construction. The design of new structure and additions to
existing structures, including new site improvements, shall take into account
the architectural style, general design, arrangement, texture, material and
color of other structures and premises within the same location.
   (C)   The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation shall
apply and are as follows.
      (1)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
      (2)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
      (3)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historic development, such
as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings
shall not be undertaken.
      (4)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
      (5)   Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be
preserved.
      (6)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or
pictorial evidence.
      (7)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials, shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
      (8)   Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
      (9)   New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
      (10)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   (D)   Materials. All new structures and all reconstruction or remodeling of
existing structures within the Historic District shall utilize natural
traditional exterior materials such as brick, stone, masonry and wood. The use
of contemporary materials, such as aluminum, other metals, fiberglass and
plastics for exterior surfaces on architecturally significant structures shall
be prohibited unless the use of such materials would contribute to preservation
or enhancement of existing traditional materials and the overall integrity and
longevity of a structure.
   (E)   Color. Traditional colors that are identified with the origin or the
era in which the structure of property was originally built shall be used for
exteriors for all new structures to be built, and the reconstruction,
remodeling and exterior maintenance of existing structures within the Historic
District.
   (F)   Signs. All signs within the Historic District shall conform to the
color and material standards of this section, be of such a style, size and/or
