EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

except as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

(ORC 1.56)
   (c)    Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.

provision prevail.

meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)    An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)    If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)    The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history;
      (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the

person, and/or by means of video conference, or any other similar electronic
technology (hereinafter collectively referred to in this Section as “electronic
technology”), or any combination of in-person and electronic technology. Each
municipal body may establish rules of conduct for the meetings and hearings of
such municipal body, as long as such rules are in compliance with this section.
   (b)    Any resolution, ordinance, rule, decision or other formal action of
any kind made or taken during any municipal body meeting or hearing conducted
entirely or in-part with members attending, participating, and voting by
electronic technology, shall have the same effect as if it had occurred during
an in-person meeting or hearing of the municipal body.
   (c)    Members of a municipal body who attend meetings or hearings by means
of electronic technology, shall be considered present as if in-person at the
meeting or hearing, shall be permitted to vote, and shall be counted for
purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the meeting or hearing,
so long as the member attending the meeting or hearing by electronic technology
is visible to the other members and the public.
   (d)    Notice of any meeting or hearing conducted entirely or in-part with
members attending, participating, and voting by electronic technology, shall be

If no in-person access to the public for a particular municipal body meeting is
feasible due to health or safety concerns, or if any member of a municipal body
is permitted to attend, participate and vote at a municipal body meeting or
hearing by electronic technology, then public access shall be provided to the
public by electronic technology during such meeting or hearing.
   (f)    The Village may determine the method of attendance and participation,
if permitted, by the public through electronic technology, and such method need
not be the same as the method of electronic technology used by a member of the

electronic technology allowing attendance and/or participation by the public
may include, but are not limited to, live-streaming by means of the internet,
local television, cable, or public access channels, or by means of any other

   (g)    This section does not require that members of the public wishing to

electronic technology, even if in-person access by the public is limited by
health or safety concerns, or any law or regulation.
   (h)    The authority granted in this section applies notwithstanding any
conflicting provision of the Codified Ordinances. Nothing in this section shall
be construed to negate any other provision of the Codified Ordinances that is

the bid solicitation, the Village shall establish the time limit for awarding a
contract. Submitted bids may not be withdrawn during this period. The Village's
failure to award and execute the contract within this period invalidates the
entire bid proceedings and all bids submitted, unless the time for awarding and
executing the contract is extended by mutual consent of the Village and the
bidder whose bid the Village accepts and with respect to whom the Village
subsequently awards and executes a contract. Such an agreed extension shall not
entitle the contractor to delay costs.

cost.

proceed with the work by the Village or its representative upon execution of
the contract. The Village shall either issue the notice to proceed at a time
that it determines is in its best interest, or it shall terminate the contract
for its convenience.
 
   (m)    Retainage. Retainage shall be withheld from payments to the
contractor at the rate set forth in the Owner/Contractor agreement. Retainage
shall not be held in an escrow account. Retainage shall be released at such
times and in such amounts as the Village determines to be equitable.

single contract for constructing and managing an entire public improvement
project.
 
   (o)    Extension of Bid Opening. The Village may issue an addendum or

the bid opening at any time prior to the bid opening. If an addendum is issued
within forty-eight hours before the bid opening, the bid opening shall be
extended by at least three days.
 
   (p)    Combined Statement of Material and Labor. The Village at its
discretion may accept a combined statement of labor and materials from bidders.
 
   (q)    Bonus and Liquidated Damages for Time. The Village may offer a bonus
for completion of a contract prior to a specified date or may exact liquidated
damages for each day of delay beyond a specified date, or both. The amounts of
the bonus and liquidated damages may be different.
(Ord. 2015-50. Passed 8-12-15.)
 
107.02 GRANTS.
   (a)    All applications for grants which require matching funds shall be
authorized by a majority vote of Council and the completed grant application
shall be provided by the department head making the legislative request.

      (6)    By sale for scrap value or by discarding, if the property can be
shown to have minimal or no residual market value in its current form.
      (7)    By destruction upon the determination by the Director of Public

   (e)    If no bid is obtained where required for the sale of personal

   (f)    Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, Council may, by
ordinance enacted hereafter, adopt a different procedure for the sale of any
particular personal property.
(Ord. 2015-50. Passed 8-12-15.)
107.04 AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT DONATIONS.

others.
      (3)   Death or serious illness or injury of a member of the employee’s
immediate family or household. “Immediate family” means an employee’s spouse

         (Ord. 1993-32. Passed 5-19-93.)
   (b)   Sick leave shall be earned at the rate of 4.6 hours of sick leave for

written signed statement to justify use of sick leave.
      (3)   Requests for use of sick leave for absences from regularly assigned

duties for a period of less than three consecutive work days may be approved
without medical certification, upon the employee’s written statement as
provided in subsection (a) hereof; provided however, that use of sick leave
without medical certification, shall not exceed four work days in any
consecutive twelve-month period.
      (5)   Requests for use of sick leave for the day preceding and/or the day
following a legal and/or scheduled holiday shall be accompanied by medical

      (6)   When an employee is on sick leave for a period of at least fourteen
days, he shall advise his immediate supervisor of his recovery progress at
least once every two weeks.
   (d)   In the event an employee is determined to have falsified his request
for use of sick leave or medical or other related documentation or is found to
have taken sick leave without due cause, such leave shall be cancelled
forthwith and the employee ordered to return to work. In addition to any other
penalty permitted by law for such falsification or improper taking of sick
leave, an employee may be deprived of wages for the period of his improper
absence, compelled to repay any wages he may have received therefor, penalized
by forfeiture of any part or all of his accrued sick leave, and may be
subjected to other disciplinary action, including dismissal. To prevent

designated by the Mayor and approved by Council to ascertain the nature and
extent of illness claimed.

   (f)   An employee with ten or more years of service may elect at the time of
his or her disability or service retirement from active service with the
Municipality to receive pay for one-fourth the value of his or her accrued but
unused sick leave credit. The payment shall be based on the employee’s rate of
pay at the time of retirement and eliminates all sick leave credit accrued but
unused by the employee at the time payment is made. For purposes of this
payment, the maximum permitted accumulation of accrued but unused sick leave
credit shall not exceed two hundred forty hours for any employee of the
Village, so that the maximum payment shall not exceed sixty hours at the
employee’s rate of pay at retirement. Such payment shall only be made once to
any employee.
Any payment for any accumulated sick leave is forfeited upon termination of
employment other than by election upon retirement as indicated in subsection
(f) herein.

   (k)   Employees who wish to donate leave shall certify:
      (1)   The name of the employee for whom the donated leave is intended;
      (2)   The number of hours to be donated;
      (3)   That the employee’s donation of leave is no more than 50% of the

(Sec. 703), it is the policy of the Village of Woodmere that all employees
should be allowed to work in an environment free from sexual harassment.
   “Sexual harassment” is defined as any unwelcome sexual advance, request for
sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:
      (1)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly
a term or condition of an individual’s employment;
      (2)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      (3)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering
with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   Such conduct is a violation of an employee’s rights and is expressly
forbidden here in the Village.
   (b)   Grievance Procedure. The following grievance procedure is established
to investigate, hear and resolve the complaints of Village employees in regard
to sexual harassment.
      (1)   Complaints of sexual harassment should be made in writing by the
affected employee within fifteen working days of the incident which gave rise
to the complaint. The complaint shall be made to the employee’s Department Head
and shall include the date, time and a description of the alleged harassment.
      (2)   If it shall be inappropriate for the complainant to address the
complaint to his or her Department Head where the accused and the Department
Head are the same, then the complaint shall be addressed directly to the Mayor.
      (3)   The Department Head shall be responsible for forwarding the
complaint to the Mayor immediately upon receipt. Within five working days of
receipt of the written complaint and upon notice to all parties, an
administrative hearing will be held. The complainant, accused, Department Head

legal counsel.
      (4)   Violation of this policy may result in an oral reprimand, written
reprimand, suspension from duty without pay for a special period of time or
dismissal.

harassment, the Mayor will look at the record as a whole and the totality of
the circumstances, such as the nature of the sexual advances and the context in
which the alleged incidents occurred. The determinations of the legality of a
particular action will be made from the specific facts on a case-by-case basis.
      (6)   Each Department Head shall advise of and review with each employee
in the particular department the adoption of this policy and compliant
procedure.
      (7)   The Mayor shall render a decision within five working days of the
hearing based upon the complaint and all other resources available.

157.16 SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY.
   (a)   Policy. The Village is dedicated to providing safe, dependable and
efficient services to the public. We also recognize that our employees are our
most valuable resource and it is our goal to provide a healthy, satisfying
working environment which promotes personal opportunities for growth. In
meeting these goals, it is our policy to:
      (1)   Assure that employees are not impaired in their ability to perform
assigned duties in a safe, productive and healthy manner;
      (2)   Create a workplace environment free from the adverse effects of
drug and alcohol substance abuse;
      (3)   Prohibit the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing,
possession or use of controlled substances; and
      (4)   Make an employee assistance program available to employees whose
personal problems, including alcohol or drug dependency, adversely affect their
ability to perform their duties.
   (b)   Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to assure worker fitness for
duty and to protect our employees and the public from the risks posed by the
use of alcohol and prohibited drugs and to maintain a workplace free of alcohol
or drugs.
   (c)   Applicability. This policy applies to all Village employees, paid
part-time employees and contractors when they are on Village property or when
performing Village- related business off-site or when in uniform. This policy
applies to off-site lunch periods or breaks when an employee is scheduled to
return to work. Visitors, vendors and contractor employees are governed by this
policy while on transit premises and shall not be permitted to conduct Village
business if found to be in violation of this policy.
   A copy of this policy shall be posted in each municipal facility to be
readily available for review by each employee of the municipality.
   (d)   Definitions. The following categories of prohibited substances are
addressed by this policy:

amphetamines, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP) and cocaine, as well as so-called
"designer drugs" not approved for medical use by the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Illegal use includes
use of any illegal drug, misuse of legally prescribed drugs, and use of
illegally obtained prescription drugs.
      (2)   "Legal drugs". The appropriate use of legally prescribed drugs and
nonprescribed medications is not prohibited. However, the use of any substance
which carries a warning label that indicates that mental functioning, motor
skills or judgment may be adversely affected should be reported to supervisory
personnel and medical advice should be sought, as appropriate, before
performing work-related duties.
(3)   "Alcohol". The use of alcohol-containing beverages or substances such
that alcohol is present in the body while performing Village business is
prohibited.
   (e)   Prohibited Conduct.
      (1)   Manufacture, trafficking, possession and use. Any employee engaging
in the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession or use of prohibited
substances (controlled substances or illegal drugs or alcohol) on Village
premises, in Village vehicles, or while on Village business shall be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Law enforcement shall be
notified, as appropriate, where criminal activity is suspected.
      (2)   Intoxication/under the influence. Any employee who is reasonably
suspected of being intoxicated, impaired or under the influence of a prohibited
substance (such as having a prohibited substance in the body) shall be
suspended from job duties pending an investigation and verification of
condition. Employees found to be under the influence of prohibited substances
or who fail to pass a drug test shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to
and including termination.
      (3)   Compliance with testing requirements. In an effort to maintain a
drug and alcohol-free workplace, all employees shall be subject to urine and
blood alcohol drug testing. Any employee who refuses to comply with a request
for drug testing, who provides false information in connection with a test, or
who attempts to falsify test results through tampering, contamination,
adulteration or substitution shall be terminated for insubordination.
      (4)   Treatment requirements. All employees are encouraged to make use of
the available resources for treatment for substance abuse problems. The Village
offers the Employee Assistance Program through the office of the Mayor. Under
circumstances employees may be required to undergo treatment for substance
abuse. Any employee who refuses or fails to comply with Village's requirements
for treatment, after care, or return to duty shall be subject to disciplinary
action, up to and including termination.
      (5)   Notifying the office of the Mayor of criminal drug conviction. Any
employee who fails to notify in writing the office of the Mayor of any criminal
drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later
than five days after such conviction shall be subject to disciplinary action,
up to and including termination.
      (6)   Proper application of the policy. The Village is dedicated to
assuring fair and equitable application of this substance abuse policy.
Therefore, supervisors/managers are encouraged to use and apply all aspects of
this policy in an unbiased and impartial manner. Any supervisor/manager who
knowingly disregards the requirements of this policy, or who is found to
deliberately misuse the policy in regard to subordinates, shall be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
   (f)   Drug Testing. All employees shall be subject to analytical testing of
either urine or blood prior to employment, for reasonable cause, following an
accident, and prior to and after return to duty after failing a drug test and/
or after completion of rehabilitation treatment or as required by Federal
Regulations. To comply with Urban Mass Transit Administration 49 CFR 653.17,
employees who perform UMTA-defined sensitive safety functions shall also be
subject to testing on a random, unannounced basis.
   Testing shall be conducted in a manner to assure a high degree of accuracy
and reliability and using techniques and laboratory facilities which have been
approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The
Village affirms the need to protect individual dignity, privacy and
confidentiality throughout the testing process. Personal data regarding the
drug testing program shall be released only to those persons who have a bona
fide need to know the information for proper administration of the anti-drug
program.
      (1)   Pre-employment testing. All applicants shall undergo chemical
testing prior to employment. Receipt by the Civil Service Commission of
satisfactory test results is required prior to employment and failure of a drug
test shall disqualify an applicant for employment for a period of 120 days.
Evidence of the absence of drug or alcohol dependency from a substance abuse
treatment provider or other qualified medical or mental health practitioner
shall be required prior to further consideration for employment.
      (2)   Reasonable cause testing. Employees may be subject to a fitness for
duty evaluation, to include appropriate urine and/or blood testing, when there
is reason to believe that drug or alcohol use is adversely affecting job
performance. A reasonable cause referral for testing shall be made on the basis
of documented objective facts and circumstances which are consistent with the
long or short-term effects of substance abuse. Examples of reasonable cause
include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   Adequate documentation of unsatisfactory work performance or on-
the-job behavior;
         B.   Physical signs and symptoms consistent with substance use;
         C.   Evidence of the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession
or use of controlled substances, drugs, alcohol or other prohibited substances;
         D.   Occurrence of a serious or potentially serious accident that may
have been caused by human error; and
         E.   Fights (to mean physical contact), assaults and flagrant
disregard or violations of established safety, security or other operating
procedures.
Reasonable cause testing determinations shall be made by supervisors who are
trained to detect the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol use and who
reasonably conclude that an employee may be adversely affected or impaired in
his/her work performance due to substance abuse.
      (3)   Post-accident testing. Employees shall be subject to urine and/or
blood testing if they are involved in an accident that results in a fatality,
injuries requiring medical attention, or property damage estimated to be equal
to or greater than four hundred dollars ($400.00).
      (4)   Random testing. Employees in Urban Mass Transit Administration
defined "sensitive safety" positions shall be subjected to random, unannounced
urine testing.
      (5)   Return to duty testing. All employees who previously tested
positive on a drug test shall test negative and be evaluated and released to
duty by the Mayor before returning to work. Employees may be subject to
monitored random urine testing during the period of their re-entry contract.
      (6)   Employee requested testing. Any employee who questions the results
of a required test under subsections (f)(l) through (f)(5) hereof may request
that an additional test be conducted. This test may be conducted at the same or
a different testing laboratory, provided the laboratory is certified by DHHS to
meet 29 CFR Part 40 requirements. The testing shall be conducted on the same
specimen originally submitted to the Village's laboratory and all costs for
such testing are paid by the employee.
   (g)   Employee Assistance. It is the Village's policy to provide assistance
to employees and immediate family members who experience personal problems,
including substance abuse or dependency, which may adversely affect job
performance. Employees are encouraged to voluntarily seek assistance in dealing
with emotional, physical or mental health problems, including substance abuse.
Confidential professional assistance, treatment planning and rehabilitation
services are available, as needed. In an instance where a management referral
is made, confidentiality means that only the employee assistance program
coordinator and the referring supervisor shall be aware of the circumstances of
the referral.
   A request for assistance for a substance abuse problem shall not, in itself,
be considered grounds for disciplinary action. However, a request for
assistance shall not prevent the taking of appropriate disciplinary actions for
misconduct or performance problems which may be related to substance abuse. In
no case shall participation in the employee assistance program shield employees
who violate this policy from disciplinary action. Employees remain responsible
for their on-the-job conduct and work performance, although assistance for
substance abuse problems may be handled as a separate but related issue.
   (h)   Re-entry Contracts. Employees who re-enter the workforce shall agree
to a reentry contract. That contract may include, but is not limited to:
      (1)   A release to work statement from an approved treatment specialist.
(The medical review officer shall also approve the employee for return to work
in a sensitive safety position);
      (2)   A negative test for drugs and/or alcohol;
      (3)   An agreement to periodic testing;
      (4)   A statement of expected work-related behaviors; and
(5)   An agreement to follow specified after-care requirements with the
understanding that violation of the re-entry contract is grounds for
termination.

chooses, but receipts must support reimbursement.
         C.   On a single day of travel, an employee may be eligible for
reimbursement of actual meal expenses up to a maximum of forty-one dollars
($41.00).
         D.   Meal reimbursement will be made for actual expenditures only.
These amounts are not per diems or entitlements. Gratuities will be reimbursed
in additional to the meal allowance provided they do not exceed the lesser of
15% of the allowable meal expenses or five dollars ($5.00) per day maximum
gratuity reimbursement. All expenditures exceeding the daily maximum of forty-
one dollars ($41.00) are the sole responsibility of the employee.

fee included meal provisions, employees may not file for reimbursement of those
meal expenses or forego pre-paid meals and file for reimbursement of meal
expenses incurred as a substitute.

the conference or seminar such as public transportation, car rental, parking
fees, cab fares and tips not to exceed fifteen percent to cab drivers for
transportation between a hotel and the conference, and books or supplies for

employee shall complete Form TE-1. Itemized receipts for “actual” expenses must
be included indicating what was purchased and the reasons for the expenses
incurred.
      (7)   Local expenses. Local expenses required for the furtherance of
official Village business by the Mayor, Council members, department heads and
division heads are authorized, excluding the purchase of alcoholic beverages,
for themselves and guests in local restaurants and meeting facilities. Such
expenses shall be submitted with an itemized receipt which includes line items
indicating what was purchased and the reasons for the expenses incurred.
      (8)   Travel advance. Travel advances may be granted upon approval of
Form TE-1. When submitting Form TE-1, if any funds are to be returned to the
Village or if money is due to the employee, all information shall be recorded
in the proper columns.
      (9)   Reimbursements rejected in whole or in part by the Treasurer’s

   The Village encourages all employees to assist in the effort to achieve
equal opportunity in the workplace. Violations of this policy may be cause for
disciplinary action, including termination.

181.05 ALLOCATION OF TAX.
   (a)    In the taxation of income which is subject to the Municipal income
tax, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession
both within and without the boundaries of the Municipality shall disclose with
reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is attributable to that part
of the business or profession conducted within the boundaries of the
Municipality, then only that portion shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the Municipality for the purposes of Municipal income taxation, The
portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer to be allocated as having been
derived from within the Municipality, in the absence of actual records thereof,
shall be determined as follows: Multiply the entire net profits by a business
allocation percentage to be determined by a three-factor formula of property,
payroll, and sales, each of which shall be given equal weight, as follows:
      (1)    The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Municipal limits during the taxable period to the average net book value of all
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used in
this subsection, real property shall include property rented or leased by the
taxpayer, and the value of the property shall be determined by multiplying the
annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)    Wages, salaries and other compensations paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Municipal limits to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to persons employed in the business or profession wherever
their services are performed.
      (3)    Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Municipality to gross
receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales and
services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce the result.
   (c)    As used in subsection (a) (3) hereof, "sales made in the
Municipality" means:
      (1)    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Municipal limits, regardless of where title passes, if shipped or delivered
from a stock of goods within the Municipality.
      (2)    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Municipality, regardless of where title passes, even though transported
from a point outside the Municipality, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Municipality, and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (3)    All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Municipality to purchasers outside of the Municipality,
regardless of where title passes, if the taxpayer is not, through its own
employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place where delivery is made.
      
   (d)    (1)    Add togther the percentage determined in accordance with
subsection (a)(1), (2) and (3), or such of the aforesaid percentages as are
applicable to the particular taxpayer, and divide the total so obtained by the
number of percentages used in deriving the total, in order to obtain the
business allocation percentage referred to above.
      (2)    A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in
or outside the Municipal limits.
         (Ord. 1967-02. Passed 5-17-67.)
   (e)    (1)    Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities under Section
181.01 (c), (d) and (e), only if and to the extent that the rental ownership,
management, or operations of real estate from which the rentals are derived,
whether so rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through
agents or other representatives, constitutes a business activity of the
taxpayer in whole or in part.
      (2)    Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties,
regardless of number and value, aggregates in excess of one hundred twenty-five
dollars ($125.00) per month, it shall be prima facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management, or operation of the properties is a business activity of
the taxpayer, and the net income of the rental property shall be subject to
tax. However, in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or
fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts, or profits of the
lessee, whether or not the rental exceeds one hundred twenty-five dollars
($125.00) per month. In the case of farm property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in crops or when the
rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from the
farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds the one hundred twenty-five
dollars ($125.00) per month. A person who operates a licensed rooming house
shall be considered in business whether or not the gross income exceeds one
hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) per month.
      (3)    Property owners who are considered to have a business activity
under the provisions of this section shall submit or cause to be submitted to
the administrator a list of names and addresses of all persons, firms,
corporations, or other entities occupying, leasing, or renting any premises
belonging to the property owner within this Municipality. The required list
shall be prepared as of December 31, of each year and submitted on or before
January 31, of the following year.

   (f)    (1)    The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable
year subsequent to January 1, 1967, allocable to the Municipality may be
applied against the portion of the profit of succeeding tax years allocable to
the Municipality until exhausted, but in no event for more than five taxable
years immediately following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of
a net operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior
year.
      (2)    The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the Municipality in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net
profits to the Municipality.
      (3)    The administrator shall provide by rules and regulations the
manner in which the net operating-loss carry-forward shall be determined.
         (Ord. 1967-02. Passed 5-17-67.)
   (g)    (1)    Royalty income. Income earned by a taxpayer from a royalty
interest in the production of an oil or gas well whether managed, extracted or
operated by the taxpayer individually or through an agent or other
representative, shall be included in the computation of net profits from a
business activity to the extent that such royalty interest constitutes a
business activity of the taxpayer. Where the gross income received by a
taxpayer from a royalty interest in the production of an oil or gas well in a
taxable year exceeds three thousand dollars ($3,000), it shall be prima- facie
evidence that the income was derived from a business activity of such taxpayer
and the net income from such royalty interest shall be subject to tax.
      (2)    Employer's income. The employer's income derived from finance and
carrying charges associated with his customers’ accounts receivable shall also
be included in the computation of net profits.
   (h)    (1)    The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable
year subsequent to January l, 1967, allocable to the Municipality may be
applied against the portion of the profit of succeeding tax years allocable to
the Municipality until exhausted, but in no event for more than five taxable
years immediately following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of
a net operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior
year.
      (2)    The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the Municipality in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net
profits to the Municipality.
      (3)    The administrator shall provide by rules and regulations the
manner in which the net operating-loss carry-forward shall be determined.
         (Ord. 1990-40. Passed 5-16-90.)

181.08 PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)    The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of filing thereof,
pay to the administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon; however,
where:
      (1)    Any portion of the tax so due shall have been deducted at the
source pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.09;
      (2)    Any portion of the tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer

Municipality, credit for the amount so deducted or paid, or credit to the
extent provided for in Section

balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.
   (b)    A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the

interest and penalty, jointly and severally, for failure to file the employer's
return or to pay the employer's tax, interest and penalty as required under

change, discharges its managers from liability for the employee’s or manager's
failure to remit funds held in trust, to file a tax return or to pay taxes.

and regulations and amendments thereto, of this Chapter
181  as they existed before January 1, 2016. Ordinance 2015-68 does not repeal

          (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)
(1) of this Section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in Woodmere Village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of Woodmere Village may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
                  (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment
method shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed

vendor, customer, client, or patient.
                  (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing,
investigation, inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative,
judicial, or legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that
the compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the
employer or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly
benefits the employer;
                  (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator
determines that the employer directed the employee to perform the services at
the other location in lieu of a location described in division (F)(3)(a) or (b)
of this Section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal
income tax liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the

the evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

Village to purchasers outside Woodmere Village, provided that the taxpayer is
not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or

which the tangible personal property is used in Woodmere Village.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to Woodmere Village's tax only if the

Village to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real
estate everywhere in the taxable year.
                  (b)    An individual who is a resident of Woodmere Village
shall report the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the
individual's annual tax return for Woodmere Village. The individual may claim a

Withholding provisions.
   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in Woodmere Village shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying
wages earned and/or received by each employee in Woodmere Village. Except for
qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under Section
 181.21 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this Section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section B(1) of this Chapter, of two and a half percent
(2.5%.) An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and
withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or
other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages
to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
    (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this Section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of Woodmere Village the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator, (the Village's third party tax administrator
currently is the Regional Income Tax Agency), if the total taxes deducted and
withheld or required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer on behalf of Woodmere Village in the preceding calendar year
exceeded $2,399, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of Woodmere Village in any month
of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200.
Payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this Section shall be made to the Tax
Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month for which
the tax was withheld.
                (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this Section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax

required to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal
taxes withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal
Revenue Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation,
the payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator
of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of Woodmere Village. The payment
of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an
employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required
under this Section.
          (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make
and file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and Woodmere Village as the
return required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax
under this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer.
          (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not
required to withhold Woodmere Village income tax with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of
either the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued
or of such corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
                 (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer to remit to Woodmere Village the tax withheld relieves the employee
from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
          (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
Woodmere Village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent
the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
          (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required
to withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Woodmere Village until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
          (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an
employer shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax
Administrator listing:

all employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Woodmere Village during the preceding calendar year;

employee, the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the
preceding calendar year;
                  (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for
which tax was withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during
the preceding calendar year;
                  (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax
reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form
with respect to such employee;
                  (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax
Administrator.
          (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this Section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this Section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
           (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold Woodmere
Village income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees
and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
          (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this Section.

corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this Section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a

          (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this Section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
          (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this
Section, if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends
performing personal services in Woodmere Village exceeds the 20-day threshold,

employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to
Woodmere Village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of Woodmere Village.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable

respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of Woodmere Village a copy of each
information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
         (f)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and
remit the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount
deducted and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any
penalty and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late
payment of tax deducted and withheld.
      (6)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (7)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold
the required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person
from liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
      (8)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this Section, the Tax
Administrator for Woodmere Village may impose the following applicable penalty:
         (a)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted
and withheld under this Section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
         (b)    For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or
annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or
filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at
the rate prescribed in Section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (9)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of Woodmere Village shall
be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by Woodmere Village
and shall be treated as taxes paid. This division applies only to the person
for whom the amount is deducted and withheld.
        (10)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts
and returns required under this Section.
         (Ord. 2018-11. Passed 2-14-18.)
181.23  ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual Woodmere Village income tax return shall be completed and
filed by every individual taxpayer eighteen (18) years of age or older and any
taxpayer that is not an individual for each taxable year for which the taxpayer
is subject to the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
           (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
181.22 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due Woodmere Village.
           (2)    Retirees having no municipal taxable income for Woodmere
Village income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written
exemption from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax
Administrator. The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and
the entity from which retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time
as the retiree receives municipal taxable income taxable to the Woodmere
Village, at which time the retiree shall be required to comply with all
applicable provisions of this Chapter.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by Woodmere Village, the return or notice required of that individual
shall be completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent,
guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the
person or property of that individual.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.
   (E)    Woodmere Village shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
            (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in
the case of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation,
Ohio form IT-1040; and, with respect to
an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to support the
adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the
annual return required by this Section electronically is not required to
provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
             (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this Section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
             (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator
may request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by Woodmere Village to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this Section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this Section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to Woodmere Village. No remittance
is required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
         (b)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this Section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day (15th) of the fourth month following the end of
the taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the Woodmere Village. No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
            (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of Woodmere Village's income
tax return. The extended due date of Woodmere Village's income tax return shall
be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is
not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator
grants an extension of that date.
                  (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be
included with the filing of Woodmere Village's income tax return.
                  (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-
month extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit
a written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's Woodmere Village income tax
return. If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the
date the Woodmere Village income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall
grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
           (3)    If the State of Ohio tax commissioner extends for all
taxpayers the date for filing state income tax returns under division (G) of
Section 5747.08 of the ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension
for the filing of Woodmere Village's income tax return. The extended due date
of Woodmere Village's income tax return shall be the same as the extended due
date of the state income tax return.
           (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by Woodmere Village, the Tax
Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise
than as provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required
to file annual returns.
           (5)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
Section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
Section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, Woodmere Village shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net
amount due is ten dollars or less.
            (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to Woodmere Village
for a taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this Section shall file with
Woodmere Village an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this
Section, unless the provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
             (3)   (a)    A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the
person does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to Woodmere Village income tax
ordinance for a taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)    The person was required to file a tax return with Woodmere
Village for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 4(C)(1)(g)) within
Woodmere Village.
             (ii)    The person no longer provides services in Woodmere Village
and does not expect to be subject to Woodmere Village income tax for the
taxable year.
         (b)    The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within Woodmere Village. The affidavit shall also
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within Woodmere Village, make any sales in Woodmere Village, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by Woodmere Village during the
taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by Woodmere
Village for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer
and to properly comply as a taxpayer with Woodmer Village income tax ordinance
and rules and regulations." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty
of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)    Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   If a payment under this Chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the Woodmere Village by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
181.22 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by Woodmere Village, unless the amounts withheld were
not remitted to Woodmere Village and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by Woodmere Village to be filed in accordance
with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by Woodmere Village, provided
that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by Woodmere Village or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or
tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the
provisions of this Chapter and of Woodmere Village's ordinance, resolution, or
rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file Woodmere
Village's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
            (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may
report the amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and
may make remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
           (3)    Nothing in this Section affects the due dates for filing
employer withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the National Guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of Woodmere
Village for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension
of time for payment of taxes required by Woodmere Village during the period of
the member's or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The
application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the
member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such
evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this Section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
           (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this Section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the Woodmere Village before the 181st day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
           (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1)
of this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
    (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in
this division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this Section.
           (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by Woodmere Village in
accordance with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this Section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
National Guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
                 (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with
division (P)(2)(a) of this Section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (G)(2)(a) of
this Section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)   For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
Section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this Section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)   As used in this Section:
           (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group
as defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
           (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the

purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this Section.
           (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.

Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Woodmere
Village's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this Section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
           (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal
income tax returns under this Section must be made in the first year following
the last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this Section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
           (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this Section
is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Woodmere Village income tax return for that taxable year if
the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to Woodmere Village. A taxpayer that is required to
file a consolidated Woodmere Village income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Woodmere Village income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission
from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
    (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Woodmere Village income tax
return in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this Section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
 181.20, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
           (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated Woodmere Village income
tax return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section 2 (C)(1)
to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the
adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
           (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Woodmere Village income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
181.23, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Woodmere Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
181.23, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Woodmere Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
            (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having
less than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
 181.23, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Woodmere Village;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to Woodmere Village
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Woodmere Village income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
181.23 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that Section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that Section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Woodmere Village income tax
return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by Woodmere Village in accordance with this
Chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with Woodmere Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with Woodmere Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016. (Ord. 2018-
11. Passed 2-14-18.)
181.24 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in Woodmere Village who is
required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this Chapter may
claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the
other municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall
not exceed the tax due Woodmere Village under this Chapter.  
   (B)    Woodmere Village shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of Woodmere Village who works in a joint economic development zone
created under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it
grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this Section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)    Intentionally left blank.
(Ord. 2018-11. Passed 2-14-18.)
181.25  ESTIMATED TAXES.

   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this Section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for Woodmere Village from qualifying wages shall
be considered as paid to the Woodmere Village in equal amounts on each payment
date unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were
actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates
on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
           (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations
of estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed

           (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
       (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this Section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to Woodmere Village,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    Effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018,
for an individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the first month of
the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the
taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or before the fifteenth
(15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year.
           (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
           (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of
the year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was

be paid with the return in accordance with Section
181.23.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section 18 upon the
amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless the underpayment
is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of this Section. The
amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date

            (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this Section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this Section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this Section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
           (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
           (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
one hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the
taxpayer for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately
preceding taxable year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer
filed a return with Woodmere Village under Section
181.23 for that year.
           (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Woodmere Village
but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year
that includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 2018-11. Passed 2-14-18.)
181.26 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 2018-11. Passed 2-14-18.)
181.27 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this Section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
181.36.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this Section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by Woodmere Village:
           (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
           (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten
dollars or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (C)(3) of this Section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
           (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
 181.39. 
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this Section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
           (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the
earliest postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed
is not later than the last day for filing the request.
           (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only
postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private
postal meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for
filing the request, and the request is received within seven days of such last
day.
           (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark
date was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of
the postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within
seven days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
181.36(A)(4).
(Ord. 2018-11. Passed 2-14-18.)
181.28  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with Woodmere Village, but should
have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by Woodmere Village
as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
    (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with Woodmere Village is subject to recovery by Woodmere
Village. If Woodmere Village's tax on that income is imposed after the time
period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other
municipality, Woodmere Village shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the
tax or withholding that Woodmere Village claims is due, with respect to such
income or wages equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality
with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)    If Woodmere Village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using Woodmere
Village's tax rate. However, if Woodmere Village's tax rate is greater than the
tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to Woodmere Village, along with any penalty and interest
that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this Section permits any credit carryforward.   
(Ord. 2018-11. Passed 2-14-18.)
181.29 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for Woodmere Village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with Woodmere Village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by
the Tax Administrator.
           (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated
municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate
return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal
income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before
filing the amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
181.30 has not expired for a previously filed return.
            (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of
tax that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
    (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by Woodmere Village. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
181.27.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Woodmere Village tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Woodmere Village return showing income
subject to Woodmere Village income tax based upon such final determination of
federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Woodmere
Village income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars.
(Ord. 2018-11. Passed 2-14-18.)
181.30 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
                (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was
filed, whichever is later; or
                (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying
deferral period, if any.
                  (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this
Section may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the
employer, agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to
the extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the
time limit described in division (C) of this Section.
   (2)   As used in this Section, "qualifying deferral period" means a period
of time beginning and ending as follows:
                (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
181.39. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
181.27. 
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Woodmere Village does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
           (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
181.27, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
181.27. 
   (E)    No civil action to recover Woodmere Village income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
           (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
           (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition
of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2018-11. Passed 2-14-18.)
181.31 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
    (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this Section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this Section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2018-11. Passed 2-14-18.)
181.32 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this Section:
           (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator
has at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address
the Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
           (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this Section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this Section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
    (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an
undeliverable address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to
ascertain a new last known address, including the use of a change of address
service offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under
Section 5703.056 of the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a
new last known address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and
considered served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after
the assessment's postmark.
                   (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Woodmere Village
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Woodmere Village Board of Tax Review
within 60 days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of
the Tax Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this Section is prima facie
evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
           (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by
certified mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address,
the Tax Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The
assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and
include the following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
Section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this Section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this Section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this Section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
Section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
           (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis
described in division (D)(1) of this Section, and if that assessment is subject
to collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Woodmere
Village official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this
division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Board of Tax Review of Woodmere Village.
   (E)    Nothing in this Section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this Section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this Section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2018-11. Passed 2-14-18.)
181.33  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this Section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to Woodmere Village that arises pursuant to Woodmere Village's income tax
imposed in accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of Woodmere
Village:
           (1)    Compromise a claim;
           (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a
claim by agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2018-11. Passed 2-14-18.)
181.34  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of Woodmere Village
as authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit Woodmere Village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2018-11. Passed 2-14-18.)
181.35 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Woodmere Village Ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud Woodmere Village or the Tax
Administrator.

the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
Woodmere Village to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be

   (C)    Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

   (A)    Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax

court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
                  (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this

            (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

            (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the
manner authorized by law;
            (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the

Verification of accuracy of returns and determination of liability.
   
   (B)   (1)    A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee
thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this Section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
      (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by Woodmere Village or for the withholding of such
tax.
             (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person
that the Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any
income that was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction
tending to affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose,
compel any such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such
person's possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
            (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this Section
shall fail to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
            (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for
identifying information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid
identifying information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this
Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person
to whom the request was directed pursuant to Section
181.36, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
181.991.
                   (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a
change with respect to that information as required under division (C) of
Section
181.37 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
181.36. 
                 (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a)
and (b) of this Section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax
or fee with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in
addition to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
99 for a violation of Section
181.35 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law. (Ord. 2018-11. Passed 2-14-18.)
181.38 REQUEST FOR OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.

Administrator in accordance with the Rules and Regulations.
   (C)    A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (D)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this Section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.
   (E)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this Section is not
subject to appeal. (Ord. 2018-11. Passed 2-14-18.)

members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of Woodmere Village,
but such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with Woodmere Village at any time during their term or in the five years (which
applies only to these two appointments) immediately preceding the date of
appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor of Woodmere Village.
This member may be an employee of Woodmere Village, but may not be the Director
of Finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar
official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any
direct subordinate thereof.
            (2)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review for Woodmere
Village shall be two years. There is no limit on the number of terms that a
member may serve if the member is reappointed by the legislative authority. The
board member appointed by the Mayor of Woodmere Village shall serve at the
discretion of the administrative official.
            (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the
legislative authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority
vote for malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a
member, the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges
against the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in
person or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days'
notice. The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and
not appealable.
            (4)    A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason,
ceases to meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this Section
shall resign immediately by operation of law.
             (5)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same
manner as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was
created. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the
expiration of the term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall
hold office for the remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax
Review shall impair the power and authority of the remaining members to
exercise all the powers of the Board of Tax Review.
            (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of
Tax Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason,
the legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the
member shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of
Tax Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall
be subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
Section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this Section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this Section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.
(Ord. 2018-11. Passed 2-14-18.)
181.40  AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS.

183.01 USE OF COLLECTED FUNDS.
   The Treasurer is hereby instructed to deposit all moneys received from the
five (5) percent admissions tax into the General Fund to be distributed by
appropriation to the individual funds as deemed to be in the best interest of
the community as determined by Council.
(Ord. 2004-04. Passed 1-21-04.)
183.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter
   (a)    "Admission charge" means the charge made for the right or privilege
to enter into a place, or the charge or fee paid for the use of any facilities
or grounds including, but not limited to, the amount charged or paid as annual
membership dues to any club or organization, or charge or fee charged or paid
to use any facilities for a season or longer, provided, however, that if such
charge includes rental of property or for a service such rental or service
charge shall be taken to be an admission charge. If a lesser charge is made to
persons who do not desire to use the property, facilities or services offered,
the lesser charge shall constitute the admission charge. The designation of a
charge as a rental or service charge, or fee of any kind, shall not be
construed to avoid the application of the tax if it is in effect a charge for
admission.
   (b)    "Treasurer" means the Treasurer and Tax Administrator of the
Municipality.
   (c)    "Place" includes, but is not restricted to, theaters, dance halls,
night clubs, amphitheaters, auditoriums, stadiums, athletic pavilions and
fields, golf courses, baseball and athletic parks, circuses, side shows,
swimming pools, outdoor amusement parks and such attractions as merry-go-
rounds, Ferris wheels, dodgems, roller coasters and observation towers owned or
operation by any person.
   (d)    "Person" means any individual, receiver, assignee, firm,
copartnership, joint venture, corporation, company, joint stock company, park
board, municipal corporation, public authority created by statute of Ohio,
association, society or any group of individuals acting as a unit, whether
mutual, cooperative, fraternal, nonprofit or otherwise.
      (Ord. 2004-04. Passed 1-21-04.)
183.03  LEVY AND AMOUNT OF TAX.
   There is hereby levied upon every person who pays an admission charge to any
place which is entirely or partially located within the Village:
   (a)    A tax of five percent (5%) of the admission charge paid for admission
to any place, including admission by fee for the privilege of using any
facility. The tax shall apply to every admission charge to any place which is
entirely or partially located within the Village, notwithstanding that the sale
of the ticket or other evidence of right of admission is made outside the
Village.
   (b)    A tax of five percent (5%) of the admission charge paid for admission
to any public performance for profit at any night club, cabaret or other
similar entertainment in case the charge for admission is in the form of a
service charge or cover charge or other similar charge.
   (c)    A tax of five percent (5%) on the excess of the amounts paid for
tickets or cards of admission to theaters, operas and other places of
amusement, sold at newsstands, hotels and places other than the ticket office
of such theaters, operas or other places of amusement, over and above the
amounts representing the established price therefor at such ticket offices,
such tax to be returned and paid in the manner provided in Section
183.05 by the person selling the ticket.
   (d)    If a place is not entirely located within the Village, the Treasurer
shall determine the percentage of the admissions charge attributable to the
portion of the place located within the Village. In making such determination,
the Treasurer shall consider appropriate factors such as the percentage of the
place's recreational and business activity which is conducted within the
Village. Alternatively, the Village and the facility in question which is not
located entirely within the Village may, by agreement, determine the
appropriate amount of admissions tax by agreement. Such agreement shall be
approved by the Treasurer, ratified by Council, and shall reflect both parties'
understanding that the alternative method agreed upon is a reasonable
determination of the admissions tax to be levied upon that "place" as it is not
entirely located within the Village.
(Ord. 2004-04. Passed 1-21-04.)
183.04  EXEMPTIONS.
   No tax shall be levied under this chapter with respect to any admission, all
the proceeds which inure:
   (a)    Exclusively to the benefit of religious, educational or charitable
organizations located in the Village, provided no part of the earnings thereof
inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual.
   (b)    Exclusively to the benefit of persons in the military or naval forces
of the United States, or of National Guard organizations, reserve officer
associations or posts or organizations of war veterans, or auxiliary units or
societies of any such posts or organizations, if such posts, organizations,
units or societies are organized in the State, and if no part of their net
earnings inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual.
   (c)    Exclusively to the benefit of members of the police or fire
departments of any municipal corporation, or the dependents or heirs of such
members.
   (d)    Exclusively to the benefit of the general revenue fund of any
municipal corporation or exclusively to the benefit of any fund of any
municipal corporation.
   (e)    Immediately after the event for which an exemption from the
admissions tax has been allowed, a responsible individual of the institution,
society or organization for whose benefit such even was held shall file an
itemized statement with the Treasurer setting forth the amount of money
actually received by the Treasurer of such institution, society or
organization, together with the expenses of promoting and conducting such
event. Such statement shall be used as a basis of subsequent requests for
exemption from the admissions tax for the benefit of such organization,
institution or society. If such statement shall be used as a basis of
subsequent requests for exemption from the admissions tax for the benefit of
such organization, institution or society. If such statement shows a
disproportionate expenditure for the promoting and conducting of such event in
relation to the profits, if any, no such exemption shall thereafter be allowed
to such institution, society or organization.
   (f)    The exemption from tax provided in this section shall not be allowed
to any institution, society or organization which does not control the sale of
admissions to the event for which the exemption is requested, nor shall any
exemption be allowed where talent, services or other items are compensated for
on a percentage basis if such percentage services or other items. The exemption
provided for shall be subject to the approval of the Treasurer.
      (Ord. 2004-04. Passed 1-21-04.)
183.05  COLLECTION, PAYMENT AND INTEREST.
   (a)    Every person receiving any payment on which a tax is levied under
this chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making
the admission payment. The tax required to be collected under this chapter
shall be deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the tax
until paid to the Treasurer as herein provided. Any person required to collect
the tax imposed under this chapter who fails to collect the tax, or having
collected the same, fails to remit such tax to the Treasurer in the manner
prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of his own act
of the result of acts or conditions beyond his control, shall nevertheless be
personally liable to the City for the amount of such tax and shall, unless the
remittance is made as herein required, be guilty of a violation of this
chapter.
   (b)    The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the time the
admission charge is paid by the person seeking admission to any place and shall
be reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the Treasurer in
monthly installments and remittance therefor on or before the last day of the
month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in which the tax is
collected or received.
   (c)    Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made by check,
unless payment or remittance is otherwise required by the Treasurer, but
payment by check shall not relieve the person collected the tax from liability
for payment and remittance of the tax to the Finance Director unless the check
is honored and is in the full or correct amount. The person receiving any
payment for admissions shall make out a return upon such forms setting forth
such information as the Treasurer may require, showing the amount of the tax
upon the admissions for which he is liable for the preceding monthly period,
and shall sign and transmit the same to the Treasurer with a remittance for
such amount, provided that the Treasurer may, in his discretion, require
verified annual returns from any person receiving admission payments setting
forth such additional information as he may deems necessary to determine
correctly the amount of tax collected and payable.
   (d)    Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition or amusement makes an
admission charge which is subject to the tax herein levied, and the same is of
a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Treasurer shall be the judge,
the Treasurer may require the report and remittance of the admissions tax
immediately upon the collection of the same at the conclusion of the
performance or exhibition, or at the conclusion of the series of performances
or exhibitions, or at such other times as the Treasurer shall determine.
Failure to comply with any requirement of the Treasurer as to report and
remittance of the tax as required shall be in violation of this chapter.
   (e)    Any book, record or account of any person collecting a tax herein
levied, which relates in any manner whatsoever to admission charges, tax
collections or the percentage of the admission charge attributable to the
portion of the place located within the City shall be subject to examination
and audit by the Finance Director at all reasonable times. If the tax imposed
by this chapter is not paid when due, there shall be added as part of the tax,
interest at the rate of one (1) percent from the time the tax became due until
paid.
(Ord. 2004-04. Passed 1-21-04.)
183.06  REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE; FEE.
   Any person conducting or operating any place for entrance to which an
admission charge is made, shall, on a form prescribed by the Treasurer, make
application to and procure from the Treasurer a Certificate of Registration,
the fee for which shall be ten dollars ($10.00), which Certificate shall
continue valid until December 31 of the year in which the same is issued. Such
certificate or duplicate original copies thereof shall be issued by the
Treasurer without additional charge and shall be posted in a conspicuous place
in each ticket or box office where tickets of admissions are sold.
(Ord. 2004-04. Passed 1-21-04.)
183.07 TEMPORARY REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE.
   Whenever a Certificate of Registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owners, lessees or custodians of the
building, lots or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in Section
183.05 by such owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person conducting
the place. The applicant for a Certificate of Registration for such purpose
shall furnish with the application therefor the name and address of the owner,
lessee or custodian shall be notified, by the Treasurer of such Certificate and
the joint liability for collection and remittance of such tax. (Ord. 2004-04.
Passed 1-21-04.)
183.08  AUTHORITY TO MAKE RULES, REGULATIONS.
   The Treasurer is hereby authorized to adopt rules and regulations not
inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out and enforcing the
payment, collection and remittance of the tax herein levied. A copy of such
rules and regulations shall be published by posting in those places designated
by Council for posting public notices at the office of the Treasurer. Failure
or refusal to comply with any such rules and regulations shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter. (Ord. 2004-04. Passed 1-21-04.)
183.09  EFFECTIVE DATE.
   The taxes herein levied and imposed shall be collected and paid on or after
January 21,
2004. (Ord. 2004-04. Passed 1-21-04.)

   Appeals from any ruling of the Treasurer shall be made to Council, and
Council shall have authority to annul, modify or affirm any such ruling
appealed from, in conformity with the intent and purpose of this chapter.

183.11 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   All returns and information relating to the business of any person required
to collect the tax imposed by this chapter and coming into the possession of
the Treasurer or his agents and employees, shall be held confidential. No
disclosures thereof shall be made unless ordered by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
(Ord. 2004-04. Passed 1-21-04.)

collecting or paying the taxes imposed by this chapter, shall willfully fail or

Treasurer as required by this chapter, or to permit the Treasurer or his duly

in such manner as the Director of Finance may deem best to obtain facts and
information on which to base the estimate of the tax due. As soon as the

assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any vendor who has
failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance,

and penalties, if any, determined by the Director of Finance, shall become
final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is
made, the Director of Finance shall give not less than five (5) days written
notice in the manner prescribed herein to the vendor to show cause at a time
and place fixed in such notice why such amount specified therein should not be
fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the vendor may
appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should
not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Director of Finance shall determine
the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the
person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of
such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be
payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is taken as provided in
Section
185.12 . (Ord. 2007-21. Passed 3-21-07.)
   185.12  APPEALS.

to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the
Mayor by filing a notice of appeal with the Mayor within fifteen (15) days of
the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Mayor shall fix a
time and place for hearing such appeal, and shall give notice in writing to
such vendor at the vendor’s last known place of address. The findings of the
Mayor shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in
the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found
to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.
(Ord. 2007-21. Passed 3-21-07.)
   185.13  RECORDS; INSPECTION.
   Every vendor liable for the collection and payment to the Village of any tax
imposed by this chapter shall keep and preserve, for a period of three (3)

at all reasonable times.

received by the Village under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
subsections (b) and (c) hereof, provided a claim in writing therefore, stating
under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded,
is filed with the Director of Finance within three (3) years of the date of
payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Director of Finance.
   (b)    A vendor may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected
and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or
illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed
by the Director of Finance that the person from whom the tax has been collected
was not a transient guest. However, neither a refund nor a credit shall be
allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to
the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient
to the vendor.
   (c)    A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Village by
filing of a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) hereof, but only
when the tax was paid by the transient guest directly to the Director of
Finance, or when the transient guest having paid the tax to the vendor,
establishes to the satisfaction of the Director of Finance that the transient
guest has been unable to obtain a refund from the vendor who collected the tax.

thereto.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.

private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private

as a private tow- away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may

that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the

state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall

nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.

vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be

substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of

shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish

to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

   (c)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an “abandoned junk
motor vehicle” as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 upon or within the right of way
of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without notification

303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5)
that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.

   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   (b)   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (c)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05 , pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
 313.05  or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
      (ORC 4511.131)
313.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

313.07 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)   No person shall place, maintain or display upon or in view of any
street any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device which purports to be,
is an imitation of or resembles a traffic control device or railroad sign or
signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from view
or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit upon any street any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to streets of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic
control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.211 and
4511.432.
   (b)   Every such prohibited sign, signal, marking or device is a public

331.01 DRIVING UPON RIGHT SIDE OF ROADWAY; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right of way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic control
device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;
         C.   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the
right-hand lane to continue on the driver’s intended route.
      (2)   Nothing in subsection (b)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or
except as permitted under subsection (a) (2) hereof.
   Subsection (c) hereof shall not be construed as prohibiting the crossing of
the center line in making a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway.
   (d)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section

an auxiliary yellow line marked on the roadway pavement and placed parallel to
the normal center line or marked lane line. When the auxiliary yellow line
appears on the left side in the driver's lane of travel and to the right of the
normal center line or marked lane line, no driver shall drive across the
auxiliary yellow line to overtake and pass another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction. When auxiliary yellow lines appear on both sides of the normal
center line or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction shall
not drive across such auxiliary yellow lines to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction. No driver shall, at any other time,
drive across the yellow auxiliary line when it appears in the driver's lane of
travel, except to make a lawfully permitted left-hand turn under the rules
governing such movement. No passing signs may also be erected facing traffic to
indicate the beginning and end of each no passing zone.
   When appropriate signs or markings indicating hazardous or no passing zones

allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is
proceeding and is posted with signs to give notice of such allocation.
      (3)   Official signs may be erected directing specified traffic to use a
designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction regardless of the center of the roadway, and drivers of
vehicles shall obey the directions of such signs.

phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field

prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.
            (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.

section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a

under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term.
   The court may impose a jail term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail
term or intervention program. However, in no case shall the cumulative jail
term imposed for the offense exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.    
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and

determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99 , a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).

commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. (ORC 4511.19)

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,

As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be

motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial

the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for

seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident

4510.02.

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets. “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima-facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a

ownership of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor
vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed
or movable signs.

the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that

   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the

         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;

      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.

delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. (ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.

501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the

substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,

commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this

high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This

or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or

      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.

   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.

only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.

a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged

when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evalute such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:

division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:

offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 Type of Misdemeanor                         Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.

subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the

offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of

involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender's same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

Village, a nuisance or public nuisance means any deterioration of structural
materials or lack of repair or maintenance that is a hazard to the health,

or long lasting effect upon the public right, an effect of which the actor is
aware or should be aware.
(Ord. 2014-106. Passed 11-12-14.)
 
551.02 AUTHORITY OF VILLAGE OFFICIALS.
   Whenever there shall be done or exist within the Village any act, thing, or
condition of a kind which has been or may hereafter be defined by ordinance as
a nuisance, the Mayor or the Building Inspector is authorized and directed
promptly to cause its abatement as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 2014-106. Passed 11-12-14.)
 
551.03 ABATEMENT OF CERTAIN NUISANCES WITHOUT DECLARATION OF VILLAGE COUNCIL:
NOTICE TO OWNER OF REAL ESTATE.
   (a)    The following procedures shall apply to the abatement of noxious or
poison weeds or tall grass:
      (1)    Any noxious or poison weeds or tall grass growing upon a parcel of
land and/or any abutting treelawn that is six (6) inches or higher in height is
a threat to human health and public safety and constitutes a nuisance. It shall
be the responsibility of each owner of property within the City to maintain
their property and abutting treelawns in a manner that prevents such nuisances.
If the owner does not cut or destroy, or cause to be cut or destroyed, the
poison or noxious weeds or tall grasses as required herein, the Mayor or
Building Inspector is authorized to cause said nuisance to be cut or destroyed.
Such abatement may be issued by the Mayor or Building Inspector or both without
reporting same to Council following the procedures set forth in this Section.
For the purposes of this Section, a "treelawn" shall be defined as the
landscaped area between the sidewalk and the paved portion of a street.
      (2)    The owner of any parcel of land determined to be in violation of
this Section shall be served a written notice upon the first identified
violation per calendar year. Such notice shall state that the owner has two (2)
calendar days to cut or destroy, or cause to be cut or destroyed, any noxious
or poisonous weeds or tall grass. Further, the notice shall conspicuously state
that failure to comply after service of said notice will result in the Village
causing the work to be done and the costs to be assessed against the property
in the manner provided by this Section. The notice shall also conspicuously
state that any subsequent violations of this Section concerning the same
property during the same calendar year shall require no further notice.
      (3)    When it is deemed necessary to cut and destroy weeds or grass, in
accordance with the provisions of this Section, the owner shall be charged at
the rate of two hundred dollars ($200.00) per hour or portion thereof, or the
actual cost of the work, whichever is larger. The minimum charge shall be two
hundred dollars ($200.00). After such work is performed, the Village shall give
thirty (30) days written notice by regular mail to the owner to pay the cost of
such cutting or destroying of the weeds or grass, which notice shall be
accompanied by an order to pay and a statement of the amount of costs incurred
and an explanation of the appeals process set forth in Section
551.08 herein. If the same is not paid or appealed within thirty (30) days
after the mailing of the notice and order, such amount may be certified to the
County Fiscal Officer for collection as other taxes and assessments are
collected or the Village may seek recovery of such costs by civil action
against the property owner involved.
 
   (b)    The following procedures shall apply to the abatement of nuisances
involving sidewalks, landscaping, unsecured vacant property, or abandoned
unusable personal property or other debris:
      (1)    The Mayor or Building Inspector, upon finding that a nuisance
exists in matters involving sidewalks, landscaping, unsecured vacant property,
or abandoned unusable personal property or other debris may cause written
notice or order to be served on the owner of the real estate. The notice or
order shall set forth the nature of the nuisance, the estimate of the cost of
abating the same if done by the Village, a reasonable time determined by the
Mayor or Building Inspector within which the owner shall abate the nuisance or
pay the estimated cost to the Village, and the statement that unless the
nuisance is abated within the stated time it may be abated by the Village and
the cost of abatement assessed on the real estate involved, and the Village may
prosecute the owner for failure to comply with the order.
      (2)    Such notice or order of abatement may be issued by the Mayor or
Building Inspector or both without reporting same to Council. In case the
Village abates the nuisance and the cost is not paid within the time fixed by
the Mayor or Building Inspector, the Mayor or Building Inspector shall report
the fact to Council which may assess the same on the real estate from which the
nuisance originated.
(Ord. 2014-106. Passed 11-12-14.)
 
551.04 ABATEMENT OF OTHER NUISANCES.
   (a)    If the Mayor or Building Inspector finds the existence of any
nuisance other than those enumerated in Section
551.03, such official shall report such facts to Council which may thereupon
declare such condition, building or structure a nuisance. The Council may
specify, upon the advice of the Mayor or Building Inspector, what reasonable
activities, repairs or maintenance are necessary to abate such nuisance
including, but not limited to, revocation of a Certificate of Occupancy.
 
   (b)    Upon such finding and declaring, the Mayor or Building Inspector may
proceed in the manner provided in Section
551.03 for the abatement of nuisances.
(Ord. 2014-106. Passed 11-12-14.)
 
551.05 SERVICE OF NOTICE.
   The notice may be served by delivering it personally to the owner or leaving
it at the owner's usual place of business or residence, or by posting it in a
conspicuous place on the real estate, building or structure involved, or by
mailing it to the owner, or by publishing it once in a newspaper of general
circulation within the Village if it cannot be served in any of the other ways
above mentioned.
(Ord. 2014-106. Passed 11-12-14.)

   (a)    Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file within
360 days of the alleged violation with the Board a complaint in writing, sworn
to or affirmed, which shall state the name and address of the person alleged to
have committed the violation complained of and the particulars thereof, and
such other information as may be required by the Board. The Board may also
corroborate or initiate complaints on the basis of testing carried out by its
staff or volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)    Upon the filing of a complaint the executive secretary of the Board
shall make such investigation as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and
issues. If the executive secretary shall determine that there are reasonable
grounds to believe a violation has occurred, he shall attempt to conciliate the
matter by methods of initial conference and persuasion with all interested
parties and such representatives as the parties may choose to assist them.
Conciliation conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done during such
initial conference shall be made public by the Board or any member of the Board
or its staff unless the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (c)    The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced
to writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the
parties, which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not
constitute an admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent
agreements shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its chairman after prior
approval by the Director of Law.
   (d)    The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Board of Ohio Civil Rights Commission in any investigation under
this chapter.
   (e)    If the executive secretary determines that the complaint lacks
reasonable grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so
inform the Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or
order such further investigation as may be necessary provided, that the Board
shall not dismiss such complaint without first affording the complainant an
opportunity to appear before the Board.
   (f)    If the executive secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a
violation of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties
have in good faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal
conciliation agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a
complaint is not susceptible of conciliation, he shall notify the Board
immediately and the Board shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to
determine whether a violation of this chapter has been committed.
   The Board shall serve upon the respondent a statement of charges and a
summons and shall serve upon all interested parties a notice of the time and
place of hearing. The respondent or his authorized counsel may file such
statements with the Board prior to the hearing date as it deems necessary in
support of its position. The hearing shall be opened to the public, except that
the respondent may request in writing a private hearing; the determination of
such request shall be discretionary with the Board. The hearing shall be held
not less than fifteen days after service of the statement of charges and
summons. The summons so issued must be signed by two members of the Board and
the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of named persons and
the production of relevant documents and records. The failure to comply with a
summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The interested parties
may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or by duly authorized
representative and may have the assistance of an attorney. The parties may
present testimony and evidence, and the right to cross examine witnesses shall
be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be given under oath or by
affirmation. The Executive Secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing,
which record shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon
request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such
party a copy of the hearing record, if any, at such cost as the Board deems
appropriate.
   (g)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has
violated this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Law
Director in executive session, state its findings to and cause the Law Director
to prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person
complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take
such affirmative action as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, with
notice that if the Board determines that the person complained against has not
after fifteen calendar days following service of the Board's order complied
with the order, the Board will recertify the matter to the Law Director for
enforcement.
   Upon recertification to the Law Director for enforcement, she shall forward
the complaint to the Ohio Civil Rights Commission (OCRC) or the United States
Department of Justice, or advise the complaint of other private rights of
enforcement.
   (h)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon

preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained against
has not violated this chapter, the Board shall state and publish its findings
and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

921.12 GREASE INTERCEPTORS; INSTALLATION AND DISPOSAL OF WASTE.
   (a)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of this section is the regulation of the collection and
disposal of grease interceptor waste for the protection of the Village of
Woodmere (“Village”)-owned and Woodbran Realty Corporation (“Woodbran”)- owned
sanitary sewer system operating in the Village of Woodmere and the environment.
      (2)   The objective of this section is to reduce the operational
consequences and maintenance costs to the Village and Woodbran of maintaining
the sanitary sewer system by preventing the accumulation of grease within the
collection system lines.
      (3)   This section shall apply to the Village of Woodmere and to persons
outside the Village who, by contract, agreement or otherwise with the Village,
are users of the Village-owned sanitary sewer lines.
   (b)   Administration. The Village of Woodmere shall administer, implement,
and enforce the provisions of this regulation. The Village of Woodmere may
contact with the Cuyahoga County Board of Health to conduct inspections and
monitoring and to assist with enforcement actions.
   (c)   Applicability.
      (1)   Waste which contains grease shall be discharged into the sanitary
sewer system only under the conditions of this section. The following
facilities (collectively “Facilities” and individually a “Facility”) shall
discharge all waste from sinks, dishwashers, drains, and any other fixtures
through which grease may be discharged, into an adequately sized, properly
maintained and functioning grease interceptor before the discharge enters the
sanitary sewer, and shall provide a grease-interceptor(s) inlet-flow control-
device inspection port and a grease-interceptor effluent monitoring port:
         A.   Every commercial food-preparation and/or food-service facility,
including but not limited to bakeries, butcher shops, cafes, clubhouses,
commercial kitchens, delicatessens, ice-cream parlors, hospitals, restaurants,
schools, and similar facilities, especially where meat, poultry, seafood, dairy
products or fried foods are prepared or served.
         B.   All facilities engaged in any type of food preparation and/or
service operation including, but not limited to, the preparation, packaging,
cooking, sales or treatment of food products, and whose sewage is not in excess
of the parameters defined for “food sewage.” For purposes of this section,
“food service sewage” is sewage generated by a food service customer and having
characteristic intensity not higher than 500 mp/1 BOD-5, 230 mp/l suspended
solids, and 1 to 5 peak load factor.
         C.   All facilities the use of which generates sewage resulting from
other than normal household activities having a characteristic intensity in
excess of 210 mp/l, BOD-5, 200 mp/l suspended solids, 1 to 3 peaking factor.
         D.   All shopping centers that have food-processing facilities.
         E.   All food courts.
         F.   All other facilities discharging grease in amounts that, in the
opinion of the Village, Woodbran or the Cuyahoga County Board of Health will,
alone or in combination with other substances from the discharges of the same
or other facilities, have a reasonable chance to inhibit the flow in any
sanitary sewer.
      (2)   All new areas of intensified use or dwelling, including, but not
limited to adult day-care facilities, assisted-living facilities, convalescent
homes, day nursing and childcare facilities, in which food preparation occurs,
home for the mentally challenged, hotels, maternity homes, motels in which
there is a commercial food-preparation service, nursing homes, retirement and
life- care communities and homes, and truck stops with commercial food service,
shall be required to have grease interceptors. Modifications to existing
facilities that do not add new buildings, add new grease-generating activities,
or increase grease-generating activities are exempt from this requirement.
      (3)   Interceptors shall not be required for single-family residences,
duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, or apartment complexes, unless the Village
and/or Woodbran first determines there are discharges from the property that
may create problems in the sanitary sewer system. The determination shall be
made based upon an investigation of such property and a comparison of the
content and amount of discharge from the property with the discharges of other
properties similar in size and use. Upon a determination hereunder that the
discharges may create problems in the sanitary sewer system, the Village shall
require the installation of a sufficiently sized grease interceptor to treat
the discharges.
   (d)   Compliance and Timeline.  
      (1)   On or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this
section, the owner of an existing facility (excepting those existing facilities
described in this section) shall be required to install an approved, adequately
sized, and properly operated and maintained grease interceptor when any of the
following conditions exist:
         A.   It is found by the Village, Woodbran or Cuyahoga County Board of
Health to be contributing grease in potential quantities sufficient to inhibit
sanitary sewer flow or necessitate increased maintenance on the sanitary sewer
collection system in order to keep impairments to the main line flow from
occurring.
         B.   It is remodeling the food preparation or kitchen waste plumbing
facilities in such a manner to be subject to a permit issued by the Village
Building Department.
         C.   Its interceptor allows a discharge of oil or grease in excess of
250 mg/l.
         D.   It is required by this section or other applicable ordinance to
maintain a grease interceptor and is found to be equipped with an undersized
grease interceptor. Such a facility shall, within ninety (90) days of the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, install an adequately
sized grease interceptor in accordance with the specifications of this section.
         E.   It is required by this section or other applicable ordinances to
maintain a grease interceptor and is found not to be equipped with a grease
interceptor. Such a facility shall, within sixty (60) days to the effective
date of the ordinance codified in this section, install an adequately sized
grease interceptor in accordance with the specifications of this section.
      (2)   Owners of new facilities required by this section or other
applicable ordinances to maintain a grease interceptor shall install such a
unit prior to commencement of discharge to the sanitary sewer system.
      (3)   Any requests for extensions to installation dates must be made in
writing to the Village and Woodbran, at least thirty (30) days in advance of
the compliance date. The written request shall include the reasons for the
Facility’s failure or inability to comply with the compliance date set forth,
the additional time needed to complete the remaining work, and the steps to be
taken to avoid future delays. Upon receipt of such a request, the Village shall
determine the date for compliance following consultation with Woodbran
regarding the same.
      (4)   Owners of existing Facilities required by this section or other
applicable ordinances to maintain a grease interceptor that demonstrate that
the installation of a grease trap is not feasible may use bioremediation as an
alternative. The Village and the Cuyahoga County Board of Health will determine
whether a Facility may exercise this option for sanitary sewer maintenance. The
bioremediation method and product must be approved by the Village, Woodbran,
and Cuyahoga County Board of Health in writing prior to use in the sanitary
sewer system. In addition, the operator of each such existing Facility must
maintain written documentation of a current contract with a bioremediation
supplier approved through the Village and/or Cuyahoga County Board of Health,
copies of which shall be provided by such operator to the Village and Woodbran.
      (5)   All owners and operators of Facilities shall be required to send to
Woodbran and the Cuyahoga County Board of Health, on a semi-annual basis,
certified test results from an independent testing laboratory, providing
Woodbran with the chemical characteristics of its sewage discharge. The results
shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
         A.   BOD-5;
         B.   Suspended solids;
         C.   Peaking factors;
         D.   Pounds of phosphorus;
         E.   Characteristics of any other special wastes allowed by the
Company to be discharged into its system by any Facility; or other such
specific data as Woodbran deems relevant to the particular operation and
service location of the Facility.
   If an owner or operator of a Facility fails to provide Woodbran with such
data, Woodbran and the Cuyahoga County Board of Health shall make the tests and
such owner or operator shall be charged for Woodbran’s costs of performing such
tests plus twenty percent (20%) of such costs and any other related expenses
including any attorney fees and costs of collection. If the owner or operator
of a Facility refuses to conduct such tests or refuses to allow Woodbran to
conduct such tests, Woodbran shall have the right to disconnect sanitary sewer
service to such owner or operator.
   (e)   Discharge Criteria.  
      (1)   Where oil and grease are a byproduct of food preparation and/or
cleanup, reasonable efforts shall be made to separate waste oil and grease into
a separate container for property disposal. Except as contained in byproducts
of food preparation and/or cleanup, waste oil and grease shall not be
discharged to any drains or grease interceptors. Such waste shall be placed in
a container designed to hold such waste and either utilized by industry or
disposed of at suitable locations.
      (2)   None of the following agents shall be placed directly into a grease
interceptor, or into any drain that leads to the interceptor:
         A.   Emulsifiers, de-emulsifiers, surface active agents, enzymes,

Fahrenheit (150oF). The temperature at the flow-control device inspection port
shall be considered equivalent to the temperature of the influent.
      (4)   Toilets, urinals, and other similar fixtures shall not discharge
through a grease interceptor.
      (5)   Waste shall only enter the grease interceptor through the inlet-
flow-control device.
      (6)   Where food-waste grinders are installed, the waste from such units
shall discharge directly into the building drainage system without passing
through a grease interceptor. Living quarters, as defined in subsection (c)(2)
hereof are exempted from this requirement.
   (f)   Requirements for Grease Interceptors.
      (1)   The owner or operator of a new or existing Facility must apply for
all necessary permits prior to installation of any grease trap or interceptor,
and shall provide copies of all such permits to Woodbran and the Cuyahoga
County Board of Health.
      (2)   The plumbing inspector assigned by the State of Ohio will oversee
the installation of the trap or interceptor.
      (3)   Grease traps shall be installed a minimum distance of ten feet
(10') from sinks and dishwashers to allow for adequate cooling of wastewater.
Water temperatures must be less than 150oF prior to entering grease trap.
      (4)   Sample port. A sample port shall be installed on the effluent line
of each grease trap. The port shall be a minimum of six inches (6") in diameter
and be connected to the sewer line at a 90o degree angle to allow for sampling
activities. The port shall be installed in such a manner as to be protected
from storm sewer contamination and maintained in a safe and proper operating
condition. The plug on the sample port must be easily removable.
   (g)   Interceptor Maintenance.

or grit interceptor waste to be removed from his premises by a transporter who
does not have all applicable Federal, State, or local permits or registrations,
including any permit required by the Cuyahoga County Board of Health.
      (2)   If a vacuum truck company is used to remove the grease from the
interceptor or trap, the following information must be kept on file with the
operator and submitted to the Village and Cuyahoga County Board of Health:
         A.   The vacuum truck company name, address, and telephone number,
         B.   The name of a primary and secondary contact person at the vacuum
truck company,
         C.   The Cuyahoga County Board of Health permit number,
         D.   Be signed and dated by an authorized representative of the vacuum
truck company indicating acceptance of the terms of the contract, and
         E.   The name, address, and telephone number of the disposal site.
         F.   The signature of the Facility representative present when the
grease trap was cleaned.
      (3)   The vacuum truck company shall provide a Certificate of Insurance,

interceptor is appropriately cleaned and inspected.
   (h)   Required Pumping Frequency.
      (1)   Unless otherwise specified in writing by the Village, Woodbran and
the Cuyahoga County Board of Health, each grease interceptor in active use
shall be cleaned at least once every calendar quarter and more frequently as
needed to prevent carryover of grease into the sanitary sewer system. The
Village, Woodbran or the Cuyahoga County Board of Health may specify cleaning
more frequently when quarterly pumping is determined by the Village, Woodbran
or the Cuyahoga County Board of Health to be inadequate. Any grease generator
desiring a schedule less frequent than quarterly shall submit a written request
to the Village, Woodbran and Cuyahoga County Board of Health, demonstrating to
the Village, Woodbran and the Cuyahoga County Board of Health that the pumping
frequency can be performed at greater intervals without impairment of the
operation of the public sewer.

required under this chapter.
      (4)   The Village may suspend water or sewer service and Woodbran may
suspend sewer service when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the
Village or Woodbran, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which:
         A.   Presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons or the environment;
         B.   Causes or may cause stoppages or excessive maintenance to be
required to prevent stoppages in the sanitary sewer collection system; and/or
         C.   Causes interference to the sanitary sewer system.
      (5)   Any person notified of a suspension of the water or sewer service
shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a failure of
the person to comply voluntarily with a suspension order, the Village and/or
Woodbran may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
termination of water or sewer service, to prevent or minimize actual or
threatened damage to the sanitary sewer system or sewer connection or
endangerment to any individuals. The Village shall reinstate the water or sewer
service and Woodbran shall reinstate sanitary sewer service upon receipt of
proof that such conditions causing the suspension have passed or been
eliminated. A detailed written statement submitted by the Facility describing
the cause(s) of the harmful discharge and the measure(s) taken to prevent any
future occurrence shall be submitted to the Village and Woodbran within fifteen
(15) days of the date of occurrence.
      (6)   Any person who violates any provisions of this section, or who

1155.01 PURPOSE.
   The Community Office Business Overlay sometimes hereinafter referred to as
“COBO” is established to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (a)   To provide, in appropriate locations, areas for office development,
both local and regional.
   (b)   To provide areas of sufficient size and locations for a combination of
office use and accessory commercial and retail use.
   (c)   To encourage the assemblage of parcels to provide reasonable
development and safe access to public streets.
   (d)   To encourage creative design and flexible mixed use of larger parcels
of land along business corridors.
      (Ord. 2008-13. Passed 4-16-08.)
1155.02 DEFINITION.
   (a)   Mixed-use development planned for Community Office Business Overlay
should include planned integration of some combination of retail office and
residential uses. It may offer hotel, recreation or other functions. It is
pedestrian oriented and contains elements of a live-work-play environment. It
maximizes space usage, has amenities and architectural expression and tends to
mitigate traffic and sprawl.
   (b)   It is recognized that a Community Office Business Overlay use may be
proposed as a conditional use in areas zoned U-2 Apartment House District, U-
3 General Business District and U-4 General Office Building District. The uses
which may conditionally be permitted in the Community Office Business District
are to be limited in their scope, prohibiting those which generate high volumes
of traffic at peak times. Where other requirements are not prescribed by this
Chapter or by conditions of a Community Office Business Overlay use approved by
the Council, the underlying zoning district uses, requirements, standards and
regulations shall remain in full force and effect.
      (Ord. 2008-13. Passed 4-16-08.)
1155.03 USE REGULATIONS.

1155.04, shall be permitted by right as the principal building or use of a
zoning lot.
   (b)   Conditional uses are certain types of main or accessory uses so
classified because of their uncommon characteristics, infrequency of
occurrence, large land requirements or special features or conditions and shall
not be permitted by right. Such conditional uses and buildings as identified in
the schedule, Section
1155.04, shall require consideration and approval by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and Council according to the special lot conditions.
   (c)   The accessory buildings and uses set forth in the schedule, Section
1155.04, shall be permitted as subordinate buildings or uses if they are
planned and developed integrally therewith, clearly incident thereto, and
located on the same zoning lot as the main building or use and conform to the
requirements of Section
1155.05.
   (d)   A building designed and constructed as a residence cannot be occupied
in whole or in part by a use permitted in this district. Existing residences

but may be continued and maintained as a residence subject to all the lot area,
building area and yard regulations of the Community Office Business Overlay.
   (e)   All buildings and uses proposed as part of a development plan shall be
constructed, occupied and maintained as per the approved development plan in
accordance with Chapter
1155 of this Zoning Code.
   (f)   In order to construct, lease, rent, sell, occupy or maintain buildings
and uses utilizing the special lot conditions, the zoning lot shall be
assembled and maintained in one parcel of common ownership.
   (g)   Conditional and accessory uses permitted in accordance with the
special lot conditions of Section

1159.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a) Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate Sexually Oriented
Businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare
of the citizens of the Village of Woodmere, and to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location of Sexually Oriented
Businesses within the Village of Woodmere. The provisions of this chapter do
not have the purpose or effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Further, it is not the intent of this chapter to restrict or deny access by
adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to
deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of
this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
   (b) Findings. The Village Council has received substantial evidence
concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community in
findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres,
Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976),
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and on studies in other

1166.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish general guidelines for the
siting of wireless communications towers and antennas. The goals of this
chapter are to: (1) protect residential areas and land uses from potential
adverse impacts of towers and antennas; (2) encourage the location of towers in
non-residential areas; (3) minimize the total number of towers throughout the
community; (4) strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites
as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers;
(5) encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent
possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; (6)
encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that
minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through careful
design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques;
(7) enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to
provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently;
(8) consider the public health and safety of communications towers; and (9)
avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through
engineering and careful siting of tower structures. In furtherance of these
goals, the Village of Woodmere shall give due consideration to the Village of
Woodmere's master plan, zoning map, existing land uses, and environmentally
sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of towers and antennas.
(Ord. 1997-17. Passed 4-16-97.)

and antennas governed by this chapter shall bring such towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of
the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different
compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency.
Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised
standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower
and antenna at the owner's expense.
   (g)    Building Codes; Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity
of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local building codes
and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic
Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the
Village of Woodmere concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and
standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice
being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty days to
bring such tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such
tower into compliance within said thirty days shall constitute grounds for the
removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense.

      (2)   Factors considered in granting Conditional Zoning Certificates for
towers. In addition to any standards for consideration of nonconforming use
permit applications pursuant to Chapter
1173  of the Village of Woodmere Planning and Zoning Code, the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether
to issue a conditional zoning certificate, although the Planning Commission may
waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if
the Planning and Zoning Commission concludes that the goals of this chapter are
better served thereby:
         A.   Height of the proposed tower;
         B.   Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries; it being understood that towers and ancillary structures
are not to be located within twelve feet of any residential district or within
any setback area defined in Chapter 1165 from a residential district, whichever
distance is greater.
         C.   Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
         D.   Surrounding topography;
         E.   Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
         F.   Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
         G.   Proposed ingress and egress; and
         H.   Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures, as
discussed in Section
1166.07(b)(3) of this chapter.
      (3)    Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technology. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant
demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Planning and Zoning
Commission that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology that
does not require the use of towers or structures can accommodate the
applicant's proposed antenna. An applicant shall submit information requested
by the Planning and Zoning Commission related to the availability of suitable
existing towers, other structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted
to demonstrate that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology can
accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the
following:
         A.   No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area which meet applicant's engineering requirements.
         B.   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet applicant's engineering requirements.
         C.   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
         D.   The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant's proposed antenna.
         E.   The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner
in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower
or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower
development are presumed to be unreasonable.
         F.   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
         G.   The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that
does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell
network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a
wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new
tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology
unsuitable.
      (4)    Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all
towers for which a conditional zoning certificate is required; provided,
however, that the Planning and Zoning Commission may reduce the standard
setback requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served
thereby:
         A.   Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least seventy-five
percent (75%) of the height of the tower from any adjoining lot line.
         B.   Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning
district setback requirements.
      (5)    Separation. The following separation requirements shall apply to
all towers and antennas for which a conditional zoning certificate is required;
provided, however, that the Planning and Zoning Commission may reduce the
standard separation requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better
served thereby.
         A.    Separation from off-site uses/designated areas.
            1.   Tower separation shall be measured from the base of the tower
to the lot line of the off-site uses and/or designated areas as specified in
Table 1, except as otherwise provided in Table 1.

less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate
anti-climbing device; provided, however, that the Planning and Zoning
Commission may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate.
      (7)    Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the
landscaping surrounding towers for which a conditional zoning certificate is
required provided, however, that the Planning and Zoning Commission may waive
such requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby.
         A.   Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant
materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from property
used for residences. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at
least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound.
         B.   In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be
minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived.
         C.   Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as
towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property
perimeter may be sufficient buffer.

or a conditional zoning certificate and without having to meet the separation
requirements specified in Section
1166.07(b)(4) and
1166.07(b)(5). The type, height, and location of the tower onsite shall be of
the same type and intensity as the original facility approval. Building permits

destroyed. If no permit is obtained or if said permit expires, the tower or
antenna shall be deemed abandoned as specified in Section

Other Building or Uses 
(q)    For a specific building or use not scheduled above, the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall apply the unit of measurement of the schedule above
deemed to be the most similar to the proposed building or use.
(r)    In addition to the above off-street parking schedules, one additional
parking space shall be required for each pinball game, electronic game, or
other mechanical device at each place of business.
(Ord. 82-08. Passed 3-17-82.)
Office Buildings
(s)    First floor usage used for retail purposes shall meet the requirements
of subsections (m) through (r) hereof, herein. Usage above the first floor,
when devoted to standard office space usage, shall require one space per two-
hundred fifty square feet of total floor space so used, including storage and
file areas. Usage on or above the first floor, when devoted to any other usage,
shall conform to the requirements of this chapter.
   (1973 Code Section 151.26.)
1169.05 MODIFICATIONS FOR EXISTING BUILDING OR USE.
   For an existing building or use which does not conform to parking
requirements as set forth in Section
1169.04, and where land is not available on the same lot or adjoining lot, the
Planning and Zoning Commission may modify the locations of parking facilities
to permit such facilities within 400 feet walking distance of the building or
use.
(1973 Code Section 151.26.)
1169.06 SHARING OF FACILITIES.
   A building containing one use shall provide the off-street parking spaces as
required for the specific use. A building, or group of buildings, containing
two or more uses, operating normally during the same hours, and which have
different off-street parking requirements, shall provide spaces for not less
than the sum of the spaces required for each use, or the spaces required for a
large unit development of a business building. Institutions and places of
worship may assume that up to, but not more than, fifty percent (50%) of their
requirements may be shared in adjacent parking areas, which are necessary to
business establishments, and which normally have different hours of operation.
However, where there is a sharing of facilities by different owners, there
shall be a contract covering a period of time which may be required by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, and, should any of the uses be changed or the
facilities discontinued, then the required spaces for the use remaining shall
be provided elsewhere as a condition precedent to the continued use of the
building or buildings .
(1973 Code Section 151.26.)
1169.07 LOCATION; DRIVEWAY AND TRUCK PARKING.
   Accessory parking facilities shall be located on the same lot of the

in a garage, provided the truck is used solely by the occupant of the dwelling.
(1973 Code Section 151.26.)
1169.08 DRIVEWAYS.
   (a)   The location and width of entrance and exit driveways to parking
facilities shall be planned to interfere as little as possible with the use of
nearby property, and with pedestrian and vehicular traffic on the nearest
streets. The center line of the access driveways on the frontage street shall
be at least forty feet from the right-of-way line of the nearest intersecting
street, and spaced at not less than one-hundred twenty feet intervals measured
from the center line of the driveways. At least two separate driveways shall be
provided, and whenever possible, they shall be limited to either entrance or
exit.
   (b)    Entrances and exits shall be limited to three lanes. The width of the
entrances and exits, measured at the setback line, shall conform to the
following schedule:
 
Lanes Width - (feet)
      Minimum Maximum
One   12      14
Two   24      28
Three 30      40
   (c)    In all cases, the radius of the edge of the apron shall be at least
twenty feet so that a car entering from the curb lane shall be perpendicular to
the setback line at the driveway without obstructing vehicles in other traffic
lanes.
(1973 Code Section 151.26.)
   (d)    Should the Planning and Zoning Commission find that it is necessary
to further limit driveway access to Chagrin Boulevard, it may specifically vary
the provisions of this section, subject to the approval of Council.

in gross floor area, and each required loading space for a building of 15,000
square feet or more of floor area shall be not less than twelve feet wide by
fifty feet in length. In all cases, off-street loading spaces shall be provided
for a building or a group of buildings so that the length of the required space
shall be in accordance with the usual size of the truck employed for loading or
unloading. Each space shall have a vertical clearance of at least fourteen
feet. The above areas shall be exclusive of aisle and maneuvering space.
   (b)    Schedule of requirements for off-street loading spaces.

be occupied by vehicles making deliveries. Each loading space shall be designed
for direct access to a street or drive in- a manner which will least interfere
with other traffic movements
   (d)    All parking and loading areas and drives shall be provided with three
inch minimum asphalt or adequate concrete as specified. All parking and loading
areas and drives shall provide adequate drainage so that all water is drained
within the lot on which the parking area or drive is located in such manner
that water shall not drain across other private property.
(1973 Code Section 151.26.)
1169.10 MAINTENANCE OF PARKING FACILITIES.
   Whoever, including individuals or persons, firms or corporations, owns,
occupies, uses, rents, leases, or controls any off-street parking facilities
described in this chapter shall maintain the facilities in a safe and clean
manner, and in good repair, and keep them free from refuse, debris, weeds,
parking facility materials, building materials, and any foreign materials
which, if permitted to remain, would drift or be deposited upon any street or
highway or public walk, or portion thereof, or any natural ditch or any sewer
or catch basin, or would create a nuisance or a condition dangerous to public
health and safety, or which, if permitted to remain, would naturally spread to
adjoining or surrounding properties.

Zoning Ordinance for the district in which the land or building is located,
subject to the following conditions and specifications.
   (a)    Any nonconforming use of land or building which has ceased by
discontinuance or abandonment for a period of ninety days shall thereafter
conform to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and every ordinance passed
subsequent to May 28, 1956.

      (4)    A soils engineering report. The Village Engineer may require the
SWP3 to include a Soils Engineering Report based upon his/her determination
that the conditions of the soils are unknown or unclear to the extent that
additional information is required to protect against erosion or other hazards.
This report shall be based on adequate and necessary test borings, and shall
contain all the information listed below. Recommendations included in the
report and approved by the Village Engineer shall be incorporated in the
grading plans and/or other specifications for site development.
         A.    Data regarding the nature, distribution, strength, and
erodibility of existing soils.
         B.    If applicable, data regarding the nature, distribution,
strength, and erodibility of the soil to be placed on the site.
         C.    Conclusions and recommendations for grading procedures.
         D.    Conclusions and recommended designs for interim soil
stabilization devices and measures, and for permanent soil stabilization after
construction is completed.

         F.    Opinions and recommendations covering the stability of the site.
            (Ord. 2016-100. Passed 12-14-16.)
1181.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the owner must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization).
   The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-sediment
pollution controls contained therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction. The approved plan must be implemented until the
site reaches final stabilization. All properties adjacent to the site of soil
disturbing activity shall be protected from soil erosion and sediment run-off
and damage, including, but not limited to, private properties, natural and
artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public lands.
   It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of contractor
(s) responsible for implementation the SWPJ and providing that information to
the Village Engineer. The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact storm water runoff. The S WP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3.
   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and maintained
effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the course of earth
disturbing activities.
   The controls shall include the following minimum components:
   (a)    NON-STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION MEASURES: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree preservation areas
or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil compaction shall be
minimized and, unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and
maintain a 50-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the state, or riparian setbacks, if applicable, whichever is greater,
unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible, e.g. stream crossings for roads
or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation and restoration.
Direct stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment removal and maximize
Stormwater infiltration. If the riparian setback is greater than 50 feet, no
disturbance of natural vegetation shall occur within the riparian setback
unless a variance of the riparian setback regulation has been granted.
   (b)   EROSION CONTROL PRACTICES: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. The amount of soil
exposed during construction activity shall be minimized. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
Table 1: Permanent Stabilization

Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed.
 
      (2)    Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Owners shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Ohio Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide
available at www. nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   RUNOFF CONTROL PRACTICES. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent
erosion. Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to
minimize erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge
locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive
flow velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical
and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
   (d)    SEDIMENT CONTROL PRACTICES. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas to minimize sediment discharges from
the site. Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days. Such practices
may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain
inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to
a sediment settling pond. All sediment control practices must be capable of
ponding runoff in order to be considered functional. Earth diversion dikes or
channels alone are not considered a sediment control practice unless used in
conjunction with a sediment settling pond. The design, installation and
maintenance of erosion and sediment controls shall address factors such as the
amount, frequency, intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of
resulting stormwater runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of
soil particle sizes expected to be present on the site. Sediment control
practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
SCM upon approval from the Village Engineer is required for any one of the
following conditions, as determined in Table 3 below:
         A.    Concentrated stormwater runoff.
         B.    Runoff from drainage areas that exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence (see Table 3), inlet protection, or other sediment barriers.
         C.    Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of
disturbed land.
         D.   Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the fonn of a
sediment trap or sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Rainwater
and Land Development. The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a
sediment trap shall be limited to less than 5 acres. Contributing drainage
areas of 5 acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin. An equivalent
stormwater control measure best management practice may be utilized upon
approval from the Village.
         E.   The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage
zone and a dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least
1,800 cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. The
dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a minimum of
48-hour drain time, and, unless infeasible, be designed to always withdraw
runoff from the surface of the pond throughout the stonn cycle. As such, a
skimmer discharge device consistent with Ohio Rainwater and Land Development
shall be provided to dewater sediment basins. Sediment traps shall also provide
both a sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet structure
shall be constructed consistent with the specifications contained in the latest
edition of Ohio Rainwater and Land Development.
         F.    When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be
used as temporary sediment trapping SCMs, a skimmer discharge device consistent
with Ohio Rainwater and Land Development shall be utilized during construction
phase and until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the Village of
Woodmere.
         G.    The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of
sediment basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the
pond provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering
zone. As such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be
no discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage
zone and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only
occur through the skimmer.
         H.   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by
one of the following methods:
            Method 1:    The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be
1000ft3 per disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
            Method 2:    The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the
volume necessary to store the sediment as calculated with Revised Universal
Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) or other a generally accepted erosion prediction
model as per the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development.
         I.    When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site
areas and areas which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be
included unless runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment
settling pond and is not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of
the dewatering zone must be less than or equal to five (5) feet. The
configuration between the inlets and the outlet of the sediment settling pond
must provide at least two units of length for each one unit of width > 2: 1
length-to-width ratio; however a length to width ratio of > 4: 1 is
recommended. Sediment must be removed from the sediment settling pond when the
design capacity of the sediment storage zone has been completely filled by
sediment accumulations. This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies
one-half of the basin depth. When designing sediment settling ponds, the owner
must consider public safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design
factor for the sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used
where site limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a combination
of sediment and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant
removal is encouraged.
      (3)    Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties
and water resources from sediment transported via sheet flow. Where intended to
provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on a level contour and
shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The relationship between the
maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is shown in
Table 3 below. Placing silt fence in parallel does not extend the permissible
drainage area to the silt fence.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence Based on Slope
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of Slope for drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                > 20% but <50%
 
   Alternative perimeter controls for sheet tlow discharges may be considered
by the Village of Woodmere, but their usc shall not exceed the limitations
indicated in Table 3 above. Detail drawings and plan notes shall specify the
diameter of filter socks, compost berms and other such alternative perimeter
controls if used instead of silt fence.
   Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away from
disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices, which include swales, dikes or
berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to 10 acres.
      (4)    Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. The maximum contributing drainage area
shall not exceed one (1) acre. Straw or hay bales around catch basins are not
acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (5)    Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Stormwater control
measures must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These stormwater control measures must include, but
are not limited to, the following:
         A.    Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the
only permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These
entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled
concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent
edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.    Streets directly adjacent to construction entrances and
receiving traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned daily to remove
sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on these streets
nearest to the construction entrances shall also be cleaned weekly. Streets and
catch basins adjacent to construction entrances shall be kept free of sediment
tracked off site.
   Based on site conditions, Village Engineer may require additional stormwater
control measures to control off site tracking and dust. These additional SCMs
may include:
         C.    Silt fence or construction fence shall be installed around the
perimeter of the development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to
designated construction entrances.
         D.    Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas. Wash water from
these areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, a sediment-settling
pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
 1181.09(g) of this regulation. No surfactants or detergents may be used to
wash vehicles.
         E.    Owners shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The Village Engineer may require dust
controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed areas, trapping
stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation of the
speed of vehicles on the site.
      (6)   Surface Waters of the State Protection. Construction vehicles shall
avoid water resources. A 50 foot undisturbed natural buffer shall be provided
around surface waters of the state unless infeasible. If it is infeasible to
provide and maintain an undisturbed 50-foot natural buffer, the SWP3 shall
comply with the stabilization requirements in
1181.09(b)(1) for areas within 50 feet of a surface water or riparian setbacks
if applicable, minimize soil compaction and, unless infeasible, preserve
topsoil. If the owner is permitted to disturb areas within 50 feet of a water
resource, the following conditions shall be addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All SCMs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of Ohio Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Structural SCMs shall be designated and implemented on site to
protect water resources from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in water resources
or wetlands.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
         G.   Concentrated storm water runoff from SCMs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands. The flow should
be released such that no erosion occurs down slope. Level spreaders may need to
be placed in series to ensure nonerosive velocities.
         H.   Protected areas or critical areas, including wetlands and
riparian areas shall be physically marked in the field prior to earth
disturbing activities.
      (7)   Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the owner
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
         A.   NON-SEDIMENT POLLUTANT CONTROLS: No solid or liquid waste,
including building materials, shall be discharged in stormwater runoff. The
owner must implement site stormwater control measures to prevent toxic
materials, hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources,
wetlands or the MS4. These practices shall include but are not limited to the
following:
      (8)   Waste Materials: A covered dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (9)   Wastewater: Contaminated washout from stucco, paint, form release
oils, curing compounds, and other construction materials shall not be
discharged directly into a water resource or storm sewer.
      (10)   Vehicle fluids: No pollutants from vehicle fuel, oils, or other
vehicle fluids can be discharged to surface waters of the State.
      (11)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, other public facility, natural resource or water of the
state is prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available.
      (12)   Disposal of Other Wastewaters: The discharge of washout and
cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other
construction materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural
resource or waters of the state is prohibited. The discharge of soaps or
solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited. If
generated, these wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
      (13)   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 1100% of the volume of the
largest containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall be provided to
clean up spills. The ESC Plan shall contain spill prevention and response
procedures and these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-construction
meeting.
      (14)   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly. The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
      (15)   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Discovery of previously
unknown contaminated soils onsite shall be self-reported to Ohio EPA and local
authorities. Contaminated soils from redevelopment sites shall be disposed of
properly. Runoff from contaminated soils shall not be discharged from the site.
Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid waste
landfill sites or redevelopment sites. Where construction activities are to
occur on sites with contamination from previous activities, operators shall be
aware that concentrations of materials that meet other criteria (i.e. not
considered a Hazardous Waste, meeting Voluntary Action Program (VAP standards))
may still result in storm water discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality
Standards. Such discharges are not authorized by this code. Control measures
which may be utilized to meet this requirement include, but are not limited to:
         A.   Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated runoff
and prevent discharge.
         B.   Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer with
the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
         C.   Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or other
such methods to prevent stormwater from coming into contact with contaminated
materials.
   The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure of building
materials, building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Owners may also
reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, Safety Response Plans,
etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such
plan is maintained on site.
      (16)   Compliance with other requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent
with applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic
system regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open
burning, and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils
located within the development area.
      (17)   Trench and ground water control. There shall be no sediment laden
or turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
      (18)   Internal Inspections. All controls on the site shall be inspected
at least once every seven (7) calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm
event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection
frequency may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is
temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g.,
site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of
inspection requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions
are expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been
attained from the Village Engineer and all of the following conditions are met:
         A.   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
         B.   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
         C.   For sites that will not be completed by October 1, a Pre-Winter
Stabilization Meeting shall be held by the landowner and the developer.
engineer and contractor of the project and the Village of Woodmere prior to
October 1, in order to plan and approve winter erosion and sediment controls as
defined in the most current online edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
   The owner shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the SCMs are functional and to evaluate whether the
SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are required.
Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and experience in
the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion controls. Certified
inspection reports shall be submitted to the Village Engineer within seven (7)
working days from the inspection and retained at the development site. These
inspections shall meet the following requirements:
         a.   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
         b.   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3
shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The owner shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the Village or an alternate form
acceptable to the Village Engineer. The inspection form shall include:
            1.   The inspection date.
            2.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
            3.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
            4.   Weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of inspection.
               Locations of:
            5.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
            6.   SCMs that need to be maintained.
            7.   SCMs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate
for a particular location.
            8.   Where additional SCMs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
            9.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to
the SWP3 and implementation dates.
            10.   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
            11.   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be
inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
            12.   The owner shall maintain for three (3) years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non-compliance determined by these inspections.
      (19)   Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All SCMs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. All
sediment SCMs must be maintained in a functional condition until all up slope
areas they control reach final stabilization. The owner shall provide a
description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the continued
performance of SCMs and shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding
to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
   When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control SCMs, the following procedures shall be followed:
         A.   When SCMs require repair or maintenance. If an internal
inspection reveals that a SCM is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         B.   When SCMs fail to provide their intended function. If an internal
inspection reveals that a SCM fails to perform its intended function as
detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be
installed within three (3) to ten (10) days of the inspection as determined by
the Village Engineer or his/her designated inspector.
         C.   When SCMs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an internal
inspection reveals that a SCM has not been implemented in accordance with the
schedule, the SCM must be implemented within ten (10) days from the date of the
inspection. If the internal inspection reveals that the planned control
practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as
to why the control practice is not needed.
      (20)   Final stabilization: Final stabilization shall be determined by
the Village Engineer. Once a definable area has achieved final stabilization,
the owner may note this on the SWP3 and no further inspection requirement
applies to that portion of the site. Final stabilization also requires the
installation of permanent (post-construction) SCMs. Obligations under this
ordinance shall not be completed until installation of post-construction SCMs
are verified.
      (21)   Disposition of Temporary Practices. All temporary and permanent
erosion and sediment control practices shall be disposed of within thirty (30)
days after final site stabilization is achieved or after the temporary
practices are no longer needed, unless otherwise authorized by the Village
Engineer. Trapped sediment shall be permanently stabilized or removed to
prevent further erosion.

boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems, including rear yard inlets. Straw or hay
bales around an inlet arc not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (6)   Silt Fence and Other Perimeter Controls. Silt fence and other
perimeter controls approved by the Village of Woodmere shall be used to protect
adjacent properties and water resources from sediment discharged via sheet
(diffused) flow. Silt fence shall be placed along level contours and the
permissible drainage area is limited to those indicated in Table 3 of these
regulations.
      (7)   Internal Inspection and Maintenance. All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24
hour period.
         Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.    When SCMs require repair or maintenance. If the internal
inspection reveals that a SCM is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         B.    When SCMs fail to provide their intended function. If the
internal inspection reveals that a SCM fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be installed
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         C.    When SCMs depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not installed. If
the internal inspection reveals that a SCM has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the inspection reveals that
the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement
of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.

1183.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the Village of Woodmere:
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the Village of Woodmere to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
stormwater control measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and ground water are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the Village of Woodmere’s
future expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
1183.01.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County, and the
Village of Woodmere shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects
initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable, for
projects initiated before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the Village Engineer. Such projects must be designed to minimize
the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of Chapter
1181 Erosion and Sediment Control.
   (g)   This regulation does not apply to construction or re-construction of
stand-alone single family dwellings when the parcel is not part of an overall
subdivision or is part of a subdivision that is in existence as of the adoption
of this ordinance, unless otherwise required by the Village Engineer. (Ord.

real property or connect or cause to be connected any building or other
structure, either directly or indirectly, with a drain for the removal of
surface, roof, ground or other water to be discharged into a ditch, swale,
waterway, stream or an existing storm drainage system for such real property,
without complying with the performance standards and paying the charges set
forth in this chapter.
   (b)   General: The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources.
The SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological, and chemical integrity
of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site.
Acceptable SCMs shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project and comply with Chapter
1187 Riparian Setbacks.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         E.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Ohio Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by the Village of Woodmere and Ohio EPA.
SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional criteria
required by the Village Engineer, shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)   SCMs designed for final use: SCMs shall be designed to achieve the
stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be compatible with the
proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in the Zoning Code, shall provide stormwater management
and water quality controls for the development of all subdivided lots. This
shall include provisions for lot grading and drainage that prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm; and maintain, to the extent
practicable, the pre-development runoff patterns, volumes, and peak flows from
each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources: SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the owner shows
proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the U.S.
Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as required

activities, shall not be constructed in any special flood hazard area.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels: All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the owner shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
1183.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the stormwater
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing SCM or if the
stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by SCMs defined in
a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the Village
Engineer.

 1183.08.
      (8)   Agreements with Sub-dividers or Developers. A sub-divider or
developer shall be required to construct an on-site SCM for the purposes of
water quality and water retention approved by the Village Engineer. The
combination of stormwater quality and quantity requirements for two or more
developments may be placed into one detention basin to be located at a
strategic site given that a separate agreement with all parties is developed.
The Village shall enter into an agreement with the sub-divider or developer, to
be approved by Council, containing the following conditions:
         A.   The sub-divider of a major subdivision shall require the
formation of a homeowners' association, which shall assume responsibility for
all maintenance, upkeep, repair, replacement and management of the SCM. In
other developments, the sub-divider or developer shall make provisions
acceptable to the Village for maintenance of the SCM area as stated in Section
1183.10. Easements shall be granted to the Village for access to and
maintenance of the stormwater management area.
         B.   If more than one development is to use a single SCM, a separate
association of all members using that SCM shall be formed. This association
will be held responsible for all future maintenance and repairs of the SCM as
stated in this Chapter.
         C.   The sub-divider or developer shall be exempt from the application
of this Section only if authorized by the Village Engineer.
         D.   Where a sub-divider or developer is exempt from the provisions of
this Section, that sub-divider or developer shall comply with and pay fees in
accordance with this Chapter, governing subdivisions and development prior to
the effective date of this Section.
         E.   All SCMs will be placed within blocks and/or easements to allow
Village access (See Section
1183.11).
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage. SCMs that preserve and/
or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum extent
practicable. Such SCMs may include minimizing site grading and compaction;
protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and existing
vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction operations in
order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time, and designation
of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and grubbing practices;
and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and through these areas.
Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide perpetual management of
runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving stream’s physical, chemical and
biological characteristics are protected and ecological functions are
maintained.
      (10)   Preservation of Wetland Hydrology: Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs BMPs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters a wetland(s) in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope. SCMs Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology.
If the owner applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a
hydrological analysis shall be preformed to demonstrate that the proposed
discharge matches the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics
      (11)   Soil Preservation and Post-Construction Soil Restoration: To the
maximum extent practicable leave native soil undisturbed and protect from
compaction during construction. Except for areas that will be covered by
impervious surface or have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil moisture-
holding capacity of areas that have been cleared and graded must be restored to
that of the original, undisturbed soil to the maximum extent practicable. Areas
that have been compacted or had the topsoil or duff layer removed should be
amended using the following steps: 1. till subsoil to a depth of 15-18 inches,
2. incorporate compost through top 12 inches, 3. Replace with stockpiled site
or imported suitable topsoil to a minimum depth of 4 inches.
   (c)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)    Stream/storm sewer discharge. The stormwater facility (storm sewer
main or natural watercourse) that will convey the discharge from the site shall
be analyzed to determine if it is capable of conveying the additional storm
sewer discharge from the site of a 100-year/24-hour storm. If the designated
outlet is not capable of conveying the discharge from the site during the 100-
year/24-hour storm, then additional storage must be placed onsite to store the
additional volume for a period of 48 hours.
      (2)    Surface water protection: The Village Engineer may allow
modification to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only
if the owner shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the
Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local
agencies as required in Section
1183.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1181 Erosion and Sediment Control and Chapter
1187 Riparian Setbacks all as determined by the Village Engineer. At a minimum,
stream relocation designs must show how the project will minimize changes to
the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat of upstream
and downstream channels on and off the property.
      (3)    Off-site stormwater discharges: Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the owner’s development site shall be conveyed through
the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at its
existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that off-
site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a
manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (4)    Sheet flow. The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. Flow shall be
directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or other SCM from areas too long
and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as determined by the Village
Engineer.
      (5)    Open channels: Unless otherwise allowed by the Village Engineer,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with landscaped
banks and designed to carry the 10-year, 24-hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas.
      (6)    Drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on all
new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm Sewer systems
shall be allowed to augment open drainage systems, such as to limit depth of
roadside or conveyance ditches. The following criteria shall be used to design
storm sewer systems when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewer design flow shall be based on the Rational Method.
Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge from runoff
caused by the 10 - year, 24 - hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade line of
the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying roadway, or
below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway, whichever is more
restrictive during a 25 - year, 24 - hour storm. The system shall be designed
to meet these requirements when conveying the flows from the contributing area
within the proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are
upstream from the development. These calculations will be reviewed and approved
by the Village Engineer prior to design acceptance. Rainfall data shall be
obtained from the latest volume of the NOAA Rainfall ATLAS 14 or per Table 1.
Runoff coefficients shall be per Table 2.
Table I - Rainfall per Storm Frequency

         B.   Rainfall intensity will be calculated using the equation i = a/
(t+b)^c)
Where:
i = Rainfall intensity (in./hour)
t = Time of concentration (minutes)
Refer to Ohio Department of Transportation’s Location & Design Manual, Volume 2
(or latest edition) Drainage Design, Figure 1101-2 for Rainfall Intensity
Constants (a, b & c).The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces
no less than 2.5-fps and no more than a 10-fps velocity within the pipe barrel
under design flow conditions.
         C.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches.
         D.   All stormwater conveyance systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
            i.    Previous studies on file with the Village.
            ii.    FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
            iii.    Calculations prepared by a Registered Professional
Engineer.
         E.   Catch basin design spread calculations shall be submitted to the
Village Engineer for review to determine catch basin spacing and sizing. At a
minimum, there shall be at least one total clear lane during a 25 year, 24 hour
storm.
         F.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Outlets discharging into an open-water conveyance structure shall
have an invert at a minimum of three inches above the average water depth
during the snow-melt season.
         I.   The flood elevation for a 100 year, 24 hour storm must be a
minimum of ten feet away horizontally from the perimeter of any homes within
the new subdivision, nor cause any home flooding to adjacent neighboring
properties, and shall be at least two feet below the finished grade elevation
of any livable structure.
         J.   All storm sewer outlets from a subdivision must flow either into
a public storm sewer, stream of the State, or a major ditch unless authorized
by the Village Engineer.
         K.   The maximum distance for sheet flow shall be 300 feet before
entering a storm structure. Except, that the maximum overland drainage area
tributary to the storm structure shall be no greater than 1.5 acres.
      (7)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the Village:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 100-year, 24-hour storm or as
indicated by the Village Engineer. The maximum allowed headwater for such a
storm shall be 12 inches below pavement crown elevation. Water crossings
carrying receiving waters located near upstream Village borders shall convey no
more flow than currently designed to carry unless directed by the Village
Engineer.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or
conveyance must be sized to carry the 100-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10-
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be one foot below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the
100-year, 24-hour storm, or the 100-year flood elevation as determined by FEMA,
whichever is more restrictive.
      (8)   Overland flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (9)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the Village must be
compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First consideration for
the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be given to areas
where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new floodplain
within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also be given to
enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for floodplain
fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing watershed. Unless
otherwise permitted by the Village, reductions in volume due to floodplain
fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the development.
Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must reasonably conform to
the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The use of vertical
retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (10)   Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (d)   Stormwater Quality Control:
      (1)   Direct runoff to a SCM: The site shall be designed to direct runoff
to one or more of the following SCMs. These SCMs are listed in Table 4 of this
regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general performance
standards:
         A.   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         B.   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote settling,
filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured stormwater
into the ground. The Village Engineer may require a soil engineering report to
be prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed infiltration
facilities meet these performance standards.
         C.   For sites disturbing less than five (5) acres, but greater than
one (1) acre and not part of a common plan of development or sale, where 5 or
more acres are disturbed, the Village Engineer may approve other SCMs if the
owner demonstrates to the Village Engineer’s satisfaction that these SCMs meet
the objectives of this regulation.
         D.   For sites disturbing five (5) or more acres, or less than five
(5) acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, the Village Engineer may approve other SCMs if
the owner demonstrates to the Village Engineer’s satisfaction that these SCMs
meet the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
 1183.09(c)(6), and has prior written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         E.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the Village Engineer may approve SCMs not included in Table 2 of
this regulation, but must show compliance with the current version of the Ohio
Departments of Transportations “Location and Design Manual, Volume Two Drainage
Design”.
         F.   The Village Engineer may approve other SCMs if the owner
demonstrates to the Village Engineer’s satisfaction that these SCMs meet the
objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
1183.09(c)(6).
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs. SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the Village
Engineer that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed SCMs controlling the
amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-term hourly
records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
                  WQV =    C*P*A/12
                  where terms have the following meanings:
                  WQV =    water quality volume in acre-feet
                  C =       runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than
1 in.
                  P =       0.75 inch precipitation depth
                  A =       area draining into the SCM, in acres.
Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA) for use in determining the water quality volume can be determined using
the list in Table 3 or using the following equation to calculate the runoff
coefficient:
C=0.858i3 – 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:
i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
Table 3: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (> 8 dwellings/acre)      0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the stormwater treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is
High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
         B.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the SCM for sediment storage. This volume shall be
incorporated into the sections of SCMs where pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   Each individual SCM must be sized to treat the WQv associated
with its entire contributing drainage area. Exceptions to this may be granted
by the Village Engineer and/or the OEPA on a case-by-case basis.
         D.   SCMs for quality shall be designed such that the drain time is
long stormwater enough to provide treatment and protect against downstream bank
erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for successive rainfall
events as defined in Table 4.
         E.   Sites within watersheds of coldwater habitat streams shall
include SCMs to infiltrate the water quality volume or reduce the temperature
of discharged runoff. SCMs that reduce the temperature of discharged runoff
include bioretention, permeable pavement, underground detention, and
incorporation of shading and infiltration in parking lot design.
         F.   All wet or dry extended stormwater detention facilities shall
have a forebay and micropool as per the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development.

Sand and other Media Filtration 5             24 hours
1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours
to provide storage for subsequent storm events.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended detention
basins. Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv.
3 Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQV .
4 Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within 24 hours so that
there is no standing water. Shorter drawdown times are acceptable as long as
design criteria in Ohio Rainwater and Land Development have been met.
6 This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale.
7 Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv
in a pool and 75% in marshes. The EDv above the permanent pool must be equal
to the WQv.
 
         G.   Each SCM shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection Plan and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
         H.   The seasonal high groundwater elevation is the normal water line
or normal elevation of saturation.
         I.   Water quality volume (WQv) orifices less than 3-inches in
diameter shall be designed with an anti-clogging or non-clogging design.
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.   Infiltration facilities shall only be allowed if the soils of the
facility have an infiltration rate between 0.5 in./hr. and 4.0 in./hr. (or
deemed acceptable by the Village Engineer)), if the seasonal high water table
is at least three (3) feet below the final grade elevation, and any underlying
bedrock is at least six feet below the final grade elevation. Infiltration
trenches should be designed to meet all criteria in the current edition of the
Ohio Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site. No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria applying to extended conveyance facilities.
         A.   Facilities designed according to the extended conveyance
detention design drain time shall:
            1.   Not be located in areas where the depth to bedrock and/or
seasonal high water table is less than 3 feet below the final grade elevation.
            2.   Only be allowed where the underlying soil consists of
hydrologic soil group (HSG) A or B, unless the underlying soil is replaced by
at least a 2.5 foot deep layer of soil amendment with a permeability equivalent
to a HSG A or B soil and an underdrain system is provided.
         B.   Concentrated runoff shall be converted to sheet flow, or a
diffuse flow using a plunge pool, flow diffuser or level spreader, before
entering an extended conveyance facility.
      (5)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than 1/3rd of the drain time. If
elevations allow, a valve shall be provided to drain any permanent pool volume
for removal of accumulated sediments. The outlet shall be designed to minimize
clogging, vandalism, maintenance and promote the capture of floatable
pollutants.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ratio of 3:1 or flatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4 feet
shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8 feet and no
more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The 8 feet wide portion
of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an average depth of 6
inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation.
The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below the
permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who accidentally or
intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense vegetation in a
manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through the vegetation.
The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). The aquatic
bench shall be planted with hardy native species of plant comparable to wetland
vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged inundation. The use of invasive
plant species is prohibited.
            3.   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets. The forebay and micropool volume shall
be equal to at least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
            4.   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary outlet
becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to facilitate maintenance.
The emergency drain should be designed to drain by gravity where possible.
      (6)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction SCMs:
The owner may request approval from the Village Engineer for the use of
alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the applicant shows to the
satisfaction of the Village Engineer that these SCMs are equivalent in
pollutant removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those
listed in Table 4. If the site is greater than five (5) acres, or less than
five (5) acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which
will disturb five (5) or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA and the
Village as necessary. To demonstrate the equivalency, the applicant must show:
         A.   The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State. The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the owner can demonstrate one
of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a (TMDL) has identified water quality problems in the
receiving surface water of the State.
   (e)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Developers or sub-dividers shall include in their preliminary plans
a local watershed study to determine the impact from the development or
subdivision caused by stormwater onto the lands adjoining or downstream from
the area to be developed, to assure that said lands shall not be adversely
affected by the proposed development or subdivision.
      (3)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (4)    The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method that or
other hydrologic method approved by the Village Engineer, the total volume
(acre-feet) of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development
drainage area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the
following standards:
            1.    Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.    Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.    Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            4.    Rainfall data shall be obtained from the latest volume of the
NOAA Rainfall ATLAS 14 or per Table 1.
            5.    Temporal Distribution Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events. Include lot coverage assumptions used for
full build out of the proposed condition.
            6.    Curve numbers for the pre-development condition must reflect
the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land use. Curve Numbers shall conform to the National Engineering Handbook
Table 9-1.
               a.   Post-development Curve Numbers - All areas that are altered
by construction practices shall use post-construction Hydraulic Soil Groups
from Ohio Rainwater and Land Development.
            7.    Time of Concentration - Use velocity based methods from (TR-
55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
            8.    The volume reduction provided by permeable pavement,
bioretention, or other LID SCMs may be subtracted from the post development
stormwater volume. Volume reductions for these practices may be demonstrated
using methods outlined in Ohio Rainwater and Land Development or a hydrologic
model acceptable to the Village Engineer.
            9.    To account for future post-construction improvements to the
site, calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or
concrete for all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface
proposed in the site description except in instances of engineered permeable
pavement systems.
         B.   From the volume determined in Section 1337.09(d)(3)A., determine
the percent increase in volume of runoff due to development. Using the
percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table 5.
Table 5: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff is: The Critical Storm
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:              will be:

---                       10                          1 year
10                        20                          2 year
20                        50                          5 year
50                        100                         10 year
100                       250                         25 year
250                       500                         50 year
500                       ---                         100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
         C,   For sites with less than one acre of disturbed land and not part
of a common plan of development:
            1.   If the post-developed flow for the critical storm is less than
110% of the pre-developed critical storm flow, no stormwater quantity measures
need to be implemented.
            2.   If the post-developed flow for the critical storm is equal to
or greater than 110% of the pre-developed critical storm, stormwater quantity
measures need to be implemented so that the post-developed critical storm flow
is less than the pre-developed critical storm flow.
   (f)   Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects: Comprehensive
Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment projects shall reduce existing
site impervious areas by at least 20 percent. A one-for-one credit towards the
20 percent net reduction of impervious area can be obtained through the use of
pervious pavement and/or green roofs.
      (1)   Where site conditions prevent the reduction of impervious area,
SCMs shall be implemented to treat at least 20 percent of the WQv.
      (2)   When a combination of impervious area reduction and stormwater
quality control facilities are used, ensure a 20 percent net reduction of the
site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20 percent of the WQv,
or a combination of the two.
      (3)   Where projects are a combination of new development and
redevelopment, the total water quality volume that must be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at
100 percent water quality volume and redevelopment at 20 percent.
      (4)   Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section
1183.10 may be approved by the Village Engineer. (Ord. 2017- 11. Passed 10-11-
17.)
1183.10 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the Village determines that site constraints compromise the
intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in an
improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
      (2)   Implemented in the same Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 112 watershed
unit as the proposed development project.
      (3)   The mitigation ratio of the water quality volume is 1.5 to 1 or the
water quality volume at the point of retrofit, whichever is greater.
      (4)   An inspection and maintenance agreement as described in Chapter
1183.08(d)(10) is established to ensure operations and treatment in perpetuity.
      (5)   Obtain prior written approval from Ohio EPA.
   (b)   Alternative actions may include, but are not limited to the following.
All alternative actions shall be approved by the Village Engineer:
      (1)   Fees, in an amount specified by the Village to be applied to
community-wide SCMs.
      (2)   Implementation of off-site SCMs and/or the retrofit of an existing
SCM to increase quality and quantity control.
      (3)   Stream, floodplain, or wetland restoration.
      (4)   Acquisition or conservation easements on protected open space
significantly contributing to stormwater control such as wetland complexes.
(Ord. 2017-11. Passed 10-11-17.)
1183.11  EASEMENTS.
   Access to SCMs as required by the Village Engineer for inspections and

   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the Village Engineer, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less than 25-feet wide.
The easement shall also incorporate the entire SCM plus an additional 25-foot
wide band around the perimeter of the SCM.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
   (e)   Easements to structural SCMs shall be restricted against the
construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and other structures that may
obstruct the free flow of stormwater and the passage of inspectors and
maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final grade from that
described by the final grading plan approved by the Village. Any re-grading
and/or obstruction placed within a maintenance easement may be removed by the
Village at the property owners’ expense. Grading and/or obstructions that is/
are revised or removed may not be returned to original condition or
configurations if determined by the Village of Woodmere to be an obstruction to
the operation and maintenance of the stormwater facility. (Ord. 2017-11. Passed
10-11-17.)
1183.12 MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed by the owner and provided to the
Village Engineer:
   (a)   Final stabilization must be achieved and all permanent SCMs must be
installed and made functional, as determined by the Village Engineer and per
the approved Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
   (b)   An As-Built Certification, including As-Built Survey and Inspection,
must be sealed, signed and dated by a Professional Engineer and a Professional
Surveyor with a statement certifying that the SCMs, as designed and installed,
meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan approved

1183.13 ON-GOING INSPECTIONS.
   The owner shall inspect SCMs regularly as described in the Inspection and
Maintenance Plan and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement. The Village has the
authority to enter upon the property to conduct inspections as necessary, with
prior notification of the property owner, to verify that the SCMs are being
maintained and operated in accordance with this regulation. Upon finding a
malfunction or other need for maintenance, the Village shall provide written
notification to the responsible party, as detailed in the Inspection and
Maintenance Agreement, of the need for maintenance. Upon notification, the
responsible party shall have ten (10) working days, or other mutually agreed
upon time, to make repairs or submit a plan with detailed action items and
established timelines. Should repairs not be made within this time, or a plan
approved by the Village Engineer for these repairs not be in place, the Village
may undertake the necessary repairs and assess all costs to the responsible
party.
(Ord. 2017-11. Passed 10-11-17.)
1183.14 FEES.
   The Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan review, filing, and inspection
fee is part of a complete submittal and is required to be submitted to the
Village before the review process begins. The Village Building Department shall
establish a fee schedule based upon the actual estimated cost for providing
these services.
(Ord. 2017-11. Passed 10-11-17.)
1183.15 BOND.
   (a)   If a Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan is required by this
regulation, soil-disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond
of 5% of the total project cost, has been deposited with the Village Finance
Department. This bond shall be posted for the Village to perform the
obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner of the development area as
stated in this regulation and to allow all work to be performed as needed in
the event that the owner fails to comply with the provisions of this
regulation. The stormwater bond will be returned, less Village administrative
fees as detailed in Chapter
1183 of the Village Codified Ordinances, when the following three criteria are
met:
      (1)   After 80% of the lots of the project have been complete or 100% of
the total project has been permanently stabilized or three (3) years from the
time of permanent stabilization have passed.
      (2)   An As Built Inspection of all SCMs is completed by the owner and
approved by the Village Engineer.
      (3)   An Inspection and Maintenance Plan has been approved by the Village
of Woodmere and an Inspection and Maintenance Agreement signed by the
developer, the contractor, the Village, and the private owner or homeowners
association who will take long term responsibility for these SCMs, is accepted
by the Village Engineer.
   (b)   Once these criteria are met, the owner shall be reimbursed all bond
monies that were not used for any part of the project. If all of these criteria
are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site, the
Village may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding issues with all
stormwater management structures on the site and the remainder of the bond
shall be given to the private lot owner/ homeowners association for the purpose
of long term maintenance of the project. (Ord. 2017-11. Passed 10-11-17.)
1183.16 INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY SCMs.
   The owner may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the Village Engineer. This occurs after the completion of the
final grade at the site, after all of the utilities are installed, and the site
is subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods. The
developer must provide documentation acceptable to the Village Engineer to
demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized. Upon this proof of
compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed and placed into
service. Upon completion of installation of these SCMs, all disturbed areas
and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these SCMs must be
stabilized within 2 days. (Ord. 2017-11. Passed 10-11-17.)
1183.17 VIOLATIONS.
   No person shall violate or cause or knowingly permit to be violated any of
the provisions of this regulation, or fail to comply with any of such
provisions or with any lawful requirements of any public authority made
pursuant to this regulation, or knowingly use or cause or permit the use of any
lands in violation of this regulation or in violation of any permit granted

(Ord. 2008-23. Passed 5-21-08.)
1185.07 DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION PROHIBITIONS
   (a)   Prohibition of Illicit Discharges. No person shall discharge, or cause
to be discharged, an illicit discharge into MS4. The commencement, conduct, or
continuance of any illicit discharge to the MS4 is prohibited except as
described below:
      (1)   Water line flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows;
rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration; uncontaminated
pumped ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains;
air conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; and discharges or flows from fire fighting activities. These
discharges are exempt until such time as they are determined by the Village of
Woodmere to be significant contributors of pollutants to the MS4.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the Village of Woodmere as being
necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Discharges from off-lot discharging home sewage treatment systems
permitted by the Cuyahoga County Board of Health for the purpose of discharging
treated sewage effluent in accordance with Ohio Administrative Code 3701-29-02
(6) until such time as the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency issues an NPDES
permitting mechanism for residential 1, 2, or 3 family dwellings. These
discharges are exempt unless such discharges are deemed to be creating a public
health nuisance by the Cuyahoga County Board of Health.
   In compliance with the Village of Woodmere Storm Water Management Program,
discharges from all off-lot discharging home sewage treatment systems must
either be eliminated or have coverage under an appropriate NPDES permit issued
and approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. When such permit
coverage is available, discharges from off-lot discharging home sewage
treatment systems will not longer be exempt from the requirements of this
regulation.
   (b)   Prohibition of Illegal Connections. The construction, use,
maintenance, or continued existence of illegal connections to the MS4 is
prohibited.
      (1)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illegal
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (2)   A person is considered to be in violation of this regulation if the
person connects a line conveying illicit discharges to the MS4, or allows such
a connection to continue. (Ord. 2008-23. Passed 5-21-08.)
1185.08 MONITORING OF ILLICIT DISCHARGES AND ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   Establishment of an Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection
Monitoring Program:  The Village of Woodmere shall establish a program to
detect and eliminate illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4.
This program shall include the mapping of the MS4, including MS4 outfalls; the
routine inspection of storm water outfalls to the MS4, and the systematic

   (a)   It is hereby determined that the system of rivers, streams, and other
natural watercourses within the Village of Woodmere contributes to the health,
safety, and general welfare of the residents of the Village of Woodmere. The
specific purpose and intent of this regulation is to regulate uses and
developments within riparian setbacks that would impair the ability of riparian
areas to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of flood waters, and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Assist in stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce bank
erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourse
banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling, and
transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses.
      (5)   Provide watercourse habitats with shade and food.
      (6)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain a
diverse aquatic system.
      (7)   Provide habitat to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse
and connected riparian vegetation.
      (8)   Benefit the Village of Woodmere economically by minimizing
encroachment on watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering
solutions such as gabion baskets and rip rap to protect structures and reduce
property damage and threats to the safety of watershed residents; and by
contributing to the scenic beauty and environment of the Village of Woodmere,
and thereby preserving the character of the Village of Woodmere, the quality of
life of the residents of the Village of Woodmere, and corresponding property
values.
   (b)   The following regulation has been enacted to protect these services of

1187.09 VARIANCES WITHIN RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend to the Village
Council a grant of a variance to this regulation as provided herein. In
granting a variance, the following conditions shall apply:
      (1)   In determining whether there is unnecessary hardship with respect
to the use of a property or practical difficulty with respect to maintaining
the riparian setback as established in this regulation, such as to justify the
granting of a variance, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the
potential harm or reduction in riparian functions that may be caused by a
proposed structure or use.
      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may not authorize any structure
or use in a Zoning District other than those authorized in the Zoning Code.
      (3)   Variances shall be void if not implemented within one (1) year of
the date of issuance.
   (b)   In making a determination under Section
1187.09(a) of this regulation, the Planning and Zoning Commission may consider
the following:
      (1)   The natural vegetation of the property as well as the percentage of
the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain.
      (2)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, erosion control, water quality protection, or other functions of the
riparian setback. This determination shall be based on sufficient technical and
scientific data.
      (3)   The degree of hardship, with respect to the use of a property or
the degree of practical difficulty with respect to maintaining the riparian
setback as established in this regulation, placed on the landowner by this
regulation and the availability of alternatives to the proposed structure or
use.
      (4)   Soil-disturbing activities permitted in the riparian setback
through variances should be implemented to minimize clearing to the extent
possible and to include Best Management Practices necessary to minimize erosion
and control sediment.
      (5)   The presence of significant impervious cover, or smooth vegetation
such as maintained lawns, in the riparian setback compromises its benefits to
the Village of Woodmere. Variances should not be granted for asphalt or
concrete paving in the riparian setback. Variances may be granted for gravel
driveways when necessary.
      (6)   Whether a property, otherwise buildable under the ordinances of the
Village of Woodmere, will be made unbuildable because of this regulation.
   (c)   In order to maintain the riparian setback to the maximum extent
practicable, the Planning and Zoning Commission may consider granting
variations to other area or setback requirements imposed on a property by the
Zoning Code.
   (d)   In granting a variance under this regulation, the Planning and Zoning
Commission, for good cause, may impose such conditions that it deems
appropriate to maintain the purposes of this regulation.

1301.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective July 1, 2009, and as identified
and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.
      (OBC 101.3)

hazard, or to vacate or raze the building, the building official shall proceed
under Ohio R.C. 3781.15.
   (c)   Restoration. Where the structure or equipment is determined to be
unsafe by the Building Official, it is permitted to be restored to a safe

rules of the Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order,
standard or rule of the Divisions of State Fire Marshal or Industrial
Compliance in the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Health and of
counties and townships, in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are
in conflict with the rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that

   (c)   Plan Examination by the Building Official. When the Building
Department does not have in its full-time employ a certified master plans

certification by the registered design professional indicating conformance with
the requirements of the rules of the Board and Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and

the rules of the Board of Building Standards. Such information shall be
retained in the official permanent record for each project. One set of approved
construction documents shall be retained by the Building Official for a period
of not less than one hundred eighty days from date of completion of the
permitted work, or as required by document retention regulations.
   (g)   Liability. Liability of certified Building Department personnel for
any tortious act will be determined by Ohio courts to the applicable provisions
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 2744.
1301.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter or any Code adopted herein or
fails to comply with any lawful order issued pursuant thereto is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned not more than six months or both. Each day
during which noncompliance or a violation continues shall constitute a separate

1309.01 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY REQUIRED.
   (a)    Any house or other commercial or residential structure now being or
hereafter constructed within the limits of the Municipality shall not be
occupied or used until a Certificate of Occupancy is obtained from the Building
Inspector.
   (b)    The Building Inspector shall not issue a Certificate of Occupancy to
the owner of any house, or commercial or residential structure, until the
following requirements have been met:
      (1)    A continuous means of egress has been provided, paved with
concrete, asphalt, gravel or other similar substance, from the house or
structure to the public street or sidewalk in front of the sub-lot;
      (2)    Proper provision has been made for the drainage and disposal of
sanitary and storm sewage and other liquid wastes in accordance with the
regulations of the Municipality and the statutes of the State;
      (3)    All of the requirements of the Building Code and Zoning Ordinance
have been met;
      (4)    A heating unit to be used in heating the entire house and a unit
for heating hot water have been installed and are in operable condition;
      (5)    If natural gas is to be used to meet any of the requirements of
this section, then such gas must be available inside the structure;
      (6)    If electricity is to be used to meet any of the requirements of
this section, then such electricity must be available inside the structure;
      (7)    A device in accordance with the requirements of the Municipality,
as such requirements now exist or are hereafter enacted, must be installed to
dispose of garbage or other burnable trash;
      (8)    All excess building materials, soil, or other debris must be
removed from the property surrounding the structure, and all trenches or
excavations filled.
         (1973 Code § 150.02)
1309.02 CONDITIONAL OCCUPANCY PERMITS.
   (a)    The Building Inspector may issue a conditional occupancy permit for
the house or structure, if the weather conditions then existing prevent
completion of one or more of the requirements outlined in Section
1309.01. However, the corporation, partnership, association or persons
constructing the house or structure shall agree in writing that the work not
completed will be completed by a date determined by the Building Inspector as
set forth in the agreement and in the conditional occupancy permit. If the work
is not completed by the date set forth, then the conditional occupancy permit
shall be considered to have been revoked as of the date on which it was issued,
and the corporation, partnership, association or persons constructing the house
or structure shall be considered to be in violation of this section from the
first day on which the house or structure was occupied.
   (b)    For the Building Inspector to issue a conditional occupancy permit,
he must first determine that the existing weather conditions prevent completion
of the work required in Section
1309.01, and that occupancy of the house or structure will not in any fashion
be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, nor will it create
problems relative to sanitary or storm sewage, nor will the lives or health of
any persons occupying the house or structure be placed in jeopardy by
occupancy.
(1973 Code §150.03)
1309.03 DECISION OF THE BUILDING INSPECTOR FINAL.
   The decision of the Building Inspector shall be final. However, any person
who feels that the Inspector has wrongfully refused to issue a permit or
conditional permit may appeal the decision to the Planning and Zoning
Commission by informing the Clerk of Council in writing of his desire to bring
the matter before the Planning and Zoning Commission, and setting forth the
reasons that he believes entitle him to the permit or conditional permit. The
Clerk shall thereupon bring the appeal before the Commission for hearing not
later than the next meeting. The Commission may, by a majority vote of the
elected members, overrule the Building Inspector and order the Certificate of
Occupancy issued.
(1973 Code § 150.04)
1309.04 WAIVER.
   (a)    The requirement of a permit may be avoided by the contractor if he
shall secure the signature of the purchaser of such property upon a waiver form
to be supplied by the Building Inspector. However, if the purchaser of the
property executes such a waiver, he thereupon shall become subject to the
provisions and requirements of this section as set forth in this chapter, and
before occupying, permitting to occupy or reselling the house or structure,
must secure the certificate of occupancy.
   (b)    If the owner has executed a waiver, he may secure a conditional
occupancy permit by agreeing that the work necessary to complete the
requirements of Section
1309.01 will be completed by a date set forth in both the agreement and in the
conditional occupancy permit. The conditional occupancy permit shall be issued
by the Building Inspector only after the findings required for the issuance of
the permit in Section
1309.02 have been made. If the owner shall fail to complete the work necessary
by the date set forth, the conditional occupancy permit shall be considered
revoked as of the date of its issuance, and each day of occupancy shall be
considered to be a separate violation of this section.
(1973 Code §150.06)
1309.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the first degree. Each day on which a violation occurs or continues shall be
deemed a separate offense.

prospective purchaser or grantee prior to the time of transfer of title to the

Inspector shall procure a search warrant as provided by law to gain entry.

the correction of any Code violations noted on the Certificate, which shall be
corrected by the owner of the property within ninety days of the issuance of
the Certificate unless, for good cause shown, the Building Inspector has
extended that time for compliance. If the owner of a property does not comply
by correcting the violation enumerated in the Certificate of Inspection prior
to the time the title is transferred to the purchaser, then the purchaser of
that property will be required to comply by correcting the violations contained

to correct all violations listed on the Certificate of Inspection, the seller
shall deposit in escrow before transfer of title to the purchaser either a
compliance document described in Section

filed with the escrow agent setting forth an agreed sum of money that is
sufficient to cover the costs of correcting those specific violations listed on
the Certificate of Inspection which remain uncorrected.
 
   (d)   If, under the terms of the contract of sale, the purchaser's
obligation for correction of violations listed on the Certificate of Inspection
is limited to contribution of a specifically stated dollar amount, or is
limited to purchaser's obligation to correct specific, but not all, Code
violations, then the seller shall deposit in escrow either a compliance
document described in Section
1311.03(a), if, in fact, all such violations have been corrected, or a
compliance document described in Section
1311.03(b), together with a written statement agreed upon by the seller and
purchaser filed with the escrow agent setting forth an agreed sum of money that
is sufficient to cover the costs of correcting the violations listed on the
Certificate of Inspection which remain uncorrected and for which the seller is

agreed to correct all violations as provided in subsection (c) above, or the
purchaser's obligation is not limited to payment of a stated sum of money or to
correction of specific violations as provided in subsection (d) immediately
above, then the contract of sale between the seller and the purchaser shall be
conditional upon the seller and purchaser agreeing in writing after the
Certificate of Inspection has been exhibited to the purchaser, as to their
respective obligations for correction of the remaining uncorrected violations
listed on such Certificate. The seller and purchaser shall thereafter deposit

of correcting those violations remaining uncorrected for which the seller is
responsible.
 
   (f)   Sections
1311.01  through
1311.07  of this chapter set forth requirements and procedures applicable to
relationships between the seller and purchaser at the time of sale of real
estate, as to Code violations. Nothing contained in such sections shall be
construed as limiting the Village, at any time, from proceeding against the
owner of property to require correction of Code violations.
 
   (g)   This chapter shall not apply to the individual transfer of property
through inheritance or gift where no bona fide sale is intended or completed.
(Ord. 1991-07. Passed 4-17-91.)

file for record an instrument to transfer title thereto or disburse any funds
from such sale unless the provisions of this chapter have been satisfied
including, but not limited to, the specific provisions of Section
1311.05.
 
   (b)   Any funds deposited in escrow for the cost of correcting Code

insure, warrant or guarantee to the holder thereof, to his assignees, or any

Inspection.
 
   (b)   In issuing a compliance document under the provisions of this chapter,
the Village does not thereby insure, warrant or guarantee the quality of repair

Certificate of Inspection. Such document should be construed only as a
statement by the Village that some or all of the violations listed on the

(Ord. 1991-07. Passed 4-17-91.)

certificate of occupancy, incorporating the change, has been issued. Any change
without the approval of the proper Village authorities will subject the owner,

comprehensive but balanced system of sign graphics and thereby to facilitate
communication between people and their environment. With this purpose in mind,
it is the intention of this chapter to authorize the use of sign graphics which
are:
   (a)   To promote attractive and maintain high value in business districts
and attractive public facilities and education districts;
   (b)   To provide for reasonable and yet appropriate, conditions for
advertising goods sold or services rendered in business districts by regulating
the size, type and design of signs to the type and size of establishment
providing that no ground sign shall be used for the advertising of goods or
services.
   (c)   To provide for appropriate signs for the identification and
encouragement for further growth and development of business in the Village;
   (d)   To promote the most desirable developments and economic activities in
accordance with the objectives of the master plan of the Municipality.

signs without reference to the message conveyed by any sign and without
attempted regulation of any sign on the basis of the message conveyed by the
sign.
   (f)   To permit signs compatible with their surroundings, appropriate to the
type of activity to which they pertain and legible in the circumstances in
which they are seen.
   (g)   To regulate the physical characteristics of signs on aesthetic, public
safety and general welfare basis.
   The provisions of this chapter do not apply to signs placed or erected in
the residential districts of the Village and shall apply only to signs

other cause to the extent that the cost of restoration will exceed sixty
percent (60%) of the original cost of such sign, shall not be restored unless
it is made to conform to all the regulations of this chapter, or any subsequent
amendment thereto. In the event that such damage or destruction is less than
sixty percent (60%) of the original cost of such sign, no repairs or
construction shall be made unless such restoration is started within six months

no later than October 30, 2001.
