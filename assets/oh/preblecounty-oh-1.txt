ARTICLE II: INTENT AND PURPOSE
Section
   
201   Purpose
§ 201 PURPOSE.
   A.   The zoning resolution of this county is adopted with the purpose of
promoting and protecting the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and
general welfare of the people. The fulfillment of this purpose is to be
accomplished by seeking:
      1.   To encourage and facilitate orderly, efficient, and appropriate
growth and development;
      2.   To protect agricultural, residential, business, commercial, and
industrial areas alike from harmful encroachment by incompatible uses and to
ensure that land allocated to a class of uses shall not be usurped by other
inappropriate uses;
      3.   To avoid the inappropriate development of lands and provide for
adequate drainage, curbing, or erosion, and reduction of flood damage;
      4.   To foster a more rational pattern of relationship between
agricultural, residential, business, commercial, and manufacturing uses for the
mutual benefit of all;
      5.   To protect those areas which are not and/or cannot be served by
central sewer systems from growth intensities which could be hazardous to the
public health;
      6.   To establish population densities to prevent or reduce congestion
and to secure economy in the cost of providing water supply and sewage
facilities, streets and highways, fire and police protection, schools, parks
and recreation facilities, and other governmental services; and
      7.   To zone all properties with a view to conserving the value of
buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the
county.
   B.   The standards and requirements contained in this code and the district
mapping reflected on the County Zoning Map are intended to further the
implementation of the objectives and policies of this county as well as protect
all desirable existing structures and uses.

shall be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for the promotion of the
public health, safety, comfort, morals, convenience, and general welfare.
   B.   It is not intended by this code to interfere with, abrogate, or annul
any easements, covenants, or other agreements between parties, nor is it

resolutions, other than expressly repealed hereby, or any rules, regulations,
or permits previously adopted or issued, and not in conflict with any of the
provisions of this code, or which shall be adopted or provided, pursuant to
law, relating to the use of buildings or land; provided, however, that where
this code imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or land than
are required or imposed by such easements, covenants, or agreements between
parties, or by such laws, rules, regulations, or permits, the provisions of
this code shall govern. In no case, however, shall this code prohibit the use

be inapplicable to any person or situation, the effect of such decision shall
be limited to the provision or provisions which are expressly stated in the

effect in the controversy. All other provisions of this code shall continue to
be separate and fully effective, and the application of that provision to other
persons or situations shall not be affected.

the Zoning Inspector stating that the proposed use of the building or land
conforms to the requirements of this code.

§ 801 A – AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT.
§ 801.01 PURPOSE.
   A.   This district is established for either of the following purposes:
      1.   To protect land best suited for agricultural use from the
encroachment of incompatible land uses and to preserve valuable agricultural
land for agricultural uses; and
      2.   To protect the open area from the encroachment of scattered urban
type uses permanently or until such time as the area is ready for more
intensive development and can be provided with urban services.
   B.   Lands within the Agricultural District are used for commercial
agricultural production. Owners, residents, and other users of this property
may be subjected to inconvenience, discomfort, and the possibility of injury to
property and health or even death arising from normal and accepted agricultural
practices and operations, including but not limited to noise, odors, dust, the
operation of machinery of any kind, including aircraft, the storage and
disposal of manure, the application of fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides.
   C.   Owners, residents, and users of this property should be prepared to
accept these conditions and are hereby put on official notice that “right to
farm” provisions within the Ohio Revised Code may bar them from obtaining a
legal judgment against such normal agricultural operations.

§ 811 I-1 – LIMITED INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.
§ 811.01 PURPOSE.
   A.   The Limited Industrial District is provided in recognition of
industrial uses which seek locations in suburban areas and in relative close
proximity to residential areas of the county. These industrial uses generally
require a minimum of services and facilities and generate little industrial
traffic. They typically operate within an enclosed structure and have little or
no adverse effect on adjacent land by producing noise, odor, dust, smoke,
glare, or hazard.
   B.   In addition to these uses, the I-1 District makes provision for certain
storage, service, manufacturing, and processing facilities which may generate
significant amounts of truck traffic and/or involve activities which are not
viewed as compatible with adjacent uses as those listed as permitted uses with
the district. Such uses are listed under conditional uses which require
individual review to ensure their locational compatibility within the county.
Generally, such uses would be best located adjacent to major thoroughfares
within the county and some distance from residential areas.

§ 813.01 PURPOSE.
   The overall purpose of the planned development zoning provisions is to
permit greater flexibility in physical development requirements, and thereby
encourage more creative and imaginative development design than is possible
under conventional zoning provisions. Approval of such proposals will be
granted, however, only upon favorable review of submitted plans for tracts
suitable in location and character for the uses and structures proposed, and
are to be planned and developed in a unified manner. Such proposals will be
further evaluated, and approved only upon determination that the public health,
safety, and morals will not be jeopardized by a departure from the restrictions
on corresponding uses in the standard zoning district.

   The County Planning Commission shall not recommend for approval and the
County Rural Zoning Commission shall not approve a request for a planned
development unless it shall, in each individual case, make specific findings of
facts directly based upon the particular evidence presented to it, which
supports conclusions that:
   A.   The planned development can be substantially completed within the
period of time specified in the schedule of development submitted by the
developer;
   B.   The site will be accessible from public roads that are adequate to
carry the traffic that will be imposed upon them by the proposed development,
and the street and driveways on the site of the proposed development will be
adequate to serve the residents or occupants of the proposed development;
   C.   The development will not impose an undue burden on public services and
facilities, such as utilities, fire, and police protection;
   D.   The development plan contains such proposed covenants, easements, and
other provisions relating to the proposed development standards, as would
reasonably be required for the public health, safety, and welfare;
   E.   The location and arrangement of structures, parking areas, walks,
lighting, and appurtenant facilities shall be compatible with the surrounding
land uses, and any part of a planned development not used for structures,
parking and loading areas, or accessways, shall be landscaped or otherwise
improved;
   F.   Natural features such as watercourses, trees, and rock outcrops will be
preserved, to the degree possible, so that they can enhance the overall design
of the planned development;
   G.   The layout must be designed to take advantage of the existing land
contours in order to provide satisfactory road gradients and suitable building
lots and to facilitate the provision of proposed services; and
   H.   In any development which is primarily designed for or occupied by
dwellings, all electric and telephone facilities, street light wiring, and
other wiring conduits and similar facilities shall be placed underground by the

needed to make specific determinations.
      3.   Following such study, the Planning Commission or its staff shall
hold a conference or conferences with the applicant to discuss desirable
changes in the first or succeeding drafts of the preliminary development plan
and report;
      4.   Recommendations of the Planning Commission to the applicant shall be
in writing, and following any such conference, agreements between the applicant
and the Planning Commission as to changes in the preliminary plan and report or
other matters are to be recorded and acknowledged by the Planning Commission
and the applicant. On items on which no agreement is reached, or there is
specific disagreement, this fact shall be recorded and the applicant may place
in the record his reasons for any disagreement;
      5.   When the preliminary development plan and report have been approved
in principal (as a whole or with reservations specifically indicated) or when
the applicant indicates in writing that no further negotiations with the
Planning Commission are desired before proceeding, the Planning Commission
shall forward its recommendation and all pertinent materials to the County
Rural Zoning Commission which shall schedule the proposed plan for a public
hearing, following which it shall make its recommendations to the Board of
County Commissioners. Such recommendations shall indicate approval, approval
with reservations, or disapproval with reasons. With such recommendations the
County Rural Zoning Commission shall transmit the latest draft of the

District) and shall be used only in accordance with the uses and densities
shown on the planned development preliminary plan.
   C.   Final plan. The final planned development plan shall conform
substantially to the preliminary plan. If desired by the developer, it may be
submitted in stages with each stage reflecting a portion of the approved
preliminary plan which is proposed to be recorded and developed; provided,
however, that such portion conforms to all requirements of these regulations.
The required procedure for approval of a final plan shall be:
      1.   The final plan and supporting data shall be filed with the Zoning
Inspector who in turn forwards copies to the Planning Commission for
certification that the final plan is in conformity with these regulations and
in agreement with the approved preliminary plan;

§ 814 FP – FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY STANDARDS.
   A.   General provisions.
      1.   Statutory authorization. This section is adopted pursuant to
authorization contained in R.C. §§ 307.37 and 307.85. This resolution adopts
regulations for areas of special flood hazard that are necessary for
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. Therefore, the
Commissioners of Preble County, State of Ohio does ordain as follows.
      2.   Findings of fact. Preble County has special flood hazard areas that
are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
      3.   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
         a.   Protect human life and health;
         b.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
         c.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
         d.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
         e.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
         f.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
         g.   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
         h.   Have no adverse impact on adjacent properties within and near
flood prone areas: No adverse impact (NAI) floodplain management is an approach
that ensures the action of any community does not adversely impact the property
and rights of others. An adverse impact can be measured by an increase in the
flood states, flood velocity, flows, the potential for erosion and
sedimentation, degradation of water quality, or increased cost of public
services. No adverse impact floodplain management extends beyond the floodplain
to include managing development in the watersheds where floodwaters originate.
NAI does not mean no development. It means that any adverse impact caused by a
project must be mitigated, preferably as provided for in the community or in a
watershed based plan;
         i.   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
         j.   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
         k.   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
         l.   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
      4.   Methods of reducing flood loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
         a.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
         b.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
         c.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
         d.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
         e.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers,
which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards
in other areas.
      5.   Lands to which these regulations apply. These regulations shall
apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Preble
County as identified in Section A.6, including any additional areas of special
flood hazard annexed by Preble County.
      6.   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
         a.   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
for Preble County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both effective May 8, 2024.
         b.   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard,
include:
            1)   Information available from the Miami Conservancy District;
            2)   Corps of Engineers Floodplain Information Reports;
            3)   U.S. Geological Survey Flood Prone Quadrangles;
            4)   U.S.D.A. Natural Resources Conservation Service - Flood
Hazard;
            5)   Analyses Studies and County Soil Surveys;
            6)   Ohio Department of Natural Resources - Flood Hazard Reports
and Flood Profile Charts; or
            7)   Other sources acceptable to the Planning Commission.
         c.   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by Preble County as required by Section C.3 Subdivisions and Other New
Developments.
         d.   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations.
Such maps and/or studies are on file at the Preble County Building and Zoning
Office, Courthouse, 101 East Main Street, Eaton, Ohio 45320.
      7.   Abrogation and greater restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing resolutions including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other resolution, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this section and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
      8.   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
         a.   Considered as minimum requirements;
         b.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
         c.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
      9.   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of Preble County, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
      10.   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations
be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision
shall not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part
thereof, other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

      7.   Post-construction certifications required. The following as-built
certifications are required after a floodplain development permit has been
issued:
         a.   For new or substantially improved residential structures, or
nonresidential structures that have been elevated, the applicant shall have a
Federal Emergency Management Agency elevation certificate completed by a
registered professional surveyor to record as-built elevation data. For
elevated structures in Zone A and Zone AO areas without a base flood elevation,
the elevation certificate may be completed by the property owner or owner's
representative.
         b.   For all development activities subject to the standards of
Section B.11.a., a letter of map revision.
         c.   For new or substantially improved nonresidential structures that
have been floodproofed in lieu of elevation, where allowed, the applicant shall
supply a completed floodproofing certificate for non-residential structures
completed by a registered professional engineer or architect together with
associated documentation.
      8.   Revoking a floodplain development permit. A floodplain development
permit shall be revocable, if among other things, the actual development
activity does not conform to the terms of the application and permit granted
thereon. In the event of the revocation of a permit, an appeal may be taken to
the Variance Board in accordance with Section D of these regulations.
      9.   Exemption from filing a development permit. An application for a
floodplain development permit shall not be required for maintenance work such
as roofing, painting, and basement sealing, or for small nonstructural
development activities (except for filling and grading) valued at less than
$2,500.
      10.   State and federal development.
         a.   Development that is funded, financed, undertaken, or preempted by
state agencies shall comply with minimum NFIP criteria.
         b.   Before awarding funding or financing or granting a license,
permit, or other authorization for a development that is or is to be located
within a 100-year floodplain, a state agency shall require the applicant to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the agency that the development will comply
with minimum NFIP criteria and any applicable local floodplain management
resolution or ordinance as required by R.C. § 1521.13. This includes, but is
not limited to:
            1)   Development activities in an existing or proposed manufactured
home park that are under the authority of the Ohio Department of Commerce and
subject to the flood damage reduction provisions of the Ohio Administrative
Code Section 4781-12.
            2)   Major utility facilities permitted by the Ohio Power Siting
Board under R.C. Chapter 4906.
            3)   Hazardous waste disposal facilities permitted by the Hazardous
Waste Siting Board under R.C. Chapter 3734.
         c.   Development activities undertaken by a federal agency and which
are subject to Federal Executive Order 11988 - Floodplain Management.
            1)   Each federal agency has a responsibility to evaluate the
potential effects of any actions it may take in a floodplain; to ensure that
its planning programs and budget request reflect consideration of flood hazards
and floodplain management; and to prescribe procedures to implement the
policies and requirements of EO 11988.
      11.   Map maintenance activities. To meet National Flood Insurance
Program minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA,
and to ensure that Preble County's flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section A.6. accurately represent flooding conditions so
appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on current data, the
following map maintenance activities are identified:
         a.   Requirement to submit new technical data.
            1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway
delineations or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that
technical data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months
of the date such information becomes available. These development proposals
include:
               a)   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
               b)   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed
structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special
flood hazard area;
               c)   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
               d)   Subdivision or other new development proposals requiring
the establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section C.3.
            2)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical
data, required in accordance with Section B.11.a., prepared in a format
required for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
            3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a conditional
letter of map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit
for:
               a)   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base
flood elevation; and
               b)   Proposed development which increases the base flood
elevation by more than one foot in riverine areas where FEMA has provided base
flood elevations but no floodway.
            4)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section B.11.a.1).
         b.   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Commissioners of
Preble County, and may be submitted at any time.
         c.   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of Preble
County have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority
over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain
management regulations for a particular area. In order that Preble County's
Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent Preble County boundaries, include
within such notification a copy of a map of Preble County suitable for
reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for
which Preble County has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
      12.   Data use and flood map interpretation. The following guidelines
shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas
of special flood hazard:
         a.   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard
areas, or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood
elevation and floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain
Administrator shall review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data
available from a federal, state, or other source.
         b.   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
         c.   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section D, Appeals and Variances.
         d.   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this section
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
      13.   Use of preliminary flood insurance rate map and/or flood insurance
study data.
         a.   Zone A:
            1)   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from
the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be reasonably utilized as best available
data.
            2)   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final
flood elevation determination has been provided in a letter of final
determination (LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS
shall be used for regulating development.
         b.   Zones AE, A1-30, AH, and AO:
            1)   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy
are not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
               a)   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have
the responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
               b)   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should
not be used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or
until all appeals have been resolved.
            2)   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where
none had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in
lieu of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section C.9.b. since
the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the best data available.
         c.    Zones B, C, and X: Use of BFE and floodway data from a
preliminary FIRM or FIS are not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or
X on the effective FIRM which are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, or AO.
Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data
to ensure that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are
protected.
      14.   Substantial damage determinations. 
         a.   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes
including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage
event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
            1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special
flood hazard areas;
            2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged
structures located in special flood hazard areas; and
            3)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
         b.   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.
   C.   Use and development standards for flood hazard reduction. The following
use and development standards apply to development wholly within, partially
within, or in contact with any special flood hazard area as established in

      9.   Assurance of flood carrying capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
         a.   Development in floodways.
            1)   In order to promote health, safety, and welfare of the
citizens of Preble County, no development that is for human habitation will be
permitted in floodways.
            2)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to
issuance of a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional
engineer, demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any
increase in the base flood elevation; or
            3)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base

where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated, the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
base flood elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance
of a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
            2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified
by FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
               a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
               b)    Section C.9.a.3), items a) and c) - e).
         c.   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
            1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or
relocated portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the
issuance of a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a
description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated
as a result of the proposed development, and certification by a registered
professional engineer that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the
watercourse will not be diminished.
            2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and
the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified
prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such
notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
            3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Preble County specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
            4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section B.11.a.1)c) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
      10.   Fill. The following standards apply to all fill activities in
special flood hazard areas and must be approved by the County Engineer.
         a.   Fill sites, upon which structures will be constructed or placed,
must be compacted to ninety-five (95) percent of the maximum density obtainable
with the Standards Proctor Test method or an acceptable equivalent method.
         b.   Fill slopes shall not be steeper than one (1) foot vertical to
two (2) feet horizontal.
         c.   Adequate protection against erosion and scour is provided for
fill slopes. When expected velocities during the occurrence of the base flood
of more than five (5) feet per second armoring with stone or rock protection
shall be provided. When expected velocities during base flood are five (5) feet
per second or less, protection shall be provided by covering them with
vegetative cover.
         d.   Fill shall result in no net loss of natural floodplain storage.
The volume of the loss of floodwater storage due to filling in the special
flood hazard area shall be offset by providing an equal volume of flood storage
by excavation or other compensatory measures at or adjacent to the development
site. Maps are required showing location and volume of these areas.
Compensatory storage areas must be:
            1)   Open to the Floodplain Administrator for inspection;
            2)   A permanent component of the property receiving the variance
and must be repaired or replaced by the owner of the property, if silted in or
otherwise compromised;
            3)   Above the water table, i.e. the storage cannot hold water
other than in times of flooding; and
            4)   In the same drainage system.
   D.   Appeals and variances.
      1.   Powers and duties.
         a.   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of
these regulations. The Preble County Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby
appointed to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by

regulations.
      2.   Appeals.
         a.   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within thirty (30) days of the date of such notice and order, or other
official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the
mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's
decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be
filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the
Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the
Appeals Board.
         b.   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix
a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in
interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
      3.   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
         a.   Application for a variance.
            1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance
is sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
            2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
            3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by Preble County,
as determined by the Office of Land Use Management.
         b.   Public hearing.
            1)   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements
and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
               a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others.
               b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
               c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its
contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
               d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
               e)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
               f)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location,
where applicable.
               g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
               h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area.
               i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
               j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
               k)   The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges.
            2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
               a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
               b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
               c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
               d)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
               e)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
            3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of
these regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting
of variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these
regulations.
         c.   Other conditions for variances.
            1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
            2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section D.3.b.1) to 11) have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
            3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
      4.   Appeal to the court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Preble County Court of Common Pleas,
pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506.

§ 901 SCOPE AND APPLICATION.
§ 901.01 SCOPE OF REGULATIONS.
   The off-street parking and loading requirements of this code shall apply as
follows.
   A.   For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date of this code, accessory parking and
loading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations of the
district in which such buildings or uses are located. However, where a building
permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this code and provided
that construction is begun within six (6) months of such effective date and
diligently pursued to completion, parking and loading facilities in the amount
required for the issuance of said building permit may be provided in lieu of
any different amounts required by this code.
   B.   When the intensity of use of any building, structure, or premises shall
be increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating
capacity, or other units of measurement specified herein for required parking
and loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required herein shall
be provided for such increase in intensity of use and for at least fifty (50)
percent of any existing deficiency in parking and loading facilities.
   C.   Whenever the existing use of a building structure shall hereafter be
changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as
required for such new use. However, if the said building or structure was
erected prior to the effective date of this code, additional parking or loading
facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements for the
new use would exceed those for the existing use, if the latter were subject to
the parking and loading provisions of this code.
(Res. 669-94-72, § 901.01, effective 4-5-1995)
§ 901.02 EXISTING PARKING AND LOADING FACILITIES.
   A.   Off-street parking and loading facilities in existence on the effective
date of this code and located on the same lot as the building or use served
shall not hereafter be reduced below, or if already less than, shall not be
further reduced below, the requirements for a similar new building or use under
the provisions of this code.
   B.   Any area once designated as required off-street parking or loading
shall never be changed to any other use unless and until equal facilities are
provided elsewhere.
(Res. 669-94-72, § 901.02, effective 4-5-1995)
§ 902 OFF-STREET PARKING.
§ 902.01 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   A.   Parking requirements. The off-street parking required by this article
shall be provided in accordance with the following requirements.
      1.   One- and two-family dwellings. The off-street parking facilities
required for one- and two- family dwellings should be located on the same lot
or plot of ground as the building they are intended to serve, but shall not be
considered a parking lot under the provisions of this article.
      2.   Multiple-family. The off-street parking facilities for multifamily
dwellings shall consist of a parking lot as defined elsewhere in this article.
In no event shall any uncovered parking space in a multifamily district be
located nearer than ten (10) feet to any main building.
      3.   Mobile home parks. The off-street parking required may be located on
each site or in parking lots conveniently located and readily accessible to
each site.
      4.   Other land uses. The off-street parking required may be located on
each site or in parking lots conveniently located and readily accessible to
each site. Such off-lot spaces shall be located only in districts in which
similar off-street parking is permitted.
      5.   Control of off-site parking facilities. In cases where parking
facilities are permitted on land other than the zoning lot on which the
building or use served is located, such facilities shall be in the same
possession as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the
parking facilities are accessory. Such possession may be either by deed or
long-term lease, the term of said lease to be determined by the Building
Inspector; and such deed or lease shall be filed with the County Recorder. The
deed or lease shall require such owner or his heirs and assigns to maintain the
required number of parking facilities for the duration of the use served or of
the deed or lease, whichever shall terminate sooner.
   B.   Construction requirements.
      1.   Vehicle accommodation areas that either include lanes for drive-in
windows or contain parking areas that are required to have more than ten (10)
parking spaces and that are used regularly at least five (5) days per week
shall be graded and surfaced with asphalt, concrete, or other material that
will provide equivalent protection against potholes, erosion, and dust.
      2.   Vehicle accommodation areas that are not provided with the type of
surface specified in subsection B.1 above shall be graded and surfaced with
crushed stone, gravel, or other suitable material to provide a surface that is
stable and will help to reduce dust and erosion. The perimeter of such parking
areas shall be defined by bricks, stones, railroad ties, or other similar
devices. In addition, whenever such a vehicle accommodation area abuts a paved
street, the driveway leading from such street to such area (or, if there is no
driveway, the portion of the vehicle accommodation area that opens onto such
streets) shall be paved as provided in subsection B.1 above for a distance of
fifteen (15) feet back from the edge of the paved street. This subsection shall
not apply to single-family or two-family residences or other uses that are
required to have only one (1) or two (2) parking spaces.
      3.   Parking spaces in areas surfaced in accordance with subsection B.1
above shall be appropriately demarcated with painted lines or other markings.
Parking spaces in areas surfaced in accordance with subsection B.2 above shall
be demarcated whenever practicable.
      4.   Parking facilities shall be completely constructed prior to a
certificate of occupancy being issued. Each parking facility must meet any
other engineering standards deemed necessary by the Zoning Enforcement Officer
and County Engineer.
   C.   Parking lot plans. Plans for the development of any parking lot must be
submitted to the Zoning Enforcement Officer and County Engineer, prepared at a
scale of not less than fifty (50) feet equals one (1) inch and indicating
existing and proposed grades, drainage, pipe sizes, dimensions of parking
spaces, type of curbing, drive and aisle dimensions, lighting, adjacent main
buildings, sidewalks, landscaping, surfacing, and base materials to be used.
The plans of the proposed parking lot layout shall be prepared in a presentable
form by person or persons competent in such work and shall reflect conformance
with the following provisions.
      1.   Off-street parking spaces.  
         a.   Off-street parking spaces, open to the sky, may be located in any
yard if the parking facility is located within a commercial or industrial zone,
except that when a required nonresidential parking lot or parking area designed
for ten (10) or more vehicles is situated on a parcel which adjoins a
residential district or a residential use, provisions stated in subsection C.2
below shall apply.
         b.   Parking facilities in commercial and industrial districts are
encouraged to be located behind the front yard setback line whenever possible.
      2.   Parking space dimensions.
         a.   Subject to subsections C.2.b and C.2.c below, each parking space
shall contain a rectangular area at least nineteen (19) feet long and nine (9)
feet wide. Lines demarcating parking spaces may be drawn at various angles in
relation to curbs or aisles, so long as the parking spaces so created contain
within them the rectangular area required by this section.
         b.   In parking areas containing ten (10) or more parking spaces, up
to fifteen (15) percent of the parking spaces need contain a rectangular area
of only eight (8) feet in width by sixteen (16) feet in length. If such spaces
are provided, they shall be conspicuously designated as reserved for small or
compact cars only.
         c.   Wherever parking areas consist of space set aside for parallel
parking, the dimensions of such parking spaces shall be not less than twenty
two (22) feet by nine (9) feet.
      3.   Required width of parking area aisles and drainage.
         a.   Parking area aisle widths shall conform to the following table,
which varies the width requirement according to the angle of parking.
 
Parking Angle
Aisle Width     0  30 45 60 90
One-Way Traffic 13 11 13 18 24
Two-Way Traffic 19 20 21 23 24
 
         b.   Driveways shall be not less than ten (10) feet in width for one-
way traffic and eighteen (18) feet in width for two-way traffic, except that
ten (10) foot wide driveways are permissible for two- way traffic when:
            1)   The driveway is not longer than fifty (50) feet;
            2)   It provides access to not more than six (6) spaces; and
            3)   Sufficient turning space is provided so that vehicles need not
back into a public street.
      4.   Screening and landscaping.  
         a.   All open vehicle parking areas containing more than ten (10)
parking spaces shall be effectively screened on each side which adjoins or
faces premises situated in any residential district, or institutional premises,
by a fence or vegetative screening of acceptable design. Such fence shall be
not less than four (4) feet or more than six (6) feet in height and shall be
maintained in good condition without any advertising thereon. The space between
such wall or fence and the lot line of the adjoining premises in any R District
shall be landscaped with grass, hardy shrubs, or evergreen ground cover and
maintained in good condition. In lieu of such wall or fence, a strip of land
not less than ten (10) feet in width and planted and maintained with an
evergreen hedge or dense planting of evergreen shrubs not less than four (4)
feet in height may be substituted.
         b.   When located adjacent to a dedicated public right-of-way,
screening shall not be permitted to obstruct clear vision so as to create a
potential traffic hazard.
      5.   Access and circulation.
         a.   Unless no other practicable alternative is available, vehicle
accommodation areas shall be designed so that, without resorting to
extraordinary movements, vehicles may exit such areas without backing onto a
public street. This requirement does not apply to parking areas consisting of
driveways that serve one (1) or two (2) dwelling units, although backing onto
arterial streets is discouraged.
         b.   Vehicle accommodation areas of all developments shall be designed
so that sanitation, emergency, and other public service vehicles can serve such
developments without the necessity of backing unreasonable distances or making
other dangerous or hazardous turning movements.
         c.   Every vehicle accommodation area shall be designed so that
vehicles cannot extend beyond the perimeter of such area onto adjacent
properties or public rights-of-way. Such areas shall also be designed so that
vehicles do not extend over sidewalks or tend to bump against or damage any
wall, vegetation, or other obstruction.
         d.   Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed
safely without posing a danger to pedestrians or other vehicles and without
interfering with parking areas.
         e.   Ingress and egress to a parking lot lying in an area zoned for
other than single-family residential use shall not be across land zoned for
single-family residential use.

be subject to Preble County Zoning and shall be subject to the following
conditions:
         a.   Height - The maximum height of any turbine shall be 125 feet. For
purposes of this resolution, maximum height shall be considered the total
height of the turbine system including the tower, and the maximum vertical
height of the turbine’s blades. Maximum height therefore shall be calculated by
measuring the length of a prop at maximum vertical rotation to the ground level
of the tower. However, if the height is over 125 feet, it will require a
conditional use permit be granted by the Preble County Board of Zoning Appeals.
         b.   Setbacks - The following shall apply in regards to setbacks.
            1)   Any turbine erected on a parcel of land shall be setback to
establish a “clear fall zone”, from all road right-of-way lines, overhead
utility lines, neighboring property lines, and any inhabited structures on the
parcel intended for the turbine. Hence, a turbine shall be erected and placed
in such a manner that if it were to fall, whatever direction the fall occurs
would be contained solely on the property where the turbine is located at and
would not strike any structures including the primary dwelling, and any
inhabited structures. The setback shall be a minimum of 1.1 times the height of
the turbine.
            2)   Any turbine erected shall be no closer to the front property
line than the primary dwelling; this shall not apply to any property that is
zoned Agricultural under §
801 .
         c.   Maintenance - Wind turbines must be maintained in good working
order. The owner shall within 30 days of permanently ceasing operation of a
wind turbine, provide written notice of abandonment to the Zoning Inspector. An
unused wind turbine or small wind project may stand no longer than 12 months
following abandonment. All costs associated with the demolition of the wind
turbine and associated equipment shall be borne by the owner. A wind turbine is
considered abandoned when it ceases transmission of electricity for 90
consecutive days. Wind turbines that become inoperable for more than 12 months
must be removed by the owner within 30 days of issuance of zoning violation.
Removal includes removal of all apparatuses, above ground supports, and or
other hardware associated with the existing wind turbine.
         d.   Decibel levels - All units shall operate within a decibel range
of 50 to 70 decibels. This information shall be included in the engineering
report described below in subsection 3. This information shall be obtained from
the manufacturer of the turbine, and all decibel readings, if necessary, shall
be taken from the nearest neighboring property.
         e.   Wiring and electrical apparatuses - All wires and electrical
apparatuses associated with the operation of a wind turbine unit shall be
located underground and meet all applicable local, state, and federal codes
including the County Building Regulations and Residential Building Code of
Ohio.

operations involved in or conducted in connection with it, its size layout, and
its relation to streets giving access to it shall be such that vehicular
traffic to and from the use will not be more hazardous than the normal traffic
of the district, both at the time and as the same may be expected to increase
with increasing development of the municipality, taking into account vehicular
turning movements in relation to routes of traffic flow, relation to street
intersections, sight distances, and relation to pedestrian traffic.
      2.   The nature, location, size, and site layout of the use shall be such
that it will be a harmonious part of the business or industrial district in
which it is situated, taking into account prevailing shopping habits,
convenience of access by perspective patrons, the physical and economic
relationships of one (1) type of use to another, and characteristic groupings
of uses in a commercial or industrial district.

§ 1201 PURPOSE.
   This code establishes separate districts, each of which is an appropriate
area for the location of the uses which are permitted in that district. Within
such established districts as well as those which may be established by future
amendments, there are and will be lots, uses of land, structures, and uses of
structures and land in combination which were lawful before this code was
passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted
under the terms of this code or future amendments. Since such nonconformities
are deemed incompatible with the districts in which they are located, it is the
intent of this article to specify those circumstances and conditions under
which such nonconformities shall be permitted to continue, but not to encourage
their survival. Rather, it is the intent of this code to encourage either the
conversion of nonconforming uses into conforming uses as soon as reasonably
possible or encourage their eventual and equitable elimination.

§ 1202 RESTRICTIONS ON NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES, AND USES.
§ 1202.01 GENERAL.
   Any nonconforming lot, structure, or use which existed lawfully at the time
of the adoption of this code and which remains nonconforming, as well as any
which shall be nonconforming upon any subsequent amendments thereto, may be
continued but shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, nor be used as
grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district. No additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises shall
be utilized in conjunction with nonconforming uses of land or structures shall
be permitted upon passage of this code.
(Res. 669-94-72, § 1202.01, effective 4-5-1995)
§ 1202.02 SINGLE NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-
family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on a single
lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this code. Such lots
must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in
the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to
meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable
in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than
those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the
regulations for the district in which such lots is located. Variances of
requirements listed in Articles VIII and IX of this code other than lot area or
lot width shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Zoning Appeals
as provided in §§
1404 through 1409.

   If two (2) or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this code, and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not
meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved
shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this code,
and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which
diminishes compliance with lot widths and area requirements established by this
code, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with a
width or area below the requirements stated in this code.

§ 1202.04 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, at the time of adoption of this code, lawful uses of land exist which
would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this code, the uses may be
continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided:
   A.   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this code;
   B.   No such nonconforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this code;
   C.   If any such nonconforming uses of land are discontinued or abandoned
for more than two (2) years (except when government action impedes access to
the premises), any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations
specified by this code for the district in which such land is located; and
   D.   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this code
shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.

§ 1202.05 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this code that could not be built under the terms of this code by
reasons of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on
the lot, bulk, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure
may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:
   A.   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity;
   B.   Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means, it shall not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the provision of this code; and
   C.   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.

in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
code, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
   A.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this code in
the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located;
   B.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this code, but no such use shall be extended to occupy
any land outside such building;
   C.   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure or structure and land, may, upon appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals, be changed to another nonconforming use, provided that the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more
appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting
such change, the Board of Zoning Appeals may require appropriate conditions and
safeguards in accord with other provisions of the resolution;
   D.   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed;
   E.   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for more than two (2) years (except
when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure or
structure and land in combination shall not thereafter be used except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located; and
   F.   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.

nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or
replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided that
the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order by
such official.
(Res. 669-94-72, § 1202.09, effective 4-5-1995)
§ 1202.10 RESTORATION.
   Whenever a building, the use of which does not conform to the provisions of
this code, is damaged by fire, explosion, or act of God to the extent of sixty
(60) percent or more of its accessed value, it shall not be restored except in
conformity with the district regulations of the district in which it is
located.

shall not be reestablished, and any further use shall be in conformity with the
provisions of this code.

§ 1401 GENERAL.
   Appeals and variances shall conform to the procedures and requirements of §§
1402 through
1409, inclusive, of this code. As specified in §
1511, the Board of Zoning Appeals has appellate jurisdiction relative to
appeals and variances.

§ 1402 APPEALS.
   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals concerning interpretation or
administration of this code may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any
officer of the legislative authority of the county affected by any decision of
the Zoning Inspector. Such appeal shall be taken within twenty (20) days after
the decision by filing, with the Zoning Enforcement Office and with the Board
of Zoning Appeals, a notice of appeal specifying the grounds upon which the
appeal is being taken. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall transmit to the
Board of Zoning Appeals all the papers constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from was taken.
(Res. 669-94-72, § 1402, effective 4-5-1995)

   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,
unless the Zoning Enforcement Officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies
to the Board of Zoning Appeals, after the notice of appeal is filed with him,
that by reason of facts stated in the application a stay would, in his opinion,
cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not
be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board
of Zoning Appeals or by a court of record on application, on notice to the
Zoning Enforcement Office from whom the appeal is taken on due cause shown.

   A.   The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon appeal in specific cases
such variance from the terms of this code as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owning to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this code would result in unnecessary hardship. No nonconforming
use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be
considered grounds for issuance of a variance. Variances shall not be granted
on the grounds of convenience or profit, but only where strict application of
the provisions of this code would result in unnecessary hardship.
   B.   If a pre-existing structure encroaches upon any set-back and the
applicant wishes to construct an addition to that structure that does not
further encroach upon that set-back, there will be no variance needed to obtain
a zoning permit.

§ 1404.01 APPLICATION AND STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not vary the regulations of this code, as
authorized in §
1404, unless and until a written application for a variance is submitted to the
Zoning Enforcement Officer and the Board of Zoning Appeals containing:
   A.   Name, address, and phone number of applicants;
   B.   Legal description of property;
   C.   Description of nature of variance requested; and
   D.   Narrative statements which demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board
of Zoning Appeals that the variance conforms to the following standards:
      1.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience
if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out;
      2.   The conditions upon which an application for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification;
      3.   The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a desire
to increase financial gain;
      4.   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this code and has
not been created by any persons presently having an interest in the property;
      5.   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in
which the property is located;
      6.   The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion of the
public streets, or increase the damage of fire, or endanger the public safety,
or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood;
and
      7.   The Board of Zoning Appeals may impose such conditions and
restrictions upon the premises benefitted by a variance as may be necessary to
comply with the standards established in this section and the objectives of
this code.
(Res. 669-94-72, § 1404.01, effective 4-5-1995; Res. effective - -1995; Res.
80-13-159, effective 7-5-2013)
§ 1405 AUTHORIZED VARIANCES.
   A.   Variances from the regulations of this code shall not be granted unless
the Board makes specific findings of fact based directly on the particular
evidence presented to it, which supports conclusions that the standards and
conditions impose in §
1404.01 above have been met by the applicant. Variances may be granted as
guided by the following:
      1.   To permit any yard or setback less than the yard or setback required
by the applicable regulations;
      2.   To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited
solely because of the insufficient area or width of the lot or lots, but
generally the respective area and width of the lot or lots should not be less
than eighty (80) percent of the required area and width;
      3.   To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as
required facilities for two (2) or more uses, provided that substantial use of
such facility by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours
of the same days of the week;
      4.   To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading facilities
required by generally not more than one (1) parking space or loading space, or
twenty five (25) percent of the required facilities, whichever number is
greater;
      5.   To allow for the deferment of required parking facilities for a
reasonable period of time, such period of time to be specified in the variance;
      6.   To increase the maximum distance that required parking spaces are
permitted to be located from the use served but generally not more than forty
(40) percent;
      7.   To increase the maximum allowable size or area of signs on a lot but
generally by no more than twenty five (25) percent;
      8.   To increase the maximum gross floor area of any use so limited by
the applicable regulations but generally not more than twenty (25) percent; and
      9.   To modify the supplemental yard and height regulations found in §
817.
   B.   No order of the Board of Zoning Appeals granting a variance shall be
valid for a period longer than twelve (12) months from the date of such order
unless the building permit or zoning approval is obtained with such period and
the erection or alteration of a building is started or the use is commenced
within such period.

§ 1406 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Zoning Appeals grant an appeal or
variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this code in the
district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the
terms of this code in said district. In granting any appeal or variance, the
Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in
conformity with the resolution. Violation of such conditions and safeguards,
when made a part of the terms under which the appeal or variance is granted,

broken down into the following categories:
         1.   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special
flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map
and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood
hazard area.
         2.   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
         3.   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A comment by FEMA
regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the
hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in
the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood
elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does not amend or revise
effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, or flood
insurance studies.
      LINE, PROPERTY. The boundary of any lot, parcel, or tract, as the same is

this code shall have no REAR LOT LINE.
         3.   SIDE LOT LINE. Any lot line other than the front lot line or rear
lot line. A SIDE LOT LINE separating a lot from a street is a side street lot
line. A SIDE LOT LINE separating a lot from another lot or lots is an interior
side lot line.
      LOT MEASUREMENTS. A lot shall be measured as follows:
         1.   DEPTH. The distance between the midpoints of straight lines
connecting the foremost points of the side lot lines in front and the rearmost
points of the side lot lines in the rear; and
         2.   WIDTH. The distance between straight lines connecting front and
rear lot lines at each side of the lot, measured at the building setback line.

      LOT OF RECORD. A lot which is part of a subdivision recorded in the
office of the County Recorder, or a lot or parcel described by metes and
bounds, the description of which has been so recorded.
      LOT TYPES. Terminology used in this code with reference to corner lots,
interior lots, and through lots is as follows.
         1.   CORNER LOT. A lot located at the intersection of two (2) or more
streets. A lot abutting on a curved street or streets shall be considered a

lines to the foremost point of the lot meet at an interior angle of less than
one hundred thirty five degrees.
         2.   INTERIOR LOT. A lot with only one (1) frontage on a street.
         3.   REVERSED FRONTAGE LOT.  A lot on which frontage is at right
angles to the general pattern in the area. A REVERSED FRONTAGE LOT may also be
a corner lot.

a MANUFACTURED HOME PARK means any tract of land upon which three or more
manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or
for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle,
or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A
tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or
rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three (3) or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority. MANUFACTURED HOME PARK does not
include any tract of land used solely for the storage or display for sale of
manufactured homes.

      MEAN SEA LEVEL. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are

      NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The NFIP is a federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
      NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by
Preble County and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For

regulations of the district or zone in which it is situated.
      NUISANCE. Anything that interferes with the use or enjoyment of property,
endangers personal health or safety, or is offensive to the senses. There are
many types of nuisances, and the law can be invoked to determine when, in fact,
a nuisance exists and should be abated. NUISANCE law forms part of the basis
for zoning. The separation of uses through zoning, e.g., industrial from
residential, helps to foster the enjoyment of residential areas free from
pollution, noise, congestion, and the other characteristics of industrial
areas. Performance standards, which are better able to measure  degree of
NUISANCE, have been developed as a way of dealing with activities by the way
they perform, rather than as classes.

conservator, trustee, or guardian of the estate of the OWNER. Any such person
thus representing the actual OWNER shall be bound to comply with the provisions
of this code and of rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, to the same
extent as if he were the OWNER.

guaranteeing the completion of physical improvements according to plans and
specifications within the time prescribed by the subdivider’s agreement.
      PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. A minimum requirement or maximum allowable limit
on the effects or characteristics of a use, usually written in the form of
regulatory language. A building code, for example, might specify a PERFORMANCE
STANDARD referring to the fire resistance of a wall, rather than specifying its
construction materials. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS in zoning might describe
allowable uses with respect to smoke, odor, noise, heat, vibration, glare,
traffic generation, visual impact, and so on, instead of the more traditional
classifications of “light” or “heavy” lists of uses. It is a more precise way
of defining compatibility and at the same time is intended to expand
developers’ options.

as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to,
any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or

streets, utilities, lots or building sites, site plans, and design principles
for all buildings as intended to be located, constructed, used, and related to
each other, and for other uses and improvements on the land as related to
buildings. Development may be a single operation or a definitely programmed
series of development operations including all lands and buildings, with a
program for provision, operation, and maintenance of such areas, improvements,
and facilities necessary for common use by the occupants of the development.
      PLANNING COMMISSION. The Planning Commission of the county.
      POLICE POWER. The authority of government to exercise controls to protect
the public’s health, safety, morals, and general welfare. As distinct from
eminent domain powers, in which government takes property, no compensation need

exercise becomes, in effect, a taking of property, is a question of long
standing and has arisen again lately in connection with the restrictive growth
management controls being imposed by many communities.
      POLICY. A statement or document of a public body that forms the basis for
enacting legislation or making decisions. The POLICIES under which zoning
resolutions are enacted and administered should be found in a community’s
comprehensive plan. A common charge leveled at zoning bodies is that their
decisions are ad hoc, i.e., they are made independent of one another and have
no basis in publicly established POLICY.
      POLICY PLAN. A plan adopted by the Board of County Commissioners to serve
as a guide for public decision making in regards to future development by
establishing goals, objectives, and policies for the county.

commercial buildings, hospitals, and day care facilities. PRIMARY STRUCTURES
exclude structures such as hunting sheds, storage sheds, pool houses,
unattached garages, and barns.
      PRIVATE NON-COMMERCIAL SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM. Private or non-commercial
solar energy systems include building-mounted or ground-mounted systems that
provide power for the principal use and/or accessory use of the property on
which the system is located. These systems shall not be designed for the

in the map, i.e., the zoning designation of a particular parcel or parcels. The
last, so-called small parcel REZONING, has often been used to add flexibility
to the zoning process, usually unintentionally. (One form of text change, the
importance of which may be unrecognized, is a change in a definition. For
example, changing the definition of townhouses to include them under
multifamily or single-family dwellings may significantly affect where and how
they are permitted.) REZONINGS, like the enactment of the original resolution,
are legislative acts that, except under rare and specifically defined
circumstances, cannot be delegated to administrative officials.

      SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Also known as AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD,
it is land in the floodplain subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year.
         1.   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood insurance
studies, flood boundary and floodway maps, and flood hazard boundary maps as
Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS may also refer
to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal state of local
sources of data, including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
         2.   Any area outside the FEMA-studied areas lying along blue-line

as shown on the County Flood Prone Soils Map shall also be considered SPECIAL
FLOOD HAZARD AREAS.
      SPOT ZONING. Zoning a relatively small area differently from the zoning
of the surrounding area, usually for an incompatible use and to favor the owner
of a particular piece or pieces of property. SPOT ZONING is invalidated by the
courts when it violates “in accordance with a comprehensive plan”, is in the
arbitrary and inappropriate nature of the change rather than, as is commonly
believed, in the size of the area. SPOT ZONING often is a reason why many
flexible techniques such as floating zones or conditional rezoning have been
prohibited, the argument being that conferring narrow development permission is
a form of SPOT ZONING. Special small area zoning districts, however, have been
upheld where the comprehensive plan demonstrates a special need, such as for a
historic area or to preserve a sensitive natural area. SPOT ZONING, in sum, can
be legal or illegal, but lay persons generally think that it always is illegal
and use the term loosely and with prejudice at public hearing when they oppose
the change.
      STABLE, COMMERCIAL. A building with more than four (4) stalls for horses
not owned by the owner of the stable.
      STABLE, PRIVATE. Any building, incidental to an existing residential

      STACKING. The area of a parking lot used for the temporary storage of
vehicles at ingress and egress points of a premises or drive-through aisles for
uses such as drive-through banking, fast-food restaurants, and convenience
stores.
      START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180)
days of the permit date. The ACTUAL START means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
      STATEMENT OF INTENT (STATEMENT OF PURPOSE).  A statement of policy or
objectives, often incorporated in a zoning resolution, which outlines the broad
purpose of the resolution and its relationship to the comprehensive plan;
frequently, a statement preceding regulations for individual districts, which
helps to characterize the districts, and their legislative purpose. When the
application of particular district requirements is challenged in court, the
courts rely on the INTENT STATEMENT in deciding whether the application is
reasonable and related to a defensible public purpose. As zoning resolutions
become more complex, with numerous special districts and flexible applications,
STATEMENTS OF INTENT, which guide users, administrative officials, and the
courts, are making more frequent appearances.
      STORY. The part of a building, except a mezzanine, included between the
surface of one (1) floor and the surface of the next floor, or if there is no
floor above, then the ceiling next above. A STORY thus defined shall not be
counted as a STORY when more than fifty (50) percent, by cubic content, is
below the height level of the adjoining ground.
      STREET. See THOROUGHFARE.
      STREET, CENTERLINE OF. The true centerline of a dedicated public right-
of-way as determined by the County Engineer. Where such public right-of-way is
curved, offset, angular, or any other questions arise, the County Engineer
shall determine the alignment of the centerline.
      STREET RIGHT-OF-WAY. See RIGHT-OF-WAY.
      STREET WIDTH. The horizontal distance between right-of-way lines.
      STRIP ZONING.
         1.   A zone normally consisting of a ribbon of uses fronting both
sides of an arterial roadway and extending inward for half a block. Strip
commercial development is the most common form and occurs naturally everywhere.
In suburban areas or along well traveled roads, it is usually characterized by
an assortment of gas stations, drive-in and fast-food restaurants, motels,
tourist shops, and some automobile sales and service operations. In fringe
areas, such uses may be interspersed with a few farms and farm service outlets
like feed distributors and large equipment sales; unlimited highway access to
such uses severally reduces road-carrying capacity. And in older
municipalities, strips of convenience stores and other retail stores are found
scattered within residential neighborhoods.
         2.   STRIP ZONING is a recognition that since such development will
not go away, its most irksome characteristics should be controlled. These
include access, use limitations, parking, signs, some development standards,
and occasionally, though seldom successfully, clustering requirements and
aesthetic controls.
      STRUCTURE.  
         1.   A combination of materials to form a construction for use,
occupancy, or ornamentation whether installed on, above, or below the surface
of land or water, including but not limited to buildings, mobile homes, walls,
fences, and ground signs.

814, floodplain overlay standards, a STRUCTURE is a walled and roofed building,
manufactured home, or gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above

and public utility property, into two (2) or more parcels, sites, or lots, any
one (1) of which is less than five (5) acres for the purpose, whether immediate
or future, of transfer of ownership, provided, however, that the following are
exempt:
            (a)   A division or partition of land into parcels of more than
five (5) acres not involving any new streets or easements of access:
            (b)   The sale or exchange of parcels between adjoining lot owners,
where that sale or exchange does not create additional building sites:
         2.   The improvement of one (1) or more parcels of land for
residential, commercial, or industrial structures or groups of structures
involving the division or allocation of land for the opening, widening, or
extension of any public or private street or streets, except private streets
serving industrial structures, or involving the division or allocation of land
as open spaces for common use by owners, occupants, or leaseholders, or as
easements for the extension and maintenance of public or private sewer, water,
storm drainage, or other similar facilities. See SUBDIVISION, MINOR.

completely subdivided as the original tract existed on February 13, 2006) are
involved; and
         4.   The request for division is not contrary to platting,
subdividing, zoning, health, sanitary or access management regulations.
      SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
      SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
(50) percent of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
         1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
         2.   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
      SUMMER KITCHEN. A small building or shed or screened-in room that is
adjacent to the recreational vehicle and is used only in the summer.
      SUPPLY YARDS. A commercial establishment storing and offering for sale

      VESTED RIGHT.
         1.   A right is VESTED when it has become absolute and fixed and
cannot be defeated or denied by subsequent conditions or change in regulations,
unless it is taken and paid for. There is no VESTED RIGHT to an existing zoning
classification or to have zoning remain the same forever. However, once
development has been started or has been completed, there is a right to
maintain that particular use regardless of the classification given the
property. In order for a nonconforming use to earn the right to continue when
the zoning is changed, the right must have been VESTED before the change. If
the right to complete the development has not been VESTED, it may not be built,
no nonconforming use will be established, and the new regulations will have to
be complied with.
         2.   VESTED RIGHTS are often established by showing that some
development permit has been obtained and substantial construction improvements
must have been completed before the rights are VESTED varies among the states.
In some states application for a building permit or other development approval
may be sufficient to establish a VESTED RIGHT to complete a project. Others may
require substantial investment and beginning of construction on the land, with
completion of structures that are unique to the planned project. See also
NONCONFORMITIES.
