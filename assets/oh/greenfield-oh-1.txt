EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;

liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

child, step-child, parent, grandparent, brother, sister, brother-in-law,
sister-in-law, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law,

(Ord. 23-17. Passed 11-15-17.)
151.08  HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME.
   (a)    Pay Classifications.
      (1)   "Non-exempt employees" are employees who work in positions that the
Village has determined are not exempt from overtime pay requirements under
state and federal law.
      (2)   "Exempt employees" are employees who work in positions that the
Village has determined are exempt from overtime pay requirements under state
and federal law. An exempt employee's fixed salary represents payment for all
hours he or she may be required to work in any given workweek, regardless of
the actual number of hours worked. Exempt employees may work different hours in
any given workweek. No additional payments will be generated simply for working
more hours. Any deductions from an exempt employee's salary will be made in
accordance with state and federal law.
   (b)   Recording Hours Worked.
      (1)   The Village provides its non-exempt employees with a system for
keeping track of their hours worked. Non-exempt employees must keep accurate
and complete records on that system of all the hours they work, including any
time worked over the employee's normal schedule. They must also record any meal
breaks during which they performed no work or any absences.
      (2)   Non-exempt employees may not work "off-the-clock"-working without
recording the work hours. All time worked must be included on time records for
the day when the hours were actually worked. If you are aware or believe that a
non-exempt coworker is working off-the-clock, you must report it to your
Supervisor.
      (3)   No non-exempt employee may work overtime hours without supervisor
approval.
      (4)   Although the Village will pay non-exempt employees for all hours
worked, these employees must have all hours pre-approved by their supervisor
before working the hours. An employee may be subject to discipline, up to and
including termination, for working without pre-approval. Please remember that
it is also a disciplinary infraction to work any hours off-the-clock.
      (5)   An employee who fails to properly keep time records may be subject
to disciplinary action up to and including termination. Supervisors will also
be disciplined for falsifying time records for any other employee or for
instructing another individual to falsify time records.
   (c)   Non-exempt Employee normal work period/cycle:
      (1)   The normal work period of Non-safety Employees shall be 40 hours in
active pay status in five (5) consecutive eight (8) hour days, exclusive of the
time allotted for meals. Active pay status is defined in Section 151.08(g).
Work performed by Non-safety Employees that is in excess of 40 hours in any
seven (7) consecutive calendar day period as established by the Employer shall
be compensated for at the rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the Employee's
regular hourly pay rate. There shall be no pyramiding of overtime for the same
hours worked.
      (2)   The normal work period of the Chief of Police shall be 40 hours in
active pay status in five (5) consecutive eight (8) hour days, including time
allotted for meals. Active pay status is defined in Section
151.08(g). Work performed by the Chief of Police that is in excess of 40 hours
in any seven (7) consecutive calendar day period as established by the Employer
shall be compensated for at the rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the
Employee's regular hourly pay rate. There shall be no pyramiding of overtime
for the same hours worked.
      (3)   The normal work cycle for Patrol Officers and Sergeants shall
consist of a 14 consecutive day period beginning at 12:01 a.m. Sunday and
ending on mid-night Saturday. During this time, Employees shall work 80 hours
with four (4) days off. Days off shall be scheduled so that an Employee shall
have a least two (2) consecutive days off during this time period. Any hours in
excess of 80 within the 14 day work period or in excess of the Employee's daily
work schedule shall be compensated at the time and one-half (1.5) rate of pay.
If the Employer schedules more than two (2) shifts in any 24 hour period more
than twice within any 14 day work period, the overtime rate shall be paid for
any excess shifts. There shall be no pyramiding of overtime for the same hours
worked. Except in an emergency, no Employee shall be required to work patrol
duty more than sixteen (16) consecutive hours without a minimum eight (8) hour
(unpaid) break. Employees may, at their discretion work more than sixteen (16)
consecutive hours if they are capable.
      (4)   The normal work cycle for Employees in the classification of
Dispatcher shall consist of a seven (7) consecutive day period beginning at 12:
01 a.m. Sunday and ending midnight Saturday. During this time Employees shall
work 40 hours with two (2) days off. Days off shall be scheduled so that an
Employee shall have a least two (2) consecutive days off during any two (2)
consecutive seven (7) day work periods. Any hours in excess of 40 within the
seven (7) day work period or in excess of the Employee's daily work schedule
shall be compensated at the time and one-half (1.5) rate of pay. If the
Employer schedules more than two (2) shifts in any 24 hour period more than
once within any two (2) consecutive seven (7) day work period, the overtime
rate shall be paid for any such excess shifts. There shall be no pyramiding of
overtime for the same hours worked.
         (Ord. 23-17. Passed 11-15-17.)
   (d)   Accumulated Overtime:  All Employees shall be permitted to accumulate
overtime as Compensatory time, up to 120 hours for all work performed on
holidays, overtime, call-in etc. On the last day of the last full pay period in
October of each year, any accumulated but unused Compensatory time up to a
maximum of 80 hours will be calculated and paid to the Employee as a separate
disbursement on the 1st day of November, 2023 at their current rate of pay and
any remaining hours shall be carried forward to become part of the 120 hour
accumulation for the next year. This will be a separate check issued to the
Employee for the unused Compensatory time referenced herein. Employee must
provide a written request to the appropriate department head as far in advance
as possible. The granting of and the scheduling of compensatory time off shall
be solely at the discretion of the Employer. The granting of compensatory time
off shall not be detrimental to the efficient and economical operation of the
department, and shall not create an overtime situation. Compensatory time off
may be used in two (2) hour increments, and can be used in consecutive
multiples of two (2) hours. Compensatory time off that has been granted and
scheduled shall not be canceled by the Employer except when unanticipated needs
of the Employer would require it. All unused compensatory time is paid out in
the event of the Employees' death to the Employee's estate.
(Ord. 38-2023. Passed 12-11-23.)
   (e)   Call In: Whenever an Employee is called to work at a time other than
his regular work schedule, thereby necessitating additional travel to and from
work, he/she shall be guaranteed at least two (2) hours pay at the overtime
rate. It is understood that any call-in which starts prior to the regular shift
and continues into the Employee's regular shift or time worked immediately
following the regular shift, shall not be eligible for the minimum of two (2)
hours pay.
   (f)   Court Appearance Call In: When a Safety Employee is required to attend
court or a prosecutor's hearing at a time other than his/her regular work hours
he/she shall be guaranteed at least two (2) hours pay at the overtime rate. The
minimum shall not apply to hours that abut regular work hours. When a call-in
is for the purpose of a court appearance at any court that is located in excess
of fifteen (15) miles from the police station, the Employee shall be paid one
(1) hour travel time in addition to the time actually spent in such court
appearance. If such court appearance is less than two (2) hours, then the
Employee shall be paid one (1) hour for travel time plus two (2) hours for
court appearance. Proof of length of time actually spent in court must be
provided by the Employee prior to the payment of any travel time provided for
in this Section.
   (g)   Active Pay Status definition:  For the purpose of Chapter
151 of the Greenfield Codified Ordinance Code, active pay status shall include
hours actually worked, vacation leave, compensatory time, sick leave, personal
leave, funeral leave, holidays, occupational injury leave, paid absence day,
Police Memorial day, floating holiday, but shall exclude leave of absence,

year, to two (2) personal days of leave with pay each calendar year.

the Employee's first anniversary date and the next regularly scheduled
distribution date.
      (6)   Clothing items specifically required by the Employer shall be
purchased, maintained and worn by each Employee on each day he works. Failure
to wear the proper uniform or clothing and/or failure to maintain the proper
clothing in a clean and presentable manner and/or in proper repair shall be
grounds for disciplinary action.
      (7)   Any patches or insignia required by the Employer to be worn on any
clothing will be selected by and paid for by the Employer, and will be placed
on the clothing by the Employee in a location and manner as required by the
Employer. No other patch, button, or insignia may be worn without permission of
the Employer.
 
   (b)   Safety Employees:
      (1)   Newly hired Employees will be provided with uniform/equipment items
in a quantity and style as specified by the Employer during their first year of
employment.
      (2)   On the first business day of each year, the Village will establish
a purchase order in the amount of Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars ($750) per
Employee, which will be administered by the Chief of Police. The Employee will
use that account to replace equipment or purchase other equipment approved by
the Chief of Police. The Chief will have the ultimate authority to dictate the
quality, type, and condition of equipment/uniforms. The Chief of Police will
also have inventory control. Any uniform allotment monies not spent or
encumbered by the fiscal year end will revert back to the Village. The
Employees may carryover one year's full uniform allotment ($750) to the
following year. The Employee must make notification to the Chief of Police by
December 1st of the prior year of their desire to carryover their full uniform
allotment.
      (3)   Uniforms shall be of a style as specified by the Employer. Any
additional required uniform or equipment items shall be supplied by the
Employer at the Employer's expense.
      (4)   Employees may only use the uniform/equipment allowance for

charged to the Employee's uniform allowance unless agreed to by the Employee.
Employees shall be required to wear issued body armor while working patrol
duties. (Ord. 23-17. Passed 11-15-17.)
151.11 OCCUPATIONAL INJURY LEAVE
   (a)   This section outlines the conditions under which Occupational Injury
(OI) leave may be granted by the Employer and the procedures for administering
its use. Initially OI leave shall not be available until after a disability has
extended beyond five (5) work days. The first five (5) days of absence shall be
charged to sick leave.
   (b)   Any Employee who becomes unable to perform duties as assigned by the
Employer due to a physical injury or illness suffered in the discharge or
performance of his/her official duties, with the exception of gross negligence
or intentional self-injury, shall be placed on OI leave after the five (5) work
days discussed in (a) of this Section. The Employee will continue to receive
his regular straight time daily rate of pay (the base rate of pay) less the
amount of any compensation received by the Employee from any other governmental
unit or agency due to said injury or illness during such period of injury or
illness. The pay received by the Employee from the Employer under this Section
constitutes an advancement of workers' compensation, not salary or wages.
However, an Employee on leave under this Section is considered in active pay
status as defined in Section
151.08(g). OI leave will continue for a period not to exceed ninety (90)
calendar days, without using any accumulated leave. The Employer, based solely
upon specific medical evidence for each individual case, may extend an OI leave
for whatever time necessary.
 
   (c)   The Employee must cooperate in filing a claim for Workers'
Compensation in order to be eligible for OI leave payments. In the event the
claim is denied by Workers' Compensation, the Employee shall revert to sick
leave status, and shall be charged with sick leave, compensatory time, and/or
vacation leave for all OI leave time paid by the Employer, unless the Employee
appeals the claim under the following conditions: The Employee may take his or
her claim of occupational injury to any physician within the Village health
insurance network, who is not the Employee's personal physician. The physician
then will make a determination as to whether the Employee has actually
sustained a work-related injury or illness. The physician's determination is
controlling as to whether such time will be considered OI leave time or whether
such time will revert to other leave as provided above.
   (d)   An Employee applying for an OI leave shall authorize the release to
the Employer of all medical information, pertinent only to the occupational
injury or illness, possessed by the Employee's treating physician(s) and
treatment facility(ies), if so requested by the Employer or his designee. In
addition, the Employer has the right to review the Employee's physical and
mental status each thirty (30) days of absence in order to determine the
Employee's ability to return to work. Such examination shall be conducted by a
physician appointed by the Employer and at the Employer's expense.
   (e)   The Employer may assign the Employee to light duty with the approval
of, and within the limitation set by, the Employee's treating physician. The
Employer will determine if light duty work is available.
   (f)   The Employer may provide this benefit to the Employee through income
protection insurance or by any other means available to the Employer. In the
event this benefit is provided through the purchase of income protection
insurance, the Employee shall meet all the requirements of such insurance
policy to receive OI leave pay. The cost of such insurance shall be at the
Employer's expense. Such income protection shall not impact the Employee's (or
the Employer's) contributions to OPERS or OP&F retirement systems.
(Ord. 23-17. Passed 11-15-17.)
151.12 RETIREMENT SEPARATION.
   (a)   Employees within twelve (12) months of retirement shall be allotted a
maximum of one (1) working day at departmental expense to travel to OPERS or
OP&F to correlate any retirement related affair. Verification of attendance may
be required by the Employer.
   (b)   In the event that the Employee declines to retire, any leave time
taken regarding this Section shall be converted to any authorized paid leave
from accumulated compensatory time, vacation time, personal leave or holiday
leave time available to the Employee.
(Ord. 23-17. Passed 11-15-17.)
151.13 EDUCATION PAY.
   Village Employees may receive Education Pay of $250 for each position
related college course (i.e. criminal justice, law, political science, business
management, psychology, etc.) resulting in a college degree (i.e. Associates
Degree, Bachelor's Degree, Master's Degree and Doctorate Degree). To receive
this Education Pay, the program of study must be approved by the City Manager
prior to enrollment and the degree must be earned while employed by the
Village. (Ord. 23-17. Passed 11-15-17.)
151.14  EMPLOYMENT OF PERSONS WHO HAVE RETIRED UNDER STATE RETIREMENT SYSTEM.
   (a)   The City Manager is hereby authorized to employ persons who have
retired under the State of Ohio retirement system (hereafter referred to as
"retirees") according to the provisions of this section.
   (b)   The City Manager may not employ retirees on a full-time basis except
when the proposed employment has been approved by the Council of the Village of
Greenfield prior to such employment. If the City Manager desires to employ a
retiree on a full-time basis under this Section, such person or persons must
meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Provide public notice at least sixty (60) days before the
employment is to begin, that the retiree is seeking to draw a pension, and work
for the Village of Greenfield.
      (2)   Hold a public meeting fifteen (15) to thirty (30) days before the
employment is to begin to raise for discussion the issues of the person being
hired in the position.
   Persons hired under this Section shall be considered new hires, and no prior
service with the Village of Greenfield or State of Ohio or any other political
subdivision shall be considered for the calculation of benefits or for
seniority purposes, unless specifically allowed under state or federal statute.
Persons hired under this Section are permitted to be covered under the Village
health insurance, so long as insurance is provided to Employees in other
comparable positions.
   (c)   The City Manager may employ retirees on a part-time basis without the
prior approval of the Council of the Village of Greenfield, so long as such
part-time Employee normally works thirty-two (32) hours or less, and so long as
the part-time Employee only receives allowable statutory benefits (such as
statutory sick leave, allowable pension benefits, etc.). Such part-time
Employees shall not be eligible for other benefits provided by the Village of
Greenfield (such as holiday pay, personal leave, vacation, etc.), and such
part-time Employees shall not be eligible for health insurance under the
Village's plan unless expressly mandated by the plan itself, or state and/or
federal law.
   (d)   The provisions of this chapter are not applicable to elected officials
or to recipients of disability benefits and the treatment of those officials or
Employees will be in accordance with state law.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This
is further detailed in the definition of income (Section

nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by

deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the

compensation plan.

As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during

of this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of

181.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
181.12 (A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits

the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this

liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer

relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the

total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the Village in any month of the preceding calendar
quarter exceeded $200.
Payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the Tax
Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month for which
the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (c)    Intentionally left blank.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Village as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Village during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year,;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

         (a)    "Employer" includes a person that is a related member to or of
an employer.
         (b)    "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in
this state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned
or controlled by an employer.
         (c)    "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
          (d)    "Professional athlete" means an athlete who performs services
in a professional athletic event for wages or other remuneration.

         (g)    "Worksite location" means a construction site or other
temporary worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for
more than 20 days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not
include the home of an employee.
      (2)   (a)    Subject to divisions (C)(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold the Village income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the Village if the employee performed such services in the Village on 20 or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Village.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Village. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
Village at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
                   (a)    The nature of the services are such that it will
require more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
            (iii)    The employee is a resident of the Village and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
181.04. 
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Village than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)    Traveling from any location to another location in order

processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            (iv)    Transporting or delivering property described in division
(C)(2)(b)(iii) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property,
the employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real
estate owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's
employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
       (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to the Village for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the Village.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
Village for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to
the employee for personal services performed in the Village.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the Village and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
181.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the Village.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section 181.04.
         (Ord. 22-15. Passed 10-29-15.)
181.05  ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)   An annual Village income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
181.05 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due the Village.
      (2)    Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for the Village income
tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the Village, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Village, the return or notice required of that individual shall
be completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian,
conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the person or
property of that individual.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

   (E)    The Village shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (F)    (1)   Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual
to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of the
following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2,
"Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's
federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in the case
of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio form
IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation
necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Village to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
    (G) (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to the Village. No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the Village. No remittance is required
if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Village's income tax
return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Village's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's Village income tax return. If
the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the
Village income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a
Village income tax return. The extended due date of the Village income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)    (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Village an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section,
unless the provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the Village income tax ordinance
for a taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)   The person was required to file a return with the Village for
the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed services at
a worksite location (as defined in Section
181.04(C)(1)(g) within the Village.
            (ii)   The person no longer provides services in the Village and
does not expect to be subject to the Village income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the Village. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the Village, make any sales in the Village, or otherwise become subject
to the tax levied by the Village during the taxable year. If the affiant does
become subject to the tax levied by the Village for the taxable year, the
affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer
with the Village income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)(b)
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax return for the
taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that conflicts
with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator form performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the Village by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section 181.04 shall be allowed to the
taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the taxpayer by the
Village, unless the amounts withheld were not remitted to the Village, and the
recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with
the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Village to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
(L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Village, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the
Village or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
Chapter and of the Village's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)    (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the
Village's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the Village
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by the Village during the period of the member's
or civilian's duty service, and for one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter.
The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth (180th)
day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall
provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to
demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)    (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty first (181st) day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division are not
delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)    (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)    (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)   For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
       (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)    (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five (5) year period beginning with the
first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for
each subsequent five (5) year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue
filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five (5) year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five (5) year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (S)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code is
terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code is
binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated the Village income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a
consolidated Village income tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated Village income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless
the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Village income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States department of treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)    (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
181.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section (181.02)(C)(1) to
the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the
adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
181.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
181.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
       (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
181.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
181.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the Village in accordance with this Chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 12-2018. Passed 4-4-18; Ord. 7-2024. Passed 3-4-24.)
 181.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Village who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this Chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due the Village under this Chapter.
   (B)    The Village shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Village who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)    Intentionally left blank.
(Ord. 22-15. Passed 10-29-15; Ord. 7-2024. Passed 3-4-24.)
181.07  ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the Village's income tax for
the current taxable year.
      (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the Village for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld for the Village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Village in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
181.05 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)    (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    For an individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
first month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year,
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
181.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section 181.18 upon
the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless the
underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of this
section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Village under Section
 181.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 26-17. Passed 1-17-18.)
 
181.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document. (Ord. 22-15. Passed 10-29-15.)
181.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
 181.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
           (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
181.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
181.18 (A)(4).
(Ord. 22-15. Passed 10-29-15.)
181.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the Village, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Village as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village is subject to recovery by the Village. If
the Village's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the Village
shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the Village
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (C)    If the Village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Village's tax rate. However, if the Village's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to the Village, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carry forward.   
(Ord. 22-15. Passed 10-29-15.)
181.11 AMENDED RETURNS. 
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal
or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
Village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
181.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
181.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or less, no refund
need be paid by the Village. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
181.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.   
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to the
Village income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Village income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
(Ord. 22-15. Passed 10-29-15.)

            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.

employer, agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to
the extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the
time limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
181.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
                 (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on
which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of
Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after

required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
 181.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
           (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
181.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
181.09. 
   (E)    No civil action to recover the Village income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
          (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 22-15.
Passed 10-29-15.)

      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the Ohio
Revised Code is not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator,
except when the reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to
acknowledge or accept the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the Ohio Revised Code. With the permission of the person affected by an
assessment, the Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the Ohio Revised Code. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new
last known address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and
considered served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after
the assessment's postmark.
                   (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Village official,
or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
           (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by
certified mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address,
the Tax Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The
assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and
include the following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
          (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis
described in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject
to collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 22-15. Passed 10-29-15.)
181.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village that arises pursuant to the Village's income tax imposed in
accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 22-15. Passed 10-29-15.)
 181.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village as
authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 22-15. Passed 10-29-15.)
181.17 FRAUD.
    No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Village ordinance or state law
to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Village or the Tax Administrator.

         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to the Village on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the Village to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (C)    Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

181.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)    Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the Ohio Revised Code:

provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
                  (b)   The powers referred to in this division of this section
shall be exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the
performance of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under
the Village's income tax Chapter;
      (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax

computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
                 (b)    If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax
Review or other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review,
re-determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the
withholding obligations described in Section

Verification of accuracy of returns and determination of liability.

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
      (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the Village or for the withholding of such tax.
             (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person
that the Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any
income that was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction
tending to affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose,
compel any such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such
person's possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
            (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
            (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for
identifying information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid
identifying information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this
Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person
to whom the request was directed pursuant to Section
181.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
 181.99. 
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
 181.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
 181.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
181.99 for a violation of Section
181.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law. (Ord. 22-15. Passed 10-29-15.)

transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (D)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.
   (E)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal. (Ord. 22-15. Passed 10-29-15.)
181.21 BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)    The Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Village, but
such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Village at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the City
Manager of the Village. This member may be an employee of the Village, but may
not be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator
or other similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax
matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review of the Village
shall be two years. There is no limit on the number of terms that a member may
serve if the member is reappointed by the legislative authority. The board
member appointed by the City Manager of the Village shall serve at the
discretion of the administrative official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
      (4)    A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
       (5)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a
public body subject to Section 121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 22-15. Passed 10-29-15.)
 181.22  AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Nothing in this Chapter prohibits the legislative authority of the
Village, or a Tax Administrator pursuant to authority granted to the
administrator by resolution or ordinance, to adopt rules to administer an
income tax imposed by the Village in accordance with this Chapter. Such rules
shall not conflict with or be inconsistent with any provision of this Chapter.
Taxpayers are hereby required to comply not only with the requirements of this

groups of persons, or forms of income specified herein if found to be
unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such unconstitutionality, illegality or
invalidity shall affect only such clause, sentence, section or part of this
Chapter and shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions,

declared to be the intention of Council that this Chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, or part hereof,
not been included therein. (Ord. 22- 15. Passed 10-29-15.)
181.25 COLLECTION OF TAX AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)    This Chapter shall continue effective insofar as the levy of taxes is

effective until all of said taxes levied hereunder in the aforesaid periods are
fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the collection of said
taxes or for the punishment of violations of this Chapter shall have been fully

   (a)   For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of
the Village for use of the General Fund of the Village, and for the further
purpose of providing revenues to promote and publicize the Village, an excise
tax of three percent (3%) is levied on transactions by which lodging by a
hotel/motel or transient accommodations is or is to be furnished to transient
guests, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Section 5739.08(A). The municipal excise
lodging tax upon transient guests shall be in addition to the excise tax
imposed pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Section 5739.09(A) by Highland County.
   (b)   The tax applies and is collectable at the time the lodging is
furnished regardless of the time when the price is paid. The tax does not apply
to lodging furnished to the State, or any of its political subdivisions, or any
charitable organization for the lodging of transient indigent individuals.
   (c)   For the purposes of the proper administration of this chapter and to

is subject to tax until the contrary is established.

   (b)   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest shall
furnish to the vendor, and the vendor shall obtain from the transient guest, a
statement specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no statement is obtained, it shall be presumed the tax applies. (Ord.
6-2024. Passed 3-18-24.)
183.04 REFUND OF ILLEGAL OR ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS.
   The Finance Director shall refund to vendors the amount of taxes paid
illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous assessment where
the vendor has not reimbursed himself from the transient guest. When such
illegal or erroneous payment or assessment was not paid to the vendor but was
paid by the transient guest directly to the Village Finance Director, he shall
refund to the transient guest. Applications shall be filed with the Finance
Director on the form prescribed by him, withing ninety (90) days from the date
it is ascertained that the assessment or payment was illegal or erroneous.
However, in any event such application for refund shall be filed with the
Finance Director within four (4) years from the date of the illegal or
erroneous payment of the tax. On filing of such application, the Finance
Director shall determine the amount of refund due and draw a warrant for such
amount to the person claiming such refund. The Finance Director shall make such
payments from a Tax Refund Fund as established by this chapter and the same is
hereby established.
(Ord. 6-2024. Passed 3-18-24.)
183.05 REQUIRED RECORDS; INSPECTION AND DESTRUCTION.
   Each Vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodgings furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents. If the vendor furnished lodging not subject to the tax, the vendor's
records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale was
exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction if
exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be open
during business hours to the inspection of the Finance Director and shall be
preserved for a period of four (4) years, unless the Finance Director, in
writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or by order requires
that they be kept longer. (Ord. 6-2024. Passed 3-18-24.)
183.06 RETURNS REQUIRED.
   Each vendor shall file a quarterly return on forms prescribed by the Finance
Director showing receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax due from
the vendor to the Village for the period covered by the return, and such other
information as the Finance Director deems necessary for the proper
administration of this chapter. The quarterly return is due on or before the
twentieth day of the month following the end of the quarter. The quarters shall
end on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. The Finance Director
may extend the time for making and filing returns. Returns shall be filed by
mailing the same to the Finance Director, together with payment of the amount
of tax shown to be due thereon. The Finance Director shall stamp or otherwise
mark on all returns the date received by him and shall also show thereon by
stamp or otherwise the amount of payment received with the return. Any vendor
who fails to file a return under this chapter shall, for each day he fails to
do so, forfeit and pay into the City treasury the sum of one percent (1%) of
the amount then owing.
(Ord. 6-2024. Passed 3-18-24.)
183.07 LIABILITY; ASSESSMENT AND PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT; PENALTIES
   (a)    If any vendor collects the tax imposed by this chapter and fails to
remit the same to the Village as prescribed, the vendor shall be personally
responsible for any amount collected which the vendor failed to remit. The
Finance Director may make assessment against such vendor based upon any
information in the Finance Director's possession. If any vendor fails to
collect the tax or any transient guest fails to pay the tax imposed by or
pursuant to this chapter on any transient subject to the tax, such vendor or
transient guest shall be personally liable for the amount of the tax applicable
to the transaction. The Finance Director may make an assessment against either
the vendor or transient guest, as the facts may require, based upon any
information in his possession. An assessment against a vendor in cases where
the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter has not been collected or paid
shall not discharge the transient guest's liability to reimburse the vendor for
the tax applicable to such transaction.
   (b)    Written notice shall be provided to the vendor or transient guest
assessed. Such notice may be served upon the vendor or transient guest assessed
personally or by registered or certified mail. An assessment issued against
either, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, shall not be considered an
election or remedies, nor a bar to an assessment against the other for the tax
applicable to the same transaction, provided that no assessment is issued
against any vendor or transient guest for the tax due on a particular
transaction if tax has actually been paid by another.
   (c)    Unless the vendor or transient guest, to who such notice of
assessment is directed, files within thirty (30) days after service thereof,
either personally or by registered or certified mail, a petition in writing,
verified under oath by such vendor, transient guest or his authorized agent,
having knowledge of the facts, setting forth with particularity the items of
the assessment objected to, together with the reasons for such objections, the
assessment shall become conclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and
payable, from the vendor or transient guest so assessed, to the Finance
Director. When a petition for reassessment is filed, the Finance Director shall
assign a time and place for the hearing of same and shall notify the petition
thereof by registered or certified mail, but the Finance Director may continue
the hearing from time to time in necessary.
   (d)    When any vendor or transient guest files a petition for reassessment
as provided in this chapter, the assessment made by the Finance Director,
together with penalties thereon, shall become due and payable within three (3)
days after notice of the finding made at the hearing has been served, either
personally or by registered or certified mail, upon the party assessed.
   (e)    The Finance Director or designee is authorized to institute civil law
proceedings to collect delinquent taxes due and owing in the municipality by
virtue of the provisions of this Chapter. The Finance Director or designee is
authorized to waive penalties and interest and compromise tax liability and the
right to accept waiver of state statute of limitations.
(Ord. 6-2024. Passed 3-18-24.)
183.08 FOUR YEAR LIMITATION FOR ASSESSMENTS; EXCEPTIONS.
   No assessment shall be made or issued against a vendor or transient guest
for any tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter more than four years after
the return date for the period in which the lodging was furnished, or more than
four years after the return for such period is filed, whichever is later. This
section does not bas an assessment when the Finance Director has substantial
evidence of amounts of taxes collected by a vendor from transient guest's
lodging which were not returned to the Village; or when the vendor assessed
failed to file a return as required. (Ord. 6-2024. Passed 3-18-24.)
183.09 TAX PAID TRANSIENT GUEST; FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX EXEMPT.
   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as required by
this chapter, or present to the vendor false evidence indicating that the
lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax.
(Ord. 6-2024. Passed 3-18-24.)
183.10 VENDOR TO COLLECT TAX; PROHIBITION AGAINST REBATES.
   No vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required by this
chapter. No vendor shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient guest, either
directly or indirectly, any of the tax levied pursuant to this chapter, or make
in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise, any statements which might
imply that his is absorbing the tax, or paying the tax for the transient guest
by an adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at a price including the tax,
or rebating the tax in any other manner.
(Ord. 6-2024. Passed 3-18-24.)
183.11 PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES.
   If any vendor corporation required to file returns and to remit tax due to
the Village under this provision of this chapter fails, for any reason, to make
such filings or payment, any of its officers charged with the responsibility of
filing returns and making payments hall be personally liable for such failure.
The dissolution of a corporation shall not discharge an officer's or employee's
liability for a prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax
due. The sum due for such liability may be collected by assessment in the
manner provided in this chapter. (Ord. 6-2024. Passed 3-18-24.)
183.12 INTENT OF CHAPTER.
   It is the intent of this chapter to levy the excise tax of three percent
(3%) on transactions by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to
transient guests as authorized by Ohio Revised Code Section 5739.08(A).
Accordingly, this chapter shall be construed to effectuate those purposes and
so as to be consistent with any requirement of law compliance with which is a
prerequisite to the validity of the tax intended to be levied hereby.

vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the

residential property" does not include any private property on which is located
one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by
two or more persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in
the structure or structures.
   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to

been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

303.083 IMPOUNDING VEHICLES ON PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer without notification to
the chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However,
when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall
allow the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the
removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief, or
state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the
owner retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or
storage facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69
(B)(3), if applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in addition
to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(ORC 4513.61)
303.09 LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC
4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety

Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC

313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

   (a)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right of way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic control
device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;

subsections. (ORC 4511.19)
   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,
or a combination of them.
            2.   The person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or
urine contains at least the concentration of alcohol specified in subsection
(a)(1)B., C., D. or E. hereof.
            3.   Except as provided in subsection (d)(3) of this section, the
person has a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may
sentence the offender to five consecutive days in jail and not less than
eighteen consecutive days of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of

the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident

restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever

have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. (ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 REIMBURSEMENT OF JAIL COSTS.
   (a)   Any person who is convicted of an offense other than a minor
misdemeanor and is sentenced to confinement in the County Jail shall reimburse
the City of Greenfield for its expenses incurred by reason of the offender’s
confinement, including, but not limited to, the expenses relating to the
provision of food, clothing and shelter. Such reimbursement shall include
expenses for preconviction confinement when credit for such confinement is
credited against the term of imprisonment.
   (b)   The amount of the reimbursement required by this section shall be
determined by the Court after a hearing held pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.15, or
any subsequent amendment thereto. The amount of the reimbursement ordered by
the Court shall not exceed the actual costs of the confinement. The court shall
consider all factors that affect the offender’s financial ability to make
reimbursement to the City. When the Highland County Court makes a reimbursement
determination pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.15, a judgment entry and order of
reimbursement shall be filed and entered that sets forth the total amount of
reimbursement due to the City and the reimbursement schedules and methods.
   (c)   This section shall not apply to offenders that the Court finds to be
indigent.
   (d)   Funds that are reimbursed to the City pursuant to this section shall
be paid into the General Funds of the City treasury.
   (e)   If an offender does not pay to the City the reimbursement ordered by
the Court pursuant to this section, the City Law Director may collect that
claim or institute an appropriate civil action in the name of the City either
in the Highland County Court or Highland County Court of Common Pleas to
recover from the convict the reimbursement for the expenses of confinement as
determined by the Court. If an action is filed it shall be brought not later
than one year after the person is released from incarceration. If it is deemed
in the best interests of the City, the Law Director is authorized to compromise
and settle such claim in an amount less than the total reimbursement due to the
City. If an offender does not comply with the reimbursement determination for
expenses of confinement made by the Court, vexatiously, wantonly, and
obdurately and in any civil action on behalf of the City to recover from the
convict the reimbursement for the expenses of his confinement the Law Director
or his representative shall request an award of attorney fees as part of the
costs of the proceedings. The award of such attorney fees shall be paid into
the General Fund of the City treasury. (Ord. 1-97. Passed 1-8- 97.)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section 
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of                                       Maximum
Misdemeanor                                   Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
(1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in
this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section 
501.11 , either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

505.02 IMPOUNDING AND DISPOSITION; RECORDS.
   (a)   A police officer or animal warden may impound every animal or dog
found in violation of Section

otherwise reasonably determined, notice shall be posted in the pound or animal
shelter both describing the dog and place where seized and advising the unknown
owner that unless the dog is redeemed within three days, it may thereafter be
sold or destroyed according to law. If the dog is wearing a valid registration
tag or the identity of the owner, keeper or harborer is otherwise reasonably
determined, notice shall be given by certified mail to such owner, keeper or
harborer that the dog has been impounded and unless redeemed within fourteen
days of the date of notice, it may thereafter be sold or destroyed according to

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as

   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
 545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
 545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

   (a)    Any person subject to an unlawful housing practice may file within
360 days of the alleged violation with the Board a complaint in writing, sworn
to or affirmed, which shall state: the name and address of the person
aggrieved; the name and address of the person against whom the complaint is
filed; a description and the address of the dwelling, which involves the

   (b)    Upon the filing of the complaint, the Secretary of the Board shall
make such investigations as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues.
Such investigation shall be conducted within fourteen business days after the
filing of the complaint. The investigation may be extended when deemed
necessary by the Chairman of the Human Rights Board. If the Secretary
determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation has
occurred, he shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of initial
conference and persuasion with all interested parties and such representatives
as the parties may choose to assist them. Conciliation conferences shall be
informal and nothing said or done during such initial conferences shall be made
public by any member of the Board or its staff unless the parties agree thereto
in writing.
   (c)    The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced
to writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the
parties, which agreement is for conciliation purposes and does not constitute
an admission by any parties that the law has been violated. Consent agreement
shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its Chairman.
   (d)    The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Commission, Ohio Civil Rights Commission, or the U.S. Department of

further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board shall not
dismiss such complaint without first affording either party an opportunity to
appear before the Board.

of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or an informal consent agreement or determine that a complaint is not
susceptible of conciliation, he shall so notify the Board and the Board shall
thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of this
chapter has been committed. The Board shall serve upon the respondent a written
statement of charges and a summons and shall serve upon all interested parties
a notice of the time and place of the hearing. The respondent or his authorized
counsel may file and amend such statements with the Board prior to the hearing
date as it deems necessary in support of its position. The hearing shall be
open to the public. The hearing shall be held not less than fifteen calendar
days nor more than thirty calendar days after service of the statement of
charges and summons. The summons so issued must be signed by two members of the
Board and the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of named
persons and the production of relevant documents and records. The failure to
comply with a summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The
interested parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or
by a duly authorized representative and may have the assistance of an attorney.
The parties may present testimony in evidence and the right to cross-examine
witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony in evidence shall be given under
oath or by affirmation. The Secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing,
which records shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon
request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such
party a copy of the hearing record, at such cost as the Board deems
appropriate.
   (g)    If, at the conclusion of the hearing the Board determines upon the
preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has violated
this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the City legal counsel,
in executive session, state its finding to and call the legal counsel to
prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person
complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take
such affirmative action as will effectuate the purpose this chapter, with
notice that if the Board upon investigation by the Secretary determines that
the person complained against has not after fifteen calendar days following
service of the Board's order complied with the order, the Board will recertify
the matter to the City legal counsel for enforcement. Such legal counsel shall
seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Human
Rights Board of the City before a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (h)    If, at the conclusion of the hearing the Board determines upon the
preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has not
violated this chapter, the Board shall so state and publish its findings and
issue its order dismissing the complaint. (Ord. 19-81. Passed 7-28-81.)

   (c)   Permit Limitations. Permits granted under this chapter shall be for a
specific wastewater, and such permits shall be granted only after approval of
plans as set forth herein. Subsequent wastewaters of different quantity,
quality or characteristics shall be covered by separate permits.
   (d)   Permit Refusal. The Director may refuse to issue a permit for a new
connection to the sanitary sewer system unless there is available capacity in
all downstream facilities, including treatment plant capacity for BOD5,
suspended solids and phosphorous removal. Capacity shall be determined on the
basis of design criteria previously approved or established by OEPA.
   (e)   Connection Charges. In addition to the permit and inspection fee
specified in subsection (b) hereof, all new users connecting to the City
sanitary sewer system, either inside or outside the City, shall pay the
connection charges as called for in Section
917.07 .
   (f)   Cost of Building Sewer. All costs and expenses incidental to the
installation and connection of the Building Sewer to the public sewer or to an
available service connection shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall
indemnify the City from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the Building Sewer.
   (g)   Building Sewer Limitations. Every building which is the source of the
heretofore described acceptable wastewater shall be provided with a separate
and independent Building Sewer. Where on building stands at the rear of another
on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to
the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the
Building Sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and
the whole considered as one Building Sewer. In the case of industry, several
buildings may be served by one Building Sewer provided the sewer is adequately
sized, and provided it is approved by the Director.
   (h)   Old “Building Sewers”. Old Building Sewers may be used in connection
with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the
Director or his representative, to meet all requirements of this chapter.
   (i)   Combined Sewers. The construction of or extension to combined sewers
is hereby prohibited, unless approved by the OEPA.
   (j)   Private Sanitary Sewers. “Private”, as opposed to “Public”, sanitary
sewers shall continue to be owned by the private owners now owning same until
such time as the owner and the City mutually agree to a transfer of ownership
to the City. Such sewers shall be controlled by the City but shall be operated
and maintained by their owners, unless the City agrees in writing to provide
this service in which case a proper easement shall be dedicated to the City.
   (k)   Design and Construction of Building Sewers. The minimum size and
slope, alignment, and materials of construction of a Building Sewer, and the
methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing, and
backfilling of the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of the
building and plumbing regulations or other rules and regulations of the City or
its designated representative. In the absence of code provisions or in
amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate
specifications of the American Society of Testing Materials and the Water
Pollution Control Federal Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply.
   Whenever possible, the Building Sewer shall be brought to the building at an
elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building
drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, wastewater carried
by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to
the Building Sewer.
   (l)   Illegal Connections. No person shall make connections of roof
downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, driveway drains, or
other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a Building Sewer or Building
Drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary
sewer.
   (m)   Building Sewer Connections. The connection of the Building Sewer into
the public sanitary sewer shall conform to the same requirements as specified
in subsection (k) hereof. All such connections shall be made gastight and
watertight. Any deviations from the prescribed procedures and materials must be
approved by the Director before installation.
   (n)   Inspection. The applicant for the Building Sewer permit shall notify
the Director when the Building Sewer is ready for inspection and connection to
the public sanitary sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision
of the Director or his authorized representative.
   (o)   Safety and Restoration. All excavations for Building Sewer
installations shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to
protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public
property disturbed in the course of construction shall be restored in a manner
satisfactory to the City and in accordance with City standards.
915.06 USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS.
   (a)   Discharge Unpolluted Water Prohibited. No person shall discharge or
cause to be discharged, either directly or indirectly, any storm water, surface
water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling
water, or unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer. Any such
connection shall be subject to immediate removal by the owner of the premises
so connected and at the owner’s expense.
      (1)   Sub-foundation building drains connected to sanitary sewers before
the established date of this Chapter will not be required to be removed unless
it is established by the Director that such connection is detrimental to the
satisfactory operation of the sewage works and that such removal is cost-
effective in accordance with guidelines established by USEPA. Any such
connections made after the effective date of this Chapter shall be prohibited
and shall be removed.
      (2)   Should the owner of such an illegally connected premises fail to
remove the connection within ninety days after the date of official notice to
do so, the Director shall cause the connection to be removed and the cost
thereof shall be billed to the owner of the premises. If such cost is not paid
within sixty days, the City shall certify such cost to the Highland County
Auditor as an assessment upon the property.
   (b)   Permissible Discharge of Unpolluted Water. Storm water and all other
unpolluted drainage, such as from air conditioning, swimming pools, etc., shall
be discharged into such sewers as are specifically designed and designated as
storm sewers or to a combined sewer or a natural outlet approved by the
Director. Industrial uncontaminated cooling water or unpolluted wastewater may
be discharged, on approval of the Director, to a storm sewer, combined sewer,
or natural outlet. If such waters are polluted with insoluble oils or grease or
suspended solids, they shall be treated for removal of the pollutants and the
clear water discharged as specified.
   (c)   Protection of Sanitary and Building Sewers During Construction. No
person constructing a sanitary sewer, building or house connection shall leave
same open, unsealed or incomplete in such fashion as to permit form, surface or
subsurface water to enter such sewers.
   (d)   Obstructions in Sewers. No garbage or obstruction of any kind shall be
placed or thrown in any receiving basin or sewer, and persons so offending
shall be subject to a penalty for each offense.
   (e)   Substances Prohibited. No person shall discharge or cause to be
discharged, either directly or indirectly, any of the following described
waters or wastes to any public sewers:
      (1)   Any gasoline, benzine, naphtha, fuel oil, or other flammable or
explosive liquid, solid, or gas.
      (2)   Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 6.0 or having any other
corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures,
equipment, and personnel of the sewage works.
      (3)   Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable
of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers or other interferences with the
proper operation of the sewage works such as, but not limited to, ashes,
unground bones, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags,
feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure,
hair and fleshings, entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc.,
either whole or ground by garbage grinders.
      (4)   The accidental discharge of any prohibited liquid or solid material
into any public sewer or natural outlet, either directly or indirectly, shall
be reported to the Director immediately by the individual, company, or industry
responsible for the discharge.
   (f)   Substances Limited. The following described substances, materials,
waters or wastes shall be limited in discharge to any public sewer to
concentrations or quantities which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater
treatment process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the
receiving stream, or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property,
or constitute a nuisance. The Director may set limitations lower than the
limitations established herein in the regulations if, in his opinion, more
severe limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. Deliberate
dilution with unpolluted water to meet the concentrations established in the
regulations herein shall not be acceptable. In forming his opinion as to the
acceptability, the Director will give consideration to such factors as the
quantity of subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers,
materials of construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment process
employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, degree of treatability of
the waste in the wastewater plant, and other pertinent factors. The limitations
or restrictions on materials or characteristics of wastes or wastewaters
discharged to the sanitary sewer which shall not be violated without approval
of the Director are as follows:
      (1)   Wastewater having a temperature higher than 150 degrees F (65
degrees C).
      (2)   Wastewater containing more than 100 milligrams per liter of
petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oils, products of mineral oil origin,

may be connected to sanitary sewers from homes, hotels, institutions,
restaurants, hospitals, catering establishments or similar places where garbage
originates from the preparation of food in kitchens for the purpose of
consumption on the premises or when served by caterers. The installation and
operation of any garbage grinder equipped with a motor of three-fourths HP or
greater shall be subject to the review and approval of the Director.
      (5)    Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids
or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other
wastes, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process,
constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a public nuisance, or create
any hazard in the receiving waters of the Wastewater Treatment Plant,
including, but not limited to cyanides, hexavalent chromium, copper, zinc,
cadmium, nickel and phenols in the wastes as discharged to the public sewer.
The following concentrations shall not be exceeded in industrial wastewaters
discharged to any public sewer:
         Total Cyanide (CN), 0. 5 milligrams per liter (mg/1)
         Hexavalent chromium, 1. 0 mg/1

   These maximum concentrations may be changed as necessary by the Director or
state regulatory agencies based on new information concerning inhibitory
substances or to protect treatment plant processes. Industrial dischargers
covered by Federal pretreatment requirements shall meet those limitations
specified under the effluent guidelines published under Sections 307(b) and (c)
of the Federal Act or the above concentrations, whichever is more stringent.
Major contributing industries discharging incompatible pollutants into the
public sewers shall be regulated as provided in subsection (g) herein.
      (6)    Any waters or wastes containing taste or odorproducing substances
exceeding limits which may be established by the Director or any local or State
regulatory agencies.

is required to handle such materials at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.
      (15)    Any water or wastes having excessive discoloration, such as, but
not limited to, dye wastes and spent tanning solutions.
      (16)    Any waters or wastes containing unusual BOD5 , COD, or chlorine
requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the
Wastewater Treatment Plant.
   (g)    Authority for Control of Wastewater Discharges. If any waters or
wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers,
which contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in
subsections (e) and/or (f) hereof, and which in the judgment of the Director
may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater facilities, processes,
equipment or receiving waters, including violation of applicable water quality
standards, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the Director shall:
      (1)    Reject the wastes; or
      (2)    Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers; or
      (3)    Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge, and/
or,
      (4)    Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes under the Extra Strength Surcharge fee which shall be established by
Council.
         A.    All industrial wastewaters discharged to the public sewers by
major contributing industries shall, as a minimum, meet the national
pretreatment standards or best practical control technology currently available
for incompatible pollutants as published in Title 40, Code of Federal
Regulations, Part 128, unless the City is committed, in its NPDES permit, to
remove a specified percentage of the incompatible pollutant. In those instances
the applicable pretreatment standards may be correspondingly reduced to levels
determined by the Director, or his duly authorized representative, or state
regulatory agencies.
         B.   If the Director requires pretreatement or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plans and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the Director and State regulatory agencies and
subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws. No
permit will be granted until such pretreatment facilities have been placed in
operation and have demonstrated their effectiveness by test. The cost of such
testing, sampling, and analyzing shall be borne by the wastewater contributor.
         C.   The approval of proposed pretreatment facilities by the Director
does not guarantee that these facilities or equipment will function in the
manner described by their manufacturer; nor shall it relieve a person, firm or
corporation of the responsibility of enlarging or otherwise modifying such
facilities to accomplish the intended purpose.
   (h)   Grease and Oil Interceptors. Fat, grease, oil and inorganic material
such as sand, grit, etc., interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion
of the Director, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing flotable grease in excessive amounts, as specified in subsection (f)
(2) hereof, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except
that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or
dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by
the Director, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these interceptors the owner
shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means
of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates, and means of
disposal which are subject to review by the Director. Any removal and hauling
of the collected materials not performed by the owner’s personnel must be
performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms.
   (i)   Operation of Pretreatment Facilities. Where pretreatment or flow-
equalizing facilities are provided or required for any waters or wastes, they
shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the
owner at his expense, and shall be subject to periodic inspection by the
Director. The owner shall maintain operating records, and shall submit to the
Director a quarterly summary report of the character of the influent and
effluent to show the performance of the treatment facilities.
   (j)   Analyses. All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics
of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods” or “EPA
Methods”. Reference is made to EPA “Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for
Analysis of Pollutants” (40 CFR 136). Sampling methods, location, times,
durations, and frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject
to approval by the Director.
   (k)   Special Conditions. No statement contained in this section shall be
construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City
and any industrial concern whereby an industrial wastewater of unusual strength
or character may be accepted by the City for treatment, subject to possible
payment therefor by the industrial concern for subsequent treatment. Any
industrial concern may appeal any determination made by the Director in the
enforcement of this chapter. Upon approval of Council, the Director may enter
into a contract with an industry which contains terms that vary from the
charges and regulations established in existing ordinances.
915.07 CONTROL OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS.
   (a)    Submission of Basic Data. Within sixty days after passage of this
chapter, each person whose operation entails the discharge of industrial
wastewater to a public sewer shall prepare and file with the City a written
statement setting forth the nature of the operation contemplated or presently
carried on, the amount and source of water required for use, the proposed point
of discharge of such wastewater into the wastewater collection system of the
City, the estimated amount to be so discharged and a fair statement setting
forth the expected bacterial, physical, chemical and other known
characteristics of such wastewater. Within a reasonable time of receipt of such
statement, it shall be the duty of the City to make an order stating such
minimum restrictions as in the judgment of the Director may be necessary to
adequately guard against unlawful uses of the City’s wastewater system. If such
a statement has been previously filed with the City to the satisfaction of the
Director, the requirements of this section will be waived.
   (b)    Extension of Time. When it can be demonstrated that circumstances
exist which would create an unreasonable burden on the person to comply with
the time schedule imposed by subsection (a) hereof, a request for extension of
time may be presented for the consideration of the Director. All requests for
extension of time shall be submitted in writing stating the reasons for such a
request. Under no circumstances shall the extension of time exceed thirty days
after approval of the extension by the Director.
   (c)    Control Manholes.
      (1)    Each person discharging industrial wastewater into a public sewer
shall construct and maintain one or more control manholes or access points to
facilitate observation, measurement and sampling of his wastewater, including
sanitary wastewater.
      (2)    Control manholes or access facilities shall be located and built
in a manner acceptable to the Director. If measuring devices are to be
permanently installed they shall be of a type acceptable to the Director.
      (3)    Control manholes, access facilities, and related equipment shall
be installed by the person discharging the wastewater at his expense, and shall
be maintained by him so as to be in safe condition, accessible and in proper
operating condition at all times. Plans for the installation of such facilities
shall be approved by the Director prior to the beginning of construction.
      (4)    In the event no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole may be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public
sewer to the point at which the Building Sewer is connected.
   (d)    Wastewater Volume Determination.
      (1)    The volume of flow used for computing industrial wastewater
charges shall be the metered water consumption of the industrial user as shown
in the records of water meter readings maintained by the City, except as herein
provided.
      (2)    If the person discharging industrial wastewater into the public
sewers procures any part, or all, of this water from sources other than the
City water system, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewers,
the person shall install and maintain at his expense water meters of a type
approved by the Director for the purpose of determining the volume of water
obtained from those other sources.
      (3)    The person discharging industrial wastewater into the public
sewers may install and maintain at his expense metering devices for determining
the volume of wastewater being discharged to the public sewer, from which the
industrial wastewater charges would be computed. The measuring devices shall be
of a type acceptable to the Director.
      (4)    The Director may require the installation of devices for measuring
the volume of wastewater discharged if these volumes cannot otherwise be
determined from the metered water consumption records.
      (5)    Any metering device for determining the volume of wastewater
discharged to the public sewer shall be installed, owned and maintained by the
industrial user. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be
removed without the consent of the Director.
   (e)    Sampling and Monitoring.
      (1)    Industrial wastewaters discharged into the public sewers shall be
subject to periodic inspection with a determination of character and
concentration of such wastes. The determination shall be made as often as may
be deemed necessary by the Director but in no case less than one twenty-four
hour composite sample per quarter. The owner shall be responsible for the
collection and testing of the aforementioned samples.
      (2)    Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be
representative of the composition of the wastewater. The sampling shall be
accomplished by the use of automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting
composite samples, or by other approved means.
      (3)    Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the Director or
his authorized representative at all times. Care shall be exercised in the
collection of samples to insure their preservation in a state comparable to
that at the time the sample was taken.
   (f)    Analysis.
      (1)    Laboratory procedure used in the examination of industrial
wastewaters shall be those set forth in the latest edition of "Standard
Methods" or "EPA Methods". However, alternative methods for certain analyses of
industrial wastewaters may be used subject to mutual agreement between the
Director and the industrial user. Reference is made to EPA "Guidelines
Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants" (40 CFR 136).
      (2)    Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial
wastewaters shall be made by the industrial user responsible for the discharge,
or the industrial user's qualified agent as approved by the Director. The
results of the analyses shall be reported to the City on a quarterly basis on
forms provided by the City. The City may make its own analyses on the
wastewaters and these determinations, when made, shall be binding as a basis
for charges, except under circumstances in the subsection (f)(3) hereof.
      (3)    In case the analyses performed by the industry and the City result
in substantially different values, an effort shall be made by the industry to
collect samples at the same time the City collects its own samples. The results
of the analyses on the samples collected by the City and the industry shall be
compared using the same testing procedures as outlined in the latest edition of
"Standard Methods" and the differences negotiated.
915.08 POWERS AND AUTHORITY OF INSPECTORS.
   (a)    The Director, and other duly authorized employees of the City bearing
proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to enter upon all
properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling,

917.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)    The purpose of this chapter is:
      (1)    To establish User Charges and Industrial Cost Recovery Charges
which will meet the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as
published in the Federal Register, August 21, 1973, Volume 38, Number 161;
which will generate sufficient revenue to meet all operation, maintenance, and
equipment replacement costs; and which will recover from the industrial users
of the treatment works the amount of the Federal grant allocable to the
treatment of wastes from such users;
      (2)    To establish charges which will generate sufficient revenues to
meet all existing debts service requirements;
      (3)    To establish Extra Strength Surcharges for wastewaters exceeding
the strength of "Normal Strength" Wastewater, as defined herein, and including
an Industrial Waste Surveillance Charge to cover the cost of monitoring all
industrial wastewaters discharged to the sanitary sewer system; and
      (4)    To establish Connection Charges for all new users in the service
area connecting to the Greenfield sanitary sewer system.
   (b)    Every person, firm or corporation whose premises are served by a
connection to the sanitary sewer system, which connection discharges sanitary
wastewater, industrial wastewater, cooling water or other liquids, either
directly or indirectly, into the sewage works facilities under the jurisdiction
of the City, will be charged for the use of such facilities. The sewer service
charges shall be applied to each and every premises discharging to the sanitary
sewer system, and the charges shall be as specified in this chapter.
917.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless the context specifically indicates otherwise, the meaning of terms
used in this chapter shall be as follows:
   (a)    "Operation and Maintenance Costs" means all costs associated with the
operation and maintenance of the wastewater collection and treatment
facilities, including salaries and wages, electric power, propane gas and fuel
oil, chemicals, miscellaneous supplies and equipment, maintenance of equipment
and facilities, employee fringe benefits, other necessary expenses and all
costs associated with equipment replacement.
   (b)    "Equipment Replacement Costs" means expenditures made for obtaining
and installing equipment, accessories or appurtenances which are necessary
during the service life of the treatment works to maintain the capacity and
performance for which such works were designed and constructed (Reference 40
CFR 35.905-17).
   (c)    "Normal Strength Wastewater" as defined for the purpose of
determining surcharges means wastewater having an average daily suspended
solids concentration of not more than 250 mg/1, an average daily BOD5 of not
more than 200 mg/1, an average daily total phosphorous concentration of not
more than 10 mg/1, and containing not more than 100 mg/1 of Freon soluble
matter (grease and oil).
917.03 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)    The Sewer Service Charges shall consist of a User Charge, Industrial
Cost Recovery Charges, where applicable, a Debt Service Charge, Extra Strength
Surcharges, where applicable, and Connection Charges. The User Charge is
payment to the City by all recipients of sewer service for treatment of "Normal
Strength" Wastewater or wastewater of less than "Normal Strength". It is
designed to offset the cost of operation and maintenance of the collection and
treatment facilities, including cost associated with equipment replacement. The
User Charge is intended to enable the Sewer Rental Fund to be financially self-
sufficient with respect to operation and maintenance of the sewerage system.
   (b)    For wastewaters which exceed “Normal Strength" the user shall pay
Extra Strength Surcharges, as specified herein under Section
917.06, in addition to the other Sewer Service Charges specified in this
chapter for "Normal Strength" Wastewater.
   (c)    The Industrial Cost Recovery Charges (ICR Charges) shall be used to
determine payments to the City from Industrial Class Users, as defined herein,
for use of the sewage works facilities, to recover the amount of the Federal
grant awarded under P. L. 92-500 allocable to the treatment of industrial
wastewaters and/or cooling water discharged by such users to the sanitary sewer
system.
   (d)    The Debt Service Charge is payment to the City by all recipients of
service, and is designed to cover all debt service requirements incurred as a
result of constructing required capital improvements.

   (d)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Public Service Director
from establishing rates for bulk deliveries pursuant to Ordinance 41-89.
(Ord. 01-09. Passed 1-20-09; Ord. 19-13. Passed 12-4-13; Ord. 19-2022. Passed
1-9-23.)
   (e)   The ICR Charges shall be paid in addition to the User Charge by each
Industrial Class User in the Service Area discharging industrial wastewater to
any component or components of the sewage works facilities from which the user
is receiving benefits and for which an EPA Grant has been awarded. However, any
industry discharging less than the equivalent of 25,000 gpd of sanitary
wastewater shall be exempt from the Industrial Cost Recovery System provided
such discharge does not contain pollutants which:
      (1)   Interfere with the treatment works processes.
      (2)   Are toxic or incompatible.
      (3)   Contaminate or otherwise reduce the utility value of treatment
works sludge.
   Industrial wastewater shall include cooling water where such is discharged
to the sanitary sewer.
   (f)   ICR payments shall be based on the flow of industrial wastewater and
cooling water only discharged to the sanitary sewer system, as hereinafter
determined, and are not to be paid on any sanitary wastewater discharged by an
Industrial Class User. All ICR charges shall be as provided by Council and
shall be calculated on the basis of a thirty year recovery period.
   (g)   Each industry discharging to the sanitary sewer system shall complete
and file with the City an Industrial Waste Questionnaire containing pertinent
information as to quantity of flow, characteristics of discharged wastewaters,
etc., and this information will be used to determine billings for the first
year following the effective date of this chapter. Subsequent billings will be
based on revised information taken from annual updated reports to be filed with
the City, or from other records. Interim reports may be requested at the
discretion of the Director. New industries shall file a fully executed
questionnaire with the City prior to being issued a Sewer Permit.
   (h)   Where industrial wastewater is combined with sanitary wastewater at
the point or points of discharge, and no separate metering of each increment is
provided, the sanitary wastewater from industry shall be considered equal to
fifteen gallons per day per employee (thirty gallons per day where showers are
used) at “Normal Strength” loadings as previously defined herein.
   (i)   The Service Charges shall be computed on the basis of water purchased
from the City, as registered by the water meter or meters, unless the actual
quantity of wastewater entering the sanitary sewer system can be determined, as
specified hereinafter.
   (j)   Each premises served by the sanitary sewer system of the City shall be
charged, and where a premises is served by more than one sewer connection a
combined charge shall be levied based on the total flow from all connections.
However, where the property is not occupied, a minimum charge shall be levied
for each sewer connection.
   (k)   Where more than one meter is installed, whether for the convenience of
the owner of the premises or the City, Service Charges shall be rendered to the
owner of the premises for each meter, unless the combined flow through all
meters is authorized by the Director.
   (l)   When a person, firm or corporation can show to the satisfaction of the
Director that a portion of the water as measured by the water meter does not
enter the sanitary sewer system, such as uncontaminated cooling water, such
person, firm or corporation may submit an application in writing to the
Director for the installation of an auxiliary water meter. The Director has the
authority to permit or to require an additional meter to be installed at the
applicant’s expense, so as to measure the quantity of water actually entering
the sanitary sewer system. The quantity of water used to determine the Service
Charges shall be the quantity of water actually entering the sanitary sewer
system as so determined.
   (m)   If the Director finds that it is not practicable to measure such water
by meters, he shall determine the volume of wastewater in any manner or method
as he may find practicable, in order to arrive at the percentage of metered
water entering the sanitary sewer system and the quantity of water used to
determine the Sewer Service Charges shall be that percentage so determined.
   (n)    In the event that the conditions set forth in subsection (k) hereof
are not, for any reason, met, all water metered to the premises shall be used
for billing purposes.
   (o)   When a premises is supplied either whole or in part with water from a
well or any source other than a public water supply, such well or source of
supply shall be registered in writing with the Director. The owner of the
premises shall install and maintain at his expense, a meter or meters
acceptable to the Director on all such supplies, and the quantity of water used
to determine the service charges shall be the quantity as measured by the meter
or meters. If the meter or meters are not installed within six months from the
date of notification in writing by the Director, the owner or other users of
the premises shall be billed at double the minimum charge.
   (p)   Where an auxiliary meter, or meters, is required for the proper
determination of water subject to the Service Charges, such meter shall be
installed only after approval has been granted by the Director. Such meter
shall be installed, owned and maintained by the property owner. Venturi meters,
flumes, weirs and other methods of measuring flow shall be used only when
authorized by the Director. Meters which will be approved are as follows:
      (1)   Meters purchased from the City.
      (2)   Meters equal or similar to meters purchased from the City which are
purchased elsewhere and tested by the City.
      (3)   Crest or turbine type meters of two inch size and over, to be used
where it is established the particular meter is under full head at all times;
provided such meters are tested and approved for large constant flows by the
City.
      (4)   Existing private meters now in place, may be continued in use on a
conditional basis. If such meters are suspected of faulty registration, they
are subject to a test, when so ordered by the Director.
      (5)   Other meters shall be tested by the manufacturer of the meter and a
certificate of the test shall be furnished to the Director. Such meters shall
not be used without the written approval of the Director.
      (6)   It is understood that where an auxiliary meter has been installed,
such a meter shall not be removed without the approval of the Director.
   (q)   All meters shall be installed in accordance with the standards, rules
and regulations of the City.
   Where private meters are used on well, or in an industrial water
distribution system, and such meters are set behind the primary water supply
meter, the aforementioned standards, rules and regulations may be modified or
waived by the Director.
   (r)   Fire protection service branches shall be exempt from all Service
Charges except for water used for purposes other than fire protection.
   (s)   Where a sanitary or combined sewer in the area served by the City is
available to any lot, parcel of land, building, or premises which is improved,
it is a conclusive presumption that wastewater from such lot, parcel of land,
building, or premises which is improved is discharged into such sewer, and the
owner shall be billed the Service Charges as provided herein. Any lot, parcel
of land, building, or premises abutting a street, alley or easement in which
there is a public sanitary or combined sewer shall be deemed to have available
access to a sanitary sewer, and the owner or other users of such real property
shall connect to the sewer within six months from the date the owner is
notified in writing by the City that the sewer is made available for use to
their property. In the event the owner or other users of the real property are
not connected on such date, the minimum charge specified under subsection (b)
hereof shall be imposed upon the property. Reference is made to Section
915.03(d). (Ord. 05-06. Passed 6-21- 06.)
917.06 EXTRA STRENGTH SURCHARGES.
   (a)   Surcharges shall be determined on the basis of the following
constituents of the wastewater that are in excess of “Normal Strength”
Wastewater:
      (1)   Total suspended solids (nonfilterable residue);
      (2)   BOD, 5-days at 20° C.
      (3)   Total phosphorous (P).
   (b)   When any or all of the total suspended solids or BOD or phosphorous of
a wastewater accepted for admission to the City’s sanitary sewer system exceeds
the values of the above specified constituents for “Normal Strength”
Wastewater, the amount of the treatment surcharge to be paid will be based on
the cost per pound of removing the excess quantity of each constituent.
   (c)   Extra Strength Surcharges are hereby established as follows:
 
   (1)   Suspended solids                $0.07 per lb.
   (2)   5 day Biochemical Oxygen    0.09 per lb.
   (3)   Total phosphorous (P)           0.34 per lb.
 
   (d)   An Industrial Wastewater Surveillance Charge is hereby established of
two hundred dollars ($200.00) per year for each connection discharging
industrial wastewaters to the sanitary sewer system. Where it has been reported
that no industrial wastewaters are being discharged, a fifty dollars ($50.00)
charge shall be levied only once per year to cover the cost of verifying such
report. The moneys collected from this charge shall be used to cover the cost
of making surveys, record keeping and occasional analytical work necessary for
verification of owner reported results.
917.07 CONNECTION CHARGES.
   (a)   In addition to the Permit and Inspection Fee specified in Section
915.05(b), all new users connecting to the Municipal sanitary sewer system
shall pay a Universal Connection Charge. It is a charge for acquiring equity in
the City’s existing Sewerage System. These charges are one- time charges and
may be paid at the same time an application is submitted for a sewer permit or,
at the option of the residential property owner only, may be paid over a period
of twelve months by equal monthly installments or other arrangements entered
into in writing and satisfactory to the Director of the Water and Sewer
Department.

(Ord. 19-97. Passed 9-3-97.)
   (c)   In the event of future sewerage improvements, which are financed
either all or in part with City funds, a Reimbursement Connection Charge will
be established by the City for each such improvement.
   (d)    An applicant whose premises is not supplied with water by the City,
but who wishes to use the sanitary sewer services supplied by the City, shall
pay the connection charges listed in subsection (b) hereof based on the
estimated maximum rate of flow and in accordance with the following schedule:

   (f)    Any applicant whose property does not abut an existing sanitary sewer
facility shall, at his own expense, construct such trunk and/or lateral
facility as may be directed by the City. Upon completion of the facility to the
satisfaction of the City, such facility shall become the property of the City
and be subject to all rules and regulations applicable.
   (g)    In any area where no sanitary sewer facilities of any kind exist, an
applicant may contract with the City, for the construction of such facilities.
917.08 BILLING AND PAYMENT.
   (a)    All service charges except Industrial Cost Recovery Charges and
Connection Charges shall be billed and payed in accordance with the regulations
established by Council.
   (b)    In accordance with P. L. 95-217, EPA has declared a moratorium on the
payment of all Industrial Cost Recovery Charges between December 28, 1977 and
June 30, 1979. After the moratorium, such deferred payment shall be made in
accordance with the applicable ICR requirement at that time. The payment, if
required, shall be made in equal annual installments prorated over the
remaining useful life of the facility, but not exceeding thirty years. Billings
for all ICR Charges shall be made on an annual basis, and payments shall be due
within thirty days after the billing date. Payments may be made at the
Industrial Users option in twelve equal monthly installments. Failure to pay
the ICR Charges within the due date shall be cause for sewer service to be
discontinued.
917.09 ADMINISTRATION AND PROCEDURES.
   (a)    The funds received from the collection of sewer service charges shall
be deposited with the Treasurer of the City. The money so deposited shall be
kept by the Treasurer in the Sewer Consumer Fund. Collections resulting from
the User Charges, Debt Service Charges, and Extra Strength Surcharges shall be
kept in the Sewer Rental Fund. The Industrial Cost Recovery Payments when
collected shall be kept in the Industrial Cost Recovery Fund. Moneys collected
from the Connection Charges shall be kept in the Sewer Plant and Trunk
Expansion Fund.
   (b)    The Sewer Rental Fund shall be used for the payment of the cost of
management, maintenance, operation and repair of the sanitary sewer system and
wastewater treatment plants, including all costs associated with equipment
replacement, and for the debt service required for improvements to the sewerage
system by the construction of sanitary sewers and wastewater treatment plants,
and the acquisition of necessary land therefor and for sinking fund purposes
for the retirement of such debt.
   (c)    The Industrial Cost Recovery Fund shall be administered and disbursed
in accordance with United States Environmental Protection Agency Guidelines (40
CFR 35. 928-2).
      (1)    The Treasurer shall retain fifty percent (50%) of the amounts
recovered from the Industrial Cost Recovery Payments. The remainder, together
with any interest charged thereon, shall be returned to the United States
Treasury on an annual basis.
      (2)    A minimum of eighty percent (80%) of the retained amounts,
together with the interest thereon, shall be used solely for eligible costs, in
accordance with Paragraph 35.940 of the Construction Grants Regulations, of
expanding, improving or reconstructing the sewerage works associated with the
project and necessary to meet the requirements of the City's discharge permit.
The Treasurer shall obtain the approval of the Regional Administrator of the
United States Environmental Protection Agency prior to commitment of the
retained amounts for any expansion, improvement or reconstruction. The
remaining twenty percent (20%) of the retained amounts, together with the
interest thereon, shall be transferred to the Equipment Replacement Account of
the Sewer Rental Fund.
      (3)    Pending use, the Treasurer shall invest the retained amounts for
reconstruction and expansion in:
         A.    Obligations of the United States Government; or
         B.    Obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the
United States Government or any agency thereof; or
         C.    Shall deposit such amounts in accounts fully collateralized by
obligations of the United States Government or by obligations fully guaranteed
as to principal and interest by the United States Government or any agency
thereof.
   (d)    On or before July 1 of 1980, and each year thereafter on or before
July 1, the Treasurer shall submit to the Mayor a recommended system of User
Charges, Debt Service Charges, Extra Strength Surcharges, Industrial Cost
Recovery Charges, and Connection Charges. The Mayor shall submit the schedule
of charges with his recommendations to Council at their first regular meeting
in October, for ratification. The system shall be in accordance with the
following requirements:
      (1)    The system shall result in the distribution of the costs of
operation and maintenance of the sewerage works within the Director's
jurisdiction to each user class in proportion to such user's contribution to
the total wastewater loading of the treatment works. Factors such as strength,
volume and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included
as the basis for the user's contribution to insure a proportional distribution
of operation and maintenance, including replacement, costs to each user class.
      (2)    The system shall be reviewed annually and revised periodically to
reflect actual operation, maintenance and replacement costs of the sewerage
works.
      (3)    The system shall generate sufficient revenue to offset the costs
of all sewerage works operation and maintenance provided by the Director and
such other expenditures authorized by subsection (b) hereof.
      (4)    The system shall recover that portion of the Federal grant(s)
awarded under P. L. 92-500 allocated to the treatment of industrial
wastewaters.
      (5)    The cost of treating and handling the extra constituents of BOD5,
suspended solids and phosphorous shall be determined and reported in the
Schedule of Extra Strength Surcharges at a cost per pound for each constituent.
      (6)    In order to establish the Industrial Waste Surveillance Charge,
the cost shall be determined by calculating the actual cost of gathering
samples, testing, and reporting the results of analysis, and distributing the
cost proportionately to the appropriate users.
   
   (e)    Funds received from the Industrial Wastewater Surveillance Charge
shall be deposited in the Sewer Rental Fund.
   (f)    In connection with the administering of this chapter reference is
made to Section
915.07, specifically those subsections pertaining to Control Manholes,
Wastewater Volume Determination, Sampling and Monitoring, and Analyses.
   (g)    The results of routine sampling and analysis by the owner will be
used to determine the Extra Strength Surcharges. However, the Director may, at
any period or time and of such duration and in such manner as the Director may
elect, determine the strength of the discharge wastewater for purposes of
verification. If the owner fails to file the necessary annual reports, the
strength determined by the Director's analysis will be used to determine the
amount of the surcharges. Similarly the surcharges shall be applied to the
total metered water consumption if the owner fails to file the required annual
report.
   (h)    If necessary, the Director shall have the right to enter and set up,
on company property, such devices as are necessary to conduct a gauging and
sampling operation and to begin such operation without advance notice to the
company or owner. While performing the work, the Director or his
representatives will observe all safety rules applicable to the premises,
established by the company.
   (i)    Where a company has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry onto the company's premises is
granted, such company shall either make necessary arrangements with their
security guards that upon showing proper identification the Director or his
representatives will be permitted to enter, without delays, for the purpose of
obtaining samples, grab or composite, of wastes being discharged at the various
sampling points; or the company shall install suitable gauging and sampling
manholes outside the security limits, which manholes will at all times be
immediately accessible to the Director or his representatives.
   (j)    If a person, firm or corporation disagrees with the analysis on which
the surcharges are based, he may request, in writing, an additional sampling
and analysis which shall be conducted in a manner acceptable to the Director.
The requestor shall be billed for twenty-five percent (25%) of an additional
Surveillance Charge in order to cover the cost of such additional sampling and
analysis.
917.10 REJECTION OR PRETREATMENT.
   (a)    In cases where the character of wastewater from any manufacturing
plant, building or premises is such that it will damage the sanitary sewerage
system or cannot be treated satisfactorily in the sewerage system, the Director
has, and shall use, his authority to compel such users to dispose of such
wastewater otherwise and prevent it from entering the system.
   (b)    In cases where the character of the wastewater from any manufacturing
or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it imposes an
unreasonable burden upon such sanitary sewerage system greater than that
imposed by the normal wastewater entering the sewerage system, the Director
may, if he deems advisable, compel such manufacturing or industrial plant,
building or premises to pretreat such wastewater in such manner as he shall
specify before discharging such wastewater into the sewerage system.
917.11 SPECIAL AGREEMENTS.
   No statement contained herein shall be construed as preventing any special
agreement or arrangement between the City and any industrial concern whereby an
industrial wastewater of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the
City for treatment subject to payment thereto by the industrial concern. Any
contract with an industry shall be governed by all charges and regulations as
established in the City's ordinances.
917.12 SEVERABILITY.
   The invalidity of any section, clause, sentence or provision of this Chapter
shall not affect the validity of any other part of this Chapter which can be
given effect without such invalid part or parts.

cemetery lot or any portion of a cemetery lot only to:
      (1)   Another member of the cemetery lot owner’s immediate family (i.e.,
a person’s parents, step-parents, siblings, spouse, children, step-children,
and adopted children). Such inter-family transfers are valid and permitted only

Greenfield Municipal Cemetery, except as may be required by law, health, or in
special cases as authorized by the City Manager.
   (g)    Grave surfaces shall be kept level with the surrounding terrain since
it is difficult to mow or to make grass grow upon a mound. A smooth sward is
more pleasing and mounds are no longer necessary to mark grave sites, as an
exact record of their location is kept by the cemetery.
   (h)    Subject to the approval of the City Manager or his/her designee, the
planting of shrubs and flowers will be permitted on cemetery lots, provided
however, that no planting of any kind will be permitted on graves. Any planting

its roots, branch, or otherwise, become detrimental, dangerous, or inconvenient
to adjacent cemetery lots or walks, or if it becomes unsightly, the City
Manager or his/her designee shall have the right, and it shall be his duty to
remove such tree or shrub, or any portion thereof, as he shall judge best. The
cemetery will replant grass which must be removed to make interments.
   (k)    No turf may be removed for flower bed or other purpose without first
obtaining the City Manager or his/her designee's permission.
   (l)    The cemetery will maintain, as nearly as may be practical, the
planting of trees and shrubs that are contained in the landscaping and general
background of the cemetery.
   (m)    No fence, hedge, enclosure, or curbing of any kind will be allowed on
cemetery lots.
   (n)    Glassware, cans, crockery, boxes, baskets, shells or watering pots
left on graves or cemetery lots are detrimental to the appearance of the
cemetery, and the City Manager or his/her designee is directed to remove such
articles from the graves and cemetery lots.
   (o)    No person shall deposit anywhere within cemetery limits, debris,
rubbish or waste material of any nature except that resulting from decoration
or care of cemetery lots. Such debris and waste material shall be deposited at
places or in receptacles designated for such use.
   (p)    Orders for special work in anticipation of Memorial Day must be filed
with the City Manager or his/her designee not later than May 1.
   (q)    Persons wishing to make improvements of any kind on their own or
other cemetery lots must first consult the City Manager or his/her designee.
   (r)    The City will use reasonable care in engaging competent and
experienced cemetery employees, and in seeing that they do their work with
customary carefulness, but it disclaims any responsibility or liability for
accident or damage to headstones, vases, monuments or mausoleums resulting from
the ordinary hazards of cemetery work. Nor does it assume any liability for
accident or damage to person or property due to defects of machinery,
implements, tools or equipment used in cemetery work.
   (s)    Metal emblems may be placed on graves when permitted by the City
Manager or his/her designee. Such emblem shall be removed when deemed advisable
by the City Manager or his/her designee.
   (t)   Undertakers and others, entering and while within the cemetery, will
be under the control and subject to the direction of the City Manager or his/
her designee.
   (u)    Cemetery lots sold will include a regular endowment feature to insure
future care at the rate of fifty dollars ($50.00) per grave space. Said funds
will be applied to Cemetery Capital Improvement Funds and will be subject to
restrictions of that fund. Income only from the amount so paid will be used for
care of grave spaces.
(Ord. 08-10. Passed 7-20-10.)
941.02 REGULATION OF CONDUCT.
   (a)    Children may be excluded from the cemetery at any time unless
accompanied by an adult, who will be responsible for their conduct.
   (b)    Visitors are prohibited from plucking any plants, whether cultivated

fourth degree, and a mandatory fine of two hundred dollars ($200.00) shall be
imposed.

military funerals or Memorial Day exercises.

his/her designee.
   (i)    All persons are reminded that the grounds are sacredly devoted to the
burial of the dead, and that the provisions and penalties of the law will be

removed without further notice.

flowers will be removed when cemetery lots are mowed.

that such land or structure may be used or occupied in a manner or for a use
prohibited by this Section.
(Ord. 32-2020. Passed 1-19-21.)
1103.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Tier System.
      (1)   The Village of Greenfield finds that its rural, sub- urban, and
urban areas have substantially different physical, geographic, and functional
characteristics that require alternative regulatory treatment. Rural areas are
largely undeveloped and are characterized by woodlands, agricultural lands,
horse farms, and scattered residential and commercial uses at very low
densities. Suburban areas are automobile oriented, with auto-medium densities,
front-loaded garages, and separate commercial areas. Residents of suburban
neighborhoods desire a living environment that favors the values of security
and privacy. Urban neighborhoods are more compact and pedestrian friendly,
reflecting traditional community character and architecture. Residents of urban
neighborhoods prefer a strong sense of community and a mixed-use living
environment.
      (2)   A rural tier, a suburban tier, and a traditional tier are
established by this section in order to provide a framework for assigning land-
use categories, zoning districts, and development standards. The tiers are
shown on the official zoning map.
Table 1103-1   Tier and Zoning Ordinance Correspondence
Zoning District                Tier
“RE” (Residential Estate)  Rural or suburban
“NS” (Neighborhood SuburbanSuburban
“NU” (Neighborhood Urban)  Traditional
“CN” (Commercial NeighborhoTraditional or suburban
“CG” (Commercial General)  Traditional or suburban
“D” (Downtown)             Traditional
“IL” (Industrial Light)    Suburban
“IH” (Industrial Heavy)    Traditional or suburban
   (b)   Base Zoning District. The Village of Greenfield is divided into the
zoning districts shown in Table 1103-1.
   (c)   Zoning Districts (Additional). Additional zoning districts may be
added from time to time upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission to
the Village of Greenfield Council pursuant to Code Amendments in Chapter
1107, Administration and Procedures, of the Planning and Zoning Code. (Ord. 32-
2020. Passed 1-19-21.)
1103.05 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   The maps delineating the boundaries of the various zoning districts,
together with all matters and things shown on such maps, are adopted and
approved, and collectively constitute the "official zoning map." The official
zoning map is incorporated by reference and made a part of the zoning code.
These maps are on file in the office of the Building and Zoning Inspector and
in the office of the Clerk or Recorder of the Village of Greenfield. All
amendments to the official zoning map shall be listed in the order adopted in a
separate register maintained in and kept current by the Building and Zoning
Inspector. The official zoning map carries the zoning district designations
established in this Chapter.
(Ord. 2-2024. Passed 2-5-24.)
1103.07 ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   (a)   When definite distances in feet are not shown on the zoning map, the
following rules apply:
      (1)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the right-of-way or
centerlines of streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such
right-of-way or centerlines;
      (2)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following such lot lines;
      (3)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following Village of
Greenfield limits shall be construed as following Village of Greenfield limits;
      (4)   Whenever any street, alley, or other public way not subject to
zoning regulations is vacated by official action of the Village of Greenfield,
or whenever such area is franchised for building purposes, the zoning district
line adjoining each side of such street, alley, or other public way shall be
automatically extended to the center of such vacation, and all areas so
involved shall then be subject to all regulations of the extended districts;
and
      (5)   Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground vary
from those shown on the official zoning maps, or in other circumstances where
the zoning boundary is unclear, the Building and Zoning Inspector shall
interpret the district boundaries with appeal to the board of adjustment.
         (Ord. 32-2020. Passed 1-19-21.)
1103.09 BASE ZONING DISTRICTS - GENERALLY.
   No development approval shall be issued unless the proposed development
conforms to the design regulations prescribed within the applicable zoning
district. Rules for interpreting the design regulations are included in the lot
layout, height, and density/intensity standards.
(Ord. 32-2020. Passed 1-19-21.)
1103.11 USE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Generally. No use is permitted unless it is listed as a permitted or
conditional use in this section. Those uses permitted as principal uses or
buildings within each zoning district are those uses listed in the use matrix
(Table 1103-2).
   (b)   Uses Not Mentioned. A use not specifically mentioned or described by
category in the use matrix (Table 1103-2) is prohibited. Evaluation of these
uses shall be as set forth in subsection (d) Interpretation-Materially Similar
Uses of this Section.
   (c)   Uses Preempted by State Statue. Notwithstanding any provision of this
section to the contrary, uses that are required to be permitted in any zoning
district by state statute may be permitted in accordance with state law whether
or not the use is included in the use matrix (Table 1103-2).
   (d)   Interpretation - Materially Similar Uses. The Building and Zoning
Inspector shall determine if a use not mentioned can reasonably be interpreted
to fit into a use category where similar uses are described. Interpretations
may be ratified by the Village Council upon recommendation by the Planning
Commission at a regularly scheduled meeting. It is the intent of this Section
to group similar or compatible land uses into specific zoning districts, either
as permitted uses or as uses authorized by a CUP. Uses not listed as a
permitted use or CUP are presumed to be prohibited from the applicable zoning
district. In the event that a particular use is not listed in the use matrix
(Table 1103-2), and such use is not listed as a prohibited use and is not
otherwise prohibited by law, the Building and Zoning Inspector shall determine
whether a materially similar use exists in this section. Should the Building
and Zoning Inspector determine that a materially similar use does exist, the
regulations governing that use shall apply to the particular use not listed,
and the Building and Zoning Inspector's decision shall be recorded in writing.
Should the Building and Zoning Inspector determine that a materially similar
use does not exist, the matter may be referred to the Planning Commission for
consideration for amendment to the zoning code to establish a specific listing
for the use in question. Unless an appeal is timely filed pursuant to Section
1107.09 Appeals to the Building and Zoning Inspector of the code, the Building
and Zoning Inspector's decision is valid. If, when seeking periodic
ratification of interpretations, the Building and Zoning Inspector's
interpretation is reversed then decisions made in reliance on the Building and
Zoning Inspector's interpretation are in violation of the zoning code.

1103.17 RESIDENTIAL ESTATE (RE) DISTRICT.
   Residential Estate districts are the designation for a low-density
residential use on a lot that is a minimum of one (1) acre. "RE" districts
implement the following policies by:
   •   Ensuring that proposed land uses and development are compatible in their
use, character, and size to the site and the surrounding areas;
   •   Based on a comprehensive land-use plan, encouraging more intensive
development in and near neighbor- hood centers with less intensive development
between neighborhood centers, and implementing these changes through zoning;
and
   •   Encouraging patterns of urban development that provide a full range of
housing choices and promoting a sense of community, urban vitality, and the
efficient provision of infrastructure.
   (a)   Permitted Uses. See Section
1103.11 Use Regulations of this chapter.
   (b)   Dimensional Standards. The dimensional standards within the "RE"
(Residential Estate) district are outlined in Table 1103-4 (see Figure 1103-1).
   (c)   Building Design. Building design shall conform to the appropriate
building type design standards (Section
1105.27 Building Design).

1103.19 NEIGHBORHOOD SUBURBAN (NS).
   Neighborhood Suburban districts provide areas for low-density, single-family
uses that provide a buffer between the agricultural and "RE" (Residential
Estate) classifications and higher density. Minimum lot size requirements are
provided in order to allow for market and design flexibility while preserving
neighborhood character. "NS" districts encourage more intensive development in
and near neighborhood centers with less intensive development between
neighborhood centers. They provide a full range of housing choices and promote
a sense of community, urban vitality, and the efficient provision of
infrastructure.

1103.21  NEIGHBORHOOD URBAN (NU) DISTRICT.
   Neighborhood Urban districts provide areas for medium to high-density,
single- family residential uses mixed with a variety of housing types where
adequate public facilities and services exist with capacity to serve
development. These districts are composed mainly of areas containing a mixture
of single-family, two-family, and multifamily dwellings, and open space where
similar residential development seems likely to occur.
   The district regulations are designed to encourage a suitable neighborhood
environment for family life by including among the permitted uses such
facilities as schools and churches, and to preserve the openness of the area by
requiring certain minimum yard and area standards. Mixed residential districts
provide flexible minimum lot size and density requirements in order to allow
for market and design flexibility while preserving the neighborhood character
and permitting applicants to cluster development in order to preserve
environmentally sensitive and agricultural land areas. These districts
encourage more intensive development in and near neighborhood centers with less
intensive development between neighborhood centers. They provide a full range

1103.23 COMMERCIAL NEIGHBORHOOD (CN) DISTRICT.
   Commercial Neighborhood districts provide small areas for offices,
professional services, service, and shopfront retail uses-all designed in scale
with surrounding residential uses. The district regulations are designed to
protect and encourage the transitional character of the districts by permitting
a limited group of uses of a commercial nature, and to protect the abutting and
surrounding residential areas by requiring certain minimum yard and area
standards, which are comparable to those called for in the residential
districts. These districts are also intended to reduce auto trips by permitting
a limited group of commercial uses to be located in close proximity to
residential areas.
   These districts provide a balance of residential and nonresidential land-use
opportunities, reflecting the economic needs of residents and business owners.
"CN" (Commercial Neighborhood) districts implement the following policies by:
   •   Based on a comprehensive land-use plan, encouraging more intensive
development in and near neighborhood centers with less intensive development
between neighborhood centers, and implementing these changes through zoning;
and
   •   Encouraging resident and employment growth within walking distance of
the downtown area and neighborhood centers in order to support an inter- modal
transportation system.
   •   "CN" (Commercial Neighborhood) districts are limit ed to:
   •   The intersection of arterial/collector, collector/collector, and
collector/local street intersections, except where an existing commercial area
has been established prior to the adoption of this chapter; or
   •   The interior of a block along an arterial or collector street that lies
parallel to an existing commercial area.
   (a)   Permitted Uses. See Section
1103.11 of this Chapter.
   (b)   Dimensional Standards. The dimensional standards within the "CN"
(Commercial Neighborhood) district are outlined in Table 1103-7 (see Figure
1103-4)
   (c)   Scale. In addition to the provisions set forth below, the following
restrictions shall apply to the scale of buildings in each "CN" (Commercial
Neighborhood) district. Individual buildings shall not exceed the following:
      (1)   3,000 square feet of gross floor area for a single- use building;
or
      (2)   3,000-square-foot building footprint for a mixed- use building or a
live-work unit, so long as the building does not exceed two stories.
   (d)   Design.
      (1)   Parking areas for new buildings or structures shall be located in
the rear of the principal use or principal building. This subsection shall not
apply to buildings that exist at the time of a rezoning to "CN" (Commercial
Neighborhood)
      (2)   Parking areas for new buildings or structures shall be located in
the rear of the principal use or principal building. This subsection shall not
apply to buildings that exist at the time of a rezoning to "CN" (Commercial
Neighborhood).
      (3)   Buildings shall be articulated so that façades which face public
streets and exceed fifty (50) feet in horizontal length shall include vertical
piers or other vertical visual elements to break the plane of the façade. Such
vertical piers or any other vertical visual elements shall be between fifteen
(15) and forty (40) feet apart along the façade. This provision does not apply
to the conversion of a residential building to a commercial use.
   (e)   Service Entrances/Service Yards. Service entrances and service yards
shall be located only in the rear or side yard of the business use. Service
yards shall be screened from adjacent residential zones or uses by the
installation and maintenance of a solid wall or fence having a height of at
least four (4) feet or greater than six (6) feet, or vegetation having a
minimum height of four (4) feet. Refuse enclosures shall be located at the rear
of the site and screened with a wall and a gate.

activity, and to maintain the unique character of the center. Pedestrian
circulation is required as are common parking areas. Downtown districts:
   •   Promote the long-term vitality of the central business district;
   •   Encourage development of the downtown area as a complete neighborhood to
enhance its image to both visitors and residents;
   •   Accommodate a broad range of housing stock, including single-occupancy
hotels; low-, moderate-, and upper-income housing; and housing for elderly
persons; and
   •   Give priority to existing buildings, particularly vacant upper floors in
existing buildings, for meeting housing needs.

1105.01 OFF STREET PARKING.
   (a)   This section sets minimum standards for off-street requirements for
new construction and expansion of or changes to existing uses. The purpose of
this section is to ensure that uses have a minimum level of off-street parking
to avoid congestion on surrounding streets while avoiding excessive parking,
discouraging pedestrian access, driving up the cost of development, and
inviting excessive levels of traffic congestion, which creates increases in
flooding and nonpoint source pollution. On-street parking is also encouraged in
some locations in order to provide a buffer between pedestrians and vehicular
traffic.
   (b)   Parking Ratios.
      (1)   Generally.
         i.   Applicability. The minimum parking ratio standards apply to all
zoning districts except the "D" (Downtown) zoning district.
         ii.   Uses not identified. The Building and Zoning Inspector shall
determine the parking requirement for uses that do not correspond to the
categories listed in Table 1105-1. In such instances, the applicant shall
provide adequate information by which the proposal can be reviewed, which
includes but may not necessarily be limited to the following:
            a)   Type of uses;
            b)   Number of employees;
            c)   Building design capacity;
            d)   Square feet of sales area and service area;
            e)   Parking spaces proposed on site;
            f)   Parking spaces provided elsewhere; and
            g)   Hours of operation.
         iii.   Multiple uses. Where the application identifies accessory or
multiple uses within a structure or multiple structures, the minimum standards
shall apply to each use or structure. This does not apply to Section
1105.01(c), Shared Parking of this Section.
         iv.   Fractional measurements. When units or measurements determining
the number of required off-street parking spaces result in a fractional space,
then such fraction equal or greater than one-half shall require a full off-
street parking space.
         v.   Floor area measurement. Floor area and GFA are synonymous for
purposes of this Section (see "gross floor area," as defined in the Glossary,
Chapter
1111 Definitions).
         vi.   On-street parking. The minimum number of required off-street
parking spaces shall be reduced by the number of on-street parking spaces
abutting the property lines of the lot or parcel.
      (2)   Minimum Parking Ratios. Table 1105-1 establishes the minimum
numbers of parking spaces required for the uses indicated. For the purposes of
parking calculations, the gross area of any parking garage within a building
shall not be included within the GFA of the building. Parking requirements may
be met by one or more of a combination of the following methods:
         i.   Providing on-site parking spaces. Only spaces that are designed
consistent with this section are counted toward the minimum parking required.
Spaces at gasoline pumps and bays for auto repair/service are not counted
toward the minimum parking required. No part of a parking or loading space
required for any building to comply with this Section shall be included as part
of a parking or loading space required for another building.
         ii.   Making payments in lieu of parking spaces that shall be
contributed to a parking fund specifically set aside to provide public parking
within one-fourth (1/4) mile of the exterior boundaries of the proposed
development: The amount of the payment for each space shall be established by a
resolution of the Village Council and shall be reasonable and based on the
actual or estimated cost to provide such spaces. No development approvals shall
be issued until complete payment has been received by the Village of
Greenfield.
         iii.   Providing off-site parking spaces in a shared parking facility:
Shared parking facilities must conform to Section
1105.01(c), Shared Parking of this Section.
      (3)   Maximum Parking Ratios.
         i.   Table 1105-1 indicates the maximum number of parking spaces
established for the use or structure. If a maximum parking space ratio applies,
the number of parking spaces shall not exceed the maximum number permitted.
         ii.   The maximum spaces allowed do not include accessible spaces
required by the Building Code.
   
   (c)   Shared Parking.
      (1)   Generally. Parking spaces required under this section may be
provided cooperatively for two (2) or more uses in a development or for two (2)
or more individual uses, subject to the requirements of this section.
      (2)   Cooperative Parking. Off-street parking requirements of a given use
may be met with off-site, off-street parking facilities of another use when,
and if, all of the following conditions are met:
         i.   The off-site, off-street parking facilities are within 300 feet
of the property;
         ii.   The parking demands of the individual uses, as determined by the
administrator based upon minimum off-street parking requirements, are such that
the total parking demand of all the uses at any one time is less than the total
parking stalls required;
         iii.   A written agreement between the owners and leases executed for
a minimum of twenty (20) years, approved by the Building and Zoning Inspector
as provided in subsection (iv), below. The application shall be recorded and a
copy maintained in the project file. Should the lease expire or otherwise
terminate, the use for which the off-site parking was provided shall be
considered non- conforming and any and all approvals, including CUPs, shall be
subject to revocation. Continuation or expansion of the use shall be prohibited
unless the use is brought into compliance with the parking regulations of this
division;
         iv.   An application for approval of a cooperative parking plan shall
be filed with the Building and Zoning Inspector by the owner of the entire land
area to be included within the cooperative parking plan, the owner or owners of
all structures then existing on such land area, and all parties having a legal
interest in such land area and structures. Sufficient evidence to establish the
status of applicants as owners of parties in interest shall be provided. The
application shall include plans showing the location of the uses or structures
for which off-street parking facilities are required, the location of the off-
street parking facilities, and the schedule of times used by those sharing
parking in common; and
         v.    Pursuant to the same procedure and subject to the same
limitations and requirements by which the coop-parking plan was approved and
registered, any such plan may be amended or withdrawn, either partially or
completely, if all land and structures remaining under such plan comply with
all the conditions and limitations of the plan, and all land and structures
withdrawn from such plan comply with the regulations of this division.
      (3)   Shared Parking. Developments that contain a mix of uses on the same
parcel, as set forth in Table 1105-2, may reduce the amount of required parking
in accordance with the following methodology:
         i.   Determine the minimum parking requirements in accordance with
Table 1105-1 for each land use as if it were a separate use;
         ii.   Multiply each amount by the corresponding percentages for each
of the five time periods set forth in Columns (B) through (F) of Table 1105-2;
         iii.    Calculate the total for each time period; and
         iv.   Select the total with the highest value as the required minimum
number of parking spaces.
      (4)   Shared Easement Maintenance Agreements.
         i.   A maintenance agreement made between the owners of shared
easements for ingress and egress that sets out responsibility percentages shall
be recorded with the County Recorder after examination by the Planning
Commission and Map Office. In terms of a lease, such agreements may be spelled
out in the lease and a memorandum filed with the City Clerk or Building and
Zoning Inspector.

      (1)   Truck loading facilities are required in all zones other than the
"D" (Downtown) district for structures containing uses devoted to businesses,
industry, manufacturing, storage, warehousing, processing, offices,
professional buildings, hotels, multiple-family dwellings, hospitals, airports,
railroad terminals, and any buildings of a commercial nature.
      (2)   If a structure is enlarged, expanded, or changed, it shall not be
used, occupied, or operated unless it has at least the amount of off-street
truck loading facilities that would apply if the increment were a separate
structure.
   (b)   Responsibility. The provision for and maintenance of the off-street
truck loading facilities shall be the joint and several responsibility of the
operator and owner of the land upon which the structure requiring the
facilities is located.
   (c)   Types and Location. There shall be two (2) sizes of off-street truck
loading spaces designated: "large" and "small." Each large space shall have an
overhead clearance of at least fourteen (14) feet, shall be at least twelve
(12) feet wide, and shall be at least fifty (50) feet long, exclusive of access
or maneuvering area, platform, and other appurtenances. Each small space shall
have an overhead clearance of at least ten (10) feet, shall be at least eight
(8 ) feet wide, and shall be at least twenty (20) feet long, exclusive of
access or maneuvering area, platform, and other appurtenances.
   (d)   Location. Off-street truck loading facilities shall be located on the
same lot on which the structure for which they are provided is located.
However, loading facilities that are available under a cooperative arrangement
may be located on another site not more than 300 feet from the structure for
which they are provided. Service entrances and service yards shall be located
only in the rear or side yard. Service yards shall be screened from adjacent
residentially zoned or used property by the installation of a buffer yard.
   (e)   Drainage and Surfacing. Areas shall be properly graded for drainage;
surfaced with concrete, asphaltic concrete, or asphalt; and maintained in good
condition free of weeds, dust, trash, and debris.
   (f)   Lighting. Lighting facilities shall be so arranged that they neither
unreasonably disturb occupants of adjacent residential properties nor interfere
with traffic.
   (g)   Combined Facilities. Requirements for the provision of off-street
truck loading facilities with respect to two or more structures may be
satisfied by the permanent allocation of the required number of spaces for each
use in a common truck loading facility. The total number of spaces designated
in a common truck loading facility shall be at least the sum of the individual
requirements unless the Building and Zoning Inspector determines that a lesser
number of spaces will be adequate. In determining the number of revised spaces,
the Building and Zoning Inspector shall consider the respective times of usage
of the truck loading facilities by the individual users and the character of
the merchandise.

      (1)   No zoning certificate, variance, conditional use permit, similar
use determination, subdivision plat or site plan and design approval shall be
granted until a landscape plan is approved in accordance with this Section.
      (2)   No landscaped area shall be used for display and/or storage
purposes.
      (3)   The species, location and spacing of trees and shrubs planted in
all public rights-of-way and on all sites shall be subject to approval by the
Building and Zoning Inspector.
      (4)   No Certificate of Occupancy shall be granted until all conditions
herein have been met; however, in the event landscaping cannot be completed due
to weather conditions, or peculiar conditions related to the development of the
subject property such as conditions related to phased development, the
applicant shall provide financial security, in a form acceptable to the
Village, in the amount of one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the cost of
materials and installation of all remaining landscaping to be completed and an
estimate of such costs in order to be eligible for a Certificate of Occupancy.
      (5)   When phasing development upon a property, a proportionate share of
landscaping acceptable to the Village shall be installed and maintained with
each phase based on the size of the proposed phase and shall be considered
completed for the purposes of these regulations when such proportionate share
of landscaping has been installed, unless special circumstances warrant the
installation of a greater amount of landscaping with any phase.
      (6)   The developer and/or property owner shall be responsible for the
installation and maintenance of all landscaping, buffering, perimeter treatment
and screening improvements in a healthy condition. This provision shall also
apply to single-family and two-family dwellings.
      (7)   Bare earth shall not be considered landscaping or a landscaped area
for the purposes of meeting the landscape requirements herein. Land area shall
be considered "covered" if it is used for growing grass, shrubs, trees, plants
or flowers, or if covered by decorative rock, stone or wood chips, or otherwise
landscaped as provided herein. This provision shall also apply to single-family
and two-family dwellings.
      (8)   These landscaping provisions are not intended to require multiple
or overlapping setbacks, buffers and perimeter treatments. When more than one
(1) such standard applies, that standard which results in the higher
landscaping or buffering requirement shall apply. Buffering and perimeter
treatments may be located within the required setbacks and may be counted
toward required open space except not as usable open space.
      (9)   Utility easements which conflict with required buffer yards,
perimeter treatment, parkway or median standards may require an alternative
design approach to address such conflicts.
   (d)   Tree Preservation. Unless exempted in accordance with this subsection,
all existing major trees shall be preserved. The Building Inspector may approve
the cutting down, removal or destruction of a major tree/trees when the tree or
trees interferes with the proper development of the lot, provided that the lot
is the subject of an application for approval of a zoning certificate,
development plan approval or variance, such application is approved and one of
the following applies:
      (1)   The tree or trees will be located within the public right of way.
      (2)   The subject property cannot be arranged in a manner to avoid
removal of the tree or trees at the same time permitting the desirable and
logical development of the lot.
      (3)   The tree/trees are located within the proposed driveway to service
a single-family home, and such driveway cannot otherwise be relocated.
      (4)   The tree is damaged or diseased or can be proven to be of poor
quality.
      (5)   The tree/trees are an undesirable species in its present location
   (e)   Tree Replacement. Each existing major tree removed in accordance with
subsection (d) above shall be replaced with one (1) tree, having a minimum
caliper of one and three-quarters inch (1 3/4") as measured one foot (1') above
ground level.
   (f)   General Landscape Standards.
      (1)   The following standards shall ensure that landscaping is used to

a functional purpose and year-round interest and/or screening.
      (2)   The size of landscape elements and materials shall meet minimum
standards and be consistent with the size of the project and any existing
streetscape. Minimum plant sizes are as follows:
      (3)   Landscaping in parking areas, driveway entrances and intersections
shall be designed to meet the minimum clear sight triangle as defined in the
Zoning Code.
      (4)   Monoculture, or the extensive use of a single species of trees,
shall be limited in order to minimize the potential for disease or pests to
strike a particular species resulting in significant same-species loss. The
following limits shall apply:

public improvements. A protective tree grate and vault shall be provided when
trees are planted in paved areas such as plazas or sidewalks. This provision
shall also apply to single-family and two-family dwellings.
      (4)   When an applicant presents that the placement of all trees and
shrubs as required in this section would create an impractical landscape
effect, a portion of the trees and shrubs may be located in alternative
locations on the same site, subject to approval by the City Manager or
designee.
      (5)   In no event shall a landscaped setback be less than six feet (6')

shall be two and one-half feet (2 ½') for a large tree, two feet (2') for
medium tree and one and on-half feet (1 ½') for a small tree. In areas where a
sidewalk exists or is proposed, the minimum distance between the tree trunk and
both the edge of the street and the sidewalks shall be two feet (2') for a
large tree, two feet (2') for a medium tree and one and one-half feet (1 ½')
for a small tree, as defined in approved street tree list.
      (5)   Trees shall be located so that a twenty-foot (20') sight triangle
is maintained at street intersections.
      (6)   A small tree shall be used when planting under or within ten (10)

plan that establishes the species and size of trees to be planted along the
streets of the proposed subdivision.
      (8)   The developers shall be required to maintain all trees for a period
of one (1) year after any installation and replace any tree which fails to
survive or does not exhibit normal growth characteristics of health and vigor
within such one (1) year period. Upon completion of a street tree planting, the
landscape contractor shall contact the Building and Zoning Inspector for a
preliminary inspection. The one-year guarantee period shall begin after the
approval of the Building and Zoning Inspector. A final inspection shall be made
at the end of the guarantee period. All trees not exhibiting a healthy,
vigorous growing condition, as determined by the city's inspection, shall be
promptly replaced at the expense of the developer. Upon replacement, the one-
year guarantee period shall recommence for those materials having been
replaced.
      (9)   Most new plantings should be watered in daily for a week of one (1)
inch deep of water each day, and after that, weekly waterings of at least one
(1) inch deep. Measurable rain of at least one (1) inch is an acceptable
substitute for one (1) watering. All plantings should be inspected for
infestation and physical damage to the crown, trunk, branches and roots. A
qualified arborist should be consulted about infestations and pruning, as well
as choice of trees in a singular planting or replanting
      (10)   All street trees along any one street shall be of the same species
and variety to promote a continuous landscape treatment. A change in variety
will only be permitted at intersections and other logical beginning and ending
points.

Strobe or flashing lights and exposed neon lights are not permitted. Lighting
fixtures shall not generate excessive light levels, cause glare, or direct
light beyond the facades onto neighboring property, streets, or the night sky.
The maximum illumination of any vertical surface or angular roof surface shall
not exceed four (4) footcandles.
      (6)   Security lighting shall be full, cut-off type fixtures, shielded
and aimed so that illumination is directed to the designated areas with the
lowest possible illumination level to effectively allow surveillance.
      (7)   Lighting fixtures used to illuminate the area below a freestanding
canopy shall be recessed so that the lens cover is recessed or flush with the
bottom surface (ceiling) of the canopy. However, indirect lighting may be used
where a shielded source of light is beamed upward and then reflected down from
the underside of the canopy.

by the Permittee.
         iii.   In the event that such independent tests reveal that any small
cell installation or installations owned or operated by Permittee or its
Lessees, singularly or in the aggregate, is emitting RF radiation in excess of
FCC exposure guidelines as they pertain to the general public, the Village
shall notify the Permittee and all residents living within 1500 feet of the
small cell installation(s) of the violation, and the Permittee shall have
forty-eight (48) hours to bring the small cell installation(s) into compliance.
Failure to bring the small cell installation(s) into compliance shall result in
the forfeiture of all or part of the Compliance Bond, and the Village shall
have the right to require the removal of such installation(s), as the Village
in its sole discretion may determine is in the public interest.

(Ord. 32-2020. Passed 1-19-21.)
1105.23 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   Applicability. Every permitted use and conditional use permit shall
conform to the performance standards in this Section and to the laws and
regulations of the State of Ohio and of the federal government. Any use
permitted by this Zoning Code may be undertaken and maintained if acceptable
measures and safeguards are employed to limit dangerous and objectionable
elements to acceptable limits as established by the performance standards.
Compliance with these standards shall be required during all times of operation
of the approved activity or use.
   (b)   Existing Use. An existing use which does not conform with these
performance standards shall not be enlarged or remodeled if: the enlargement or
remodeling will cause greater noncompliance with the performance standards
which exist at the time of the proposed enlargement or remodeling; or if the
nonconforming conditions are not brought into compliance as a result of or
concurrently with the enlargement or remodeling.
   (c)   Measurement Procedures. Methods and procedures for the determination
of compliance with these performance standards shall conform to applicable
methodologies prescribed by this Zoning Code or to applicable standard
measurement procedures published by the American National Standards Institute,

Association, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, and other recognized
organizations whose standards are acceptable to the Zoning Official.
   (d)   Studies to Demonstrate Compliance. When the Building and Zoning
Inspector or the Board of Zoning Appeals determines that either the information
provided by the property owner is not sufficient to determine compliance with
the performance standards without providing additional studies or expert
advice, or that the information provided by the owner is of such nature,
complexity, or quantity that the Building and Zoning Inspector or the Board is
not able to make a determination of compliance without additional studies or
expert advice, then the Building and Zoning Inspector shall advise the owner
that such studies or advice are required. The Building and Zoning Inspector and
the Board may accept the required studies prepared by qualified professionals
engaged by the owner or the owner shall deposit funds with the Village as
required to pay for such studies or expert advice.
   (e)   Control of Objectionable Processes and Operations. The Building and
Zoning Inspector or Board of Zoning Appeals, prior to the issuance of a zoning
certificate, may require the submission of statements and plans indicating the
manner in which dangerous and objectionable elements, including those described
in the following performance standards, involved in processing and in equipment
operations are to be eliminated or reduced to acceptable limits and tolerances.
   (f)   Performance Standards. The following performance standards shall be
applicable to the operation of any use permitted under this Zoning Code.
      (1)   Fire Hazards. Any activity involving the use or storage of
flammable or explosive materials shall be protected by adequate firefighting
and fire suppression equipment and by such safety devices as are normally used
in the handling of any such material. Such hazards shall be kept removed from
adjacent activities to a distance which is compatible with the potential danger
involved.
      (2)   Radioactivity or Electrical Disturbance. No activity shall emit
dangerous radioactivity at any point or electrical disturbance adversely
affecting the operation at any point of any equipment other than that of the
creator of such disturbance.
      (3)   Noise and Vibration. All activities shall comply with the
provisions of Section 509.11 of the Codified Ordinances and all other
regulations of the Village relating to noise and vibration.
      (4)   Smoke Emission. Smoke shall not be emitted with a density greater

the USEPA Extremely Hazardous Substances List, which may be detrimental to the
public health, safety or general welfare or which may endanger the natural
environment. Provisions for the proper storage, use, and disposal of hazardous
and/or toxic materials shall conform to the standards and requirements for such
materials established by the USEPA and OEPA. (Ord. 32-2020. Passed 1-19-21.)
1105.25 NON-CONFORMITIES.
   (a)   Administration of Non-Conformities.
      (1)   The following sets forth the rights of a property owner to
continue, enlarge, repair, alter, replace, or discontinue a non-conforming use
or structure.
      (2)   Table 1105-10 summarizes the decisions relative to nonconformities
and the role of each of the administrative, quasi-judicial, quasi-legislative,
and legislative reviewing parties.
   (b)   Applicability. Non-conforming uses are declared by this Code to be
incompatible with permitted uses in the zones and districts involved. A non-
conforming use of a structure, a non-conforming use of land, or a non-
conforming use of structure and land in combination, shall not be extended or
enlarged after passage of this Code by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition
of other uses, of a nature which would not be permitted generally in the zone
or district involved.
   (c)   Effect of Actual Construction. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in
this Code shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or
designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun
prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Code and upon
which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. Actual
construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials
in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or
demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially commenced,
such substantial excavation, demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that work is carried on diligently after such
excavation, demolition or removal. For the purposes of this Section 9.05
substantial excavation, demolition or removal shall mean the completion of at
least seventy-five percent (75%) of the scope of applicable work
   (d)   Single-Family Dwellings. In any zone or district in which single-
family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary
accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Code notwithstanding limitations imposed
by other provisions of this Code. Such lot must be in separate ownership and
not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This
provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for
area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district or zone,
provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to
area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the
district or zone in which such lot is located, except that the minimum side
yards may be reduced ten percent (10%) of the width of the lot, provided that
no side yard shall be less than the least of the applicable district or zone
regulation and three feet (3'). Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained
only through action of the BZA.
   (e)   Contiguous Lot. If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots and
portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at
the time of passage or amendment of this Code, and if all or part of the lots
do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands
involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this
Code, and no portion of such parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which
diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this
Code, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot width or
area below the requirements stated in this Code.
   (f)   Alteration of Non-Conforming Structure.    No such non-conforming
structure may be enlarged or altered in a manner which increases its
nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease
its nonconformity. If lawful use of a structure, or of structure and premises
in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Code that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this Code,
the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject
to the following provisions:
      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Code
in the zone or district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the zone or district in which it
is located.
      (2)   Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any of the parts
of a building which were manifestly arranged or designated for such use at the
time of adoption or amendment of this Code, but no such use shall be extended
to occupy any land outside such building.
      (3)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the applicable zone or district, and the non-conforming
use may not thereafter be resumed.
      (4)   Where a non-conforming use has been discontinued, meaning that the
structure containing the use has remained vacant, unoccupied, unused or has
ceased the daily activities or operations which had occurred, for a period of
twenty-four (24) or more continuous months, the non-conforming use shall be
permanently terminated.
      (5)   Any non-conforming structure damaged to an extent of more than
seventy-five percent (75%) of its then fair market value, exclusive of
foundations, shall not be restored or reconstructed, used or occupied as a non-
conforming use. If such damage amounts to seventy-five percent (75%) or less of
the fair market value, the non- conforming structure may be restored, provided
a building permit is obtained and that such restoration shall begin within one
year from the time of damage. The BZA may approve the reconstruction of a non-
conforming structure damaged to a greater extent than permitted herein upon
review of a site and design plan submitted in accordance with the requirements
for site and design plan submittal.
   (g)   Continuation of Non-Conformity.
      (1)   If lawful use of a structure, or of structure and premises in
combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Code
that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this Code, the
lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
         i.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Code
in the zone or district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the zone or district in which it
is located.
         ii.   Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any of the
parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designated for such use
at the time of adoption or amendment of this Code, but no such use shall be
extended to occupy any land outside such building.
         iii.   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on
which a non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the applicable zone or district, and the non-
conforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
         iv.   Where a non-conforming use has been discontinued, meaning that
the structure containing the use has remained vacant, unoccupied, unused or has
ceased the daily activities or operations which had occurred, for a period of
ninety (90) or more continuous months days, the non-conforming use shall be
permanently terminated.

structure existing on the effective date of this Code, which use or structure
does not conform with one (1) or more of the provisions of this Code, shall be
deemed a non- conforming use or structure under the provisions of this Code.
Provided that such non-conforming use or structure was established in
conformance with the zoning provisions in effect prior to adoption of this
Code, and provided that such use or structure was established under
authorization of and in conformance with a permit or other authorization issued
by the Village, then such use or structure shall be a lawful non-conforming use
or structure and shall be permitted to continue under the provisions of this
Code.
(Ord. 32-2020. Passed 1-19-21.)
1105.27 BUILDING DESIGN.
   (a)   Purpose and Findings: The purpose of these regulations is to provide
specific criteria so that new buildings blend into the historic architectural
framework of the Village of Greenfield. These criteria are not intended to
restrict imagination, innovation, or variety, but rather to assist in focusing
design principles, which can result in creative solutions that will develop a
satisfactory visual appearance within the Village of Greenfield; preserve
taxable values; and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.
These standards:

systems to be located within the various zones, in association with a primary
use or principal structure, and installed and operated in a manner that is
consistent with the base zone and will not compromise adjacent uses.
      (3)   In the event of a conflict between the standards in this Section
and the standards in the applicable zones, the standards of this Section shall
control.
   (b)   Permit Required.
      (1)   Permits. Prior to the installation of a solar energy system, a
zoning certificate and building permit approval is required. When a Conditional
Use Permit is required, it is identified in the appropriate Section.
      (2)   Application. Applications for a solar energy system must be filed
on the form(s) provided by the Department, together with all required fees and/
or deposits in compliance with Section

determine compliance with this Code, then the Building and Zoning Inspector
shall deny the application and shall not issue a zoning certificate.
   (f)   The Building and Zoning Inspector may refer zoning certificates to the
BZA for review.
   (g)   Within fourteen (14) days of the Building and Zoning Inspector's

(Ord. 32-2020. Passed 1-19-21.)
1107.17 VARIANCES.
   (a)   The provisions set forth hereunder shall apply to the review and grant
of variances under this Code.
   (b)   An applicant seeking a variance shall submit a written request for
variance on forms provided by the Planning Zoning Administrator together with
the applicable fee. In addition to information relating to the subject property
and the applicant, the request for a variance shall include the following
information :
      (1)   A description of the nature of the variance requested and a
statement demonstrating the extent to which the requested variance conforms to
the standards for variance in this Code;
      (2)   A statement of hardship; and
      (3)   Such other information and exhibits as may be appropriate to
establish the facts of the appeal and the grounds for relief.
   (c)   Before approving or denying a request, the BZA shall hold at least one
public hearing on the matter. The BZA shall cause notice of the hearing to be
made to the public by seven (7) days advance publication, in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Village, of the place, time, date and the nature of
the variance applied for. The BZA shall also cause the subject property to be
posted with a notice of hearing at least seven (7) days prior to the day of the
hearing. The notice of hearing shall state thereon the nature of the request
and the time and place of the public hearing.
   (d)   No variance from the strict application of the provisions of this Code
shall be granted unless the BZA makes specific findings of fact, based on the
evidence presented to it, which support conclusions that the variance conforms
to the following standards:
      (1)   The variance is in accord with the general purpose and intent of
the regulations imposed by this Code in the district in which it is located and
shall not be injurious to the area or otherwise detrimental to the public
welfare.
      (2)   The variance will not permit the establishment of any use which is
not otherwise listed as a permitted use or a conditional use in the zone or
district in which the subject property is situated.
      (3)   There exist special circumstances or conditions, fully described in
the findings, applicable to the land or structures for which the variance is
sought, which are peculiar to such land or structures and which do not apply
generally to land or structures in the area, and which are such that the strict
application of the provisions of this Code would deprive the property owner of
the reasonable use of such land or structures. There must be a deprivation of
the beneficial use of land, as opposed to mere loss in value as justification
for the variance.
      (4)   There is proof of hardship or practical difficulty created by the
strict application of this Code, beyond simply a showing that greater profit
will result if the variance is granted. Economic hardship is not grounds for
the variance. Furthermore, the hardship complained of is not self- created nor
is it established on this basis by one who purchased with or without knowledge
of the restrictions. The hardship results from the application of this Code and
is suffered directly by the property in question.
      (5)   The variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or
building, and the variance as granted is the minimum variance that will
accomplish this purpose.
      (6)   The variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to
adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the public streets,
increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or substantially
diminish or impair property values of the adjacent area.
      (7)   The variance will not confer on the property owner any special
privilege that is unduly denied by this Code to other land, structures, or
buildings in the same district.
      (8)   No nonconforming use of neighboring land or structures in the same
district and no permitted or nonconforming use of land or structures in other
districts are considered as grounds for approval of the variance.
      (9)   The variance is not a matter of convenience when other remedies are
available within the provisions of this Code.
   (e)   In granting any variance, the BZA shall establish such conditions as
are necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this Code. Any
violation of such conditions and safeguards, when they have been made a part of
the terms under which the variance has been granted, shall be deemed a
violation of this Code.
   (f)   No action of the BZA granting a variance shall be valid for a period
longer than twelve (12) months from the date of such action unless the zoning
certificate is obtained within such period, and the erection or alteration of a
structure is started or the use is commenced within such period, provided
however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, such twelve (12)
month period may be extended by the Building and Zoning Inspector upon the
demonstration by the applicant that any delay in the commencement of the

with the standards and requirements of this Code and subject to conditions to
ensure compliance with this Code; or
      (2)   Deny the conditional use, upon finding that the application does
not comply with the provisions of this Code
   (f)   In approving a conditional use, the Building and Zoning Inspector or
the BZA, as applicable, may impose such conditions as deemed necessary to
protect the public welfare, preserve the purpose and intent of this Code, to
protect the character of the surrounding properties and neighborhood affected

appropriate given unique circumstances of the proposed use.
   (g)   Subsequent to approval by the Building and Zoning Inspector or the
BZA, and compliance with all applicable conditions of such approval and of this
Zoning Code, the Building and Zoning Inspector shall issue a zoning certificate
stating the conditional use and all conditions of its approval.
   (h)   Approval of a conditional use shall be void upon the occurrence of any

condition of the approval.
   (i)   The Building and Zoning Inspector shall review all approved
conditional use permit applications six (6) months after final action to

not begun, the Building and Zoning Inspector shall record that information for
an additional six (6) month review, and shall notify the BZA of such inaction.
      (3)   If the Building and Zoning Inspector finds a use in an existing
structure or building not to be in operation, the permit and zoning certificate
shall be deemed revoked and the Building and Zoning Inspector shall notify the
applicant of such revocation as well as the BZA. Upon such revocation, the
applicant shall have the right to appeal that decision of the Building and
Zoning Inspector to the BZA and request the BZA allow up to one (1) additional
six (6) month period to begin operation following the administrative appeal
procedure.

conditional use is being operated in a manner that violates any condition of
the use's approved permit, the permit and zoning certificate shall be
considered revoked. The Building and Zoning Inspector shall notify the permit
holder as such, who shall immediately discontinue operation of the use:

two (2) year period, the approval shall become void and the lot or parcel shall
revert to its last previous zoning district applied.
   (o)   An extension of the time limit may be approved by the Planning

inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Greenfield as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by City of Greenfield.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Highland County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Highland County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective March 3, 2011
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Greenfield as required by Section
1315.04  Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
         A.   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100 year
flood plain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard,
include: Flood Insurance Rate Map, Ross County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
effective April 2, 2003
         B.   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations.
Such maps and/or studies are on file at the Greenfield City Hall, 300 Jefferson
Street, Greenfield, Ohio.
            (Ord. 27-10. Passed 11-29-10.)
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Greenfield, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 26-09.
Passed 9-1-09.)
1315.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure: A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.

   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus 0 feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood
elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation
can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or
approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Greenfield's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction: Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Greenfield
Flood Insurance Rate Map, November 2, 1984, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 26-09. Passed 9-1-09.)

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Greenfield's flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section 
1315.01 (f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1315.04 (c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1), prepared in a format required
for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and
submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall
be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the City Manager of
City of Greenfield, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Greenfield have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Greenfield's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Greenfield boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Greenfield suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Greenfield has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1315.05 .
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1315.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the City Manager of City of Greenfield and the
Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Greenfield specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1315.03 (j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
            (Ord. 26-09. Passed 9-1-09.)
 
1315.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City Council shall appoint an Appeals Board consisting of five
(5) members. The members shall serve four (4) year terms after which time they
shall be reappointed or replaced by the City Council. Each member shall serve
until his/her successor is appointed.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed at
the City Manager's office in the Greenfield City Hall located at 300 Jefferson
Street, Greenfield, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall immediately transmit said notice and all pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the
Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall
schedule and hold a public hearing within forty-five (45) days, giving written
notice to parties in interest. The Board of Appeals shall issue a written
decision within thirty (30) days after the hearing is concluded
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in practical difficulties may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of
Greenfield
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in practical difficulties due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Highland County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 26-09. Passed 9-1-09.)
