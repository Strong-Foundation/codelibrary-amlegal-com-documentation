EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility allowing for
an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially are
odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation.
Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty
provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised Code.
Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated
by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs
between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

Section 2.15 Ordinances and Resolutions

introduced in writing and the adoption, effective date, revision, amendment and
signing thereof shall be as provided by the laws of Ohio, except as otherwise
provided by this Charter or, where not so otherwise provided by this Charter,
then, as Council may provide otherwise by ordinance or resolution.
Nevertheless, where this Charter or Council may not be contrary to Ohio law as
it relates to adoption, effective date, revision, amendment or signing of
ordinances or resolutions, due to the subject matter, as determined in case law
by a court of competent jurisdiction, it shall be as provided by the laws of
Ohio.
   (B)   Law Department Review. Every ordinance and resolution shall be
reviewed by the City's Department of Law before its enactment.
   (C)   Passage Requirements. Except as may otherwise be provided in this
Charter, ordinances, resolutions, motions or other actions, except procedural
matters, shall be valid and effective when enacted or passed by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the current members of Council. Each ordinance and
resolution shall be read on three (3) separate days, unless this requirement is
dispensed with by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the
current members of Council. Readings shall be by title only, unless the Council
requires readings be taken in full by an affirmative vote of its members.
Council may suspend any rule requiring three (3) readings of any matter by the
affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the current members of Council. Council
may pass an ordinance or resolution as an emergency measure by the affirmative
vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the current members of Council. Except as may
otherwise be provided in this Charter, Council may take action upon any other
procedural matter by the affirmative vote of a majority of those Council
members present at the meeting. Motions may not be a substitute for an
ordinance or resolution; however, the reverse is acceptable. Approval of
appointments may be by motion. Removals may be by motion, regardless if the
appointment was made in the form of an ordinance or resolution.
   (D)   Signature Requirement & Veto. Upon passage, every ordinance and
resolution of Council shall be signed by the presiding officer and shall be
presented promptly to the Mayor for his or her approval. If the Mayor approves
the ordinance or resolution as presented, he or she shall sign it. If the Mayor
does not approve the ordinance or resolution presented, in whole, he or she
shall, during the same meeting when the ordinance or resolution was passed,
veto such ordinance or resolution and during such meeting make a statement of
his or her objections. Upon receipt of the Mayor's veto and objections, Council
may reconsider its vote by approved motion utilizing any reconsideration
process established. Upon reconsideration, if Council approves the ordinance or
resolution by two-thirds (2/3) of the current members of Council, it shall take
effect the same as if it had received the Mayor's approval and signature. In
the event the Mayor is unable to attend a Council meeting where an ordinance or
resolution is being considered for passage, and the Mayor has prior notice
thereto, the Mayor may exercise his or her veto by filing the same in writing,
along with his or her objections, with the Clerk of Council prior to the
meeting. If the ordinance or resolution is passed, the Council Clerk shall
present the written veto and objections to the presiding officer on the Mayor's
behalf. The presentment of the same shall be treated as a valid veto and the
procedure herebefore provided shall be followed as though the Mayor was
present. In the event that the Mayor is absent from a Council meeting and an
ordinance or resolution is presented for passage without prior notice to the
Mayor, the Mayor shall be permitted ten (10) calendar days from the date of
passage to exercise a veto which may be exercised in writing in the manner
herebefore provided. The failure of the Mayor to strictly follow the veto
procedure as contained herein shall constitute a complete waiver thereof and
the ordinance or resolution shall stand enacted; moreover, the mere failure or
refusal of the Mayor or presiding officer to sign an ordinance or resolution
shall not invalidate the ordinance or resolution.
   (E)   Mayor's Order of Reconsideration. Upon failure of any ordinance or
resolution, the Mayor may order a one (1) time reconsideration by Council, so
long as such order is made at the same Council meeting when the ordinance or
resolution failed. No motion is required of Council upon an order of
reconsideration and, the Council shall immediately reconsider the proposed
ordinance or resolution at that meeting.
   (F)   Publication of Legislation. All ordinances and resolutions shall be
published one (1) time after passage in a newspaper of general circulation in
the City, and/or Council may determine that publication shall be by other
electronic media. Ordinances or resolutions containing words in excess of that
number provided for by ordinance or resolution of Council may be published
merely by summary. Council may establish criteria for what constitutes an
adequate summary. In the event of the publication of ordinances or resolutions
by summary, there shall be a notice in such publication that a copy of the
complete ordinance or resolution is on file in the office of the Clerk of
Council for inspection during business hours and that copies of such ordinance
or resolution shall be furnished to any person, upon request, for a reasonable
fee. The City Law Director shall review all proposed summary form publication
for legal accuracy and sufficiency prior to publication. The Clerk of Council
shall cause the ordinance or resolution to remain posted in the principal
municipal building for a period not less than ten (10) calendar days
immediately following the notice. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as
to prohibit publication in accordance with the laws of Ohio; moreover, in the
event there is no newspaper of general circulation in the City, or there are no
electronic media available, Council may provide some other method of
publication or giving notice of ordinances and resolutions, which may include,
but not necessarily be limited to, posting copies in two (2) public places
within the City.
   (G)   Publication in Book Form. When ordinances or resolutions are revised,
codified, rearranged, published in book form, and certified as correct by the
Clerk of Council and the Mayor, publication of a notice of such action shall be
a sufficient publication. A new ordinance or resolution so published in book
form, which has not been published as required by the laws of Ohio, this
Charter, or as otherwise provided by Council, and which contains entirely new
matter, shall be published as required by the laws of Ohio, this Charter, or as
Council may provide. If such revision or codification is made by the City and
contains new matter, it shall be a sufficient publication of such codification,
including the new matter, to publish, in the manner allowed by this Charter, a
notice of the enactment of such codifying ordinance or resolution, containing
the title of the ordinance or resolution and a summary of the new matters
covered by it. Revision and codification of ordinances and resolutions may be
made under appropriate titles, chapters, and sections and in one (1) ordinance
or resolution containing one (1) or more subjects.

by the Civil Service Commission, when determining the relative merit and
fitness of candidates for original appointment to positions under its

of candidates under the laws of Ohio. In such case, no extra credit for
seniority or efficiency shall be added to the score of any candidate for either

utilities which may be required in the interests of public health, safety, or
accommodation.
Section 7.02 Franchises

by law, no non-City owned or operated utility, including but not limited to,
gas, telephone, telecommunication, cable television, water, sewer or electric,
shall operate in the City without a franchise or prior permission of Council.

no record received, created, or maintained by the City related to any City
owned or operated utility is required to be released as a public record when,
disclosing such record would more likely than not provide or create a

of economic value to a competitor or a person other than the City.
ARTICLE IX - INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM AND RECALL 
Section 9.01 Initiative

Section 9.03 Removal From Office and Recall 
   (A)   Power to Recall. The electors of the City shall have the right and
power to remove from office by a recall election any officer of the City
holding an elective office, but only after that officer has served six (6)
months of his or her term. A petition demanding the removal of an elected
officer may be filed with the Clerk of Council, who shall note thereon the name
and address of the person filing the petition and the date of such filing, and
deliver a receipt to that person.
   The separate parts of the petition shall be bound together and filed as one
(1) document. Each part shall contain the name and office of the person whose
removal is sought and a statement in not more than two hundred (200) words of
the grounds for removal. The petition shall be signed by at least that number
of electors which equals twenty-five percent (25%) of the number of electors
voting at the last general municipal election. Within ten (10) days after
filing the petition, the Clerk of Council shall determine whether or not it
meets the requirements hereof. If the Clerk of Council finds the petition
insufficient, he or she promptly shall certify the particulars in which the
petition is insufficient, deliver a copy of his or her certificate to the
person who filed the petition, and make a record of such delivery. The person
who filed the petition shall be allowed a one (1) time period of twenty (20)
days after the day on which the delivery of the certificate was made to him or
her to make the petition sufficient. If the Clerk of Council finds the petition
sufficient, he or she promptly shall certify it to Council, deliver a copy of
the petition and his or her certificate to the officer whose removal is sought,
and make a record of such delivery if the officer does not resign.
   (B)   Failure to Resign. If the officer does not resign within five (5) days
after the day on which such delivery is made, Council, by ordinance or
resolution, shall fix a day for holding a recall election, not less than sixty
(60) days nor more than seventy-five (75) days after the date of such delivery.
The Clerk of Council shall certify the ordinance or resolution providing for
such election to the appropriate election authorities upon receipt from the
person filing the petition of a bond, cash, certified check or cashier's check
in an amount equal to the cost of such election as reasonably estimated by the
Clerk of Council, such security to be retained and used by the City to pay the
costs of the recall election if a majority of the votes cast are against the
recall of the officer, otherwise to be returned to the person filing the
petition upon certification of the results of the election.
   (C)   Ballot Wording and Eligibility of Appointment. At the recall election,
this question shall be placed upon the ballot substantially in the following
form or as otherwise permitted by the board of elections: "Shall (naming the
officer) be allowed to continue as (naming the office)?", with provisions on
the ballot for voting affirmatively or negatively. In the event a majority of
the vote is negative, the officer shall be considered as removed, his or her
office shall be considered vacant, and the vacancy shall be filled as provided
by this Charter, or if this Charter is silent, as Council may decide. The
person removed at the recall election shall not be eligible for appointment to
the vacancy thereby created.
   (D)   No Additional Recall. If an officer against whom a recall petition is
filed is continued in office by the vote at the recall election, no other
recall petition shall be filed against him or her for a period of two (2)
years.
   (E)   Removal by Council. Council may remove the Mayor or a Council member
for gross misconduct, malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office; or
for conviction while in office of a crime involving moral turpitude or for any
felony conviction; or if adjudicated legally incompetent; or for a violation of
his or her oath of office; or for persistent failure to abide by the Rules of
Council. However, such removal shall not take place without the concurrence
(affirmative vote) of five (5) members of Council, and also not until the
accused Mayor or Council member has been notified in writing of the charge
against him or her at least ten (10) days in advance of a public hearing upon
such charge, and at which time he or she (or his or her counsel should the
Mayor or Council member choose to retain counsel) shall be given an opportunity
to be heard and present evidence at a public hearing called by Council. An
accused member of Council shall not vote on the question of his or her removal.
Upon the removal of such officer, the vacancy thereby created in such office
shall be filled in the manner provided by this Charter, and the officer so
removed shall not be eligible for appointment to fill such vacancy.
(Amended November 8, 2016)
ARTICLE X - GENERAL PROVISIONS

to this Charter shall be as provided by this Charter, so long as not otherwise
prohibited by the Constitution of Ohio, and as provided by the Constitution of

but not less than a majority, shall become part of this Charter.
Section 10.02 Effect of Partial Invalidity

be done on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or City
recognized holiday or other legal holiday.
   (C)    Interpretation. In order that a ready means may be at hand for
reconciling any conflicts, resolving any inconsistencies and clarifying any
obscurities which may be discovered in the language of this Charter, the power

enacted, and which are not inconsistent with or contrary to this Charter, or
with ordinances, resolutions or other actions hereafter enacted or passed by

contained in this Charter shall be construed as limiting the power of Council
to enact any ordinance or resolution or take any other action not in conflict
with the Constitution of Ohio or with the express provisions of this Charter.

assessments therefor. All ordinances, resolutions and other actions of the City
in force on the effective date of this Charter and not inconsistent with or
contrary to its provisions shall continue in full force and effect until

under any ordinance, resolution or other action of the City, in force on the
effective date of this Charter or any amendments thereto, shall, if such
office, board, commission or department is abolished by this Charter, be
thereafter exercised and discharged by the officer, commission, board or

thereafter enacted.
Section 11.04 Continuance of Present Employees

meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments

amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments

simultaneous operation.

of Council may consider among other matters:

      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the

   106.01 REJECTION OF BIDS.
   When in the opinion of Council, the award by a director (i.e. City Manager,

is not in the best interest of the City, Council shall state the reason in the
minutes and may accept another bid or proposal opened for award, or reject all
bids or proposals and advertise for other bids or proposals, or order the
applicable director to proceed or not proceed with the purchase or project.

all irregularities and informalities therein. Council shall not be obligated to
proceed with any project or service, in full or in part, or the purchase of
equipment, material, or supply in full or in part, in the event that any bid or
proposal is rejected or any contract is not awarded. Moreover, any rejection of
any bid or proposal may be done by motion of Council, with no further
legislation being required to re-bid the project, service, equipment, material,
or supply. Any such re-bid may be authorized by motion of Council. (Ord. 36-01.

and all of its departments may purchase materials, supplies, equipment or
services from others, including other political subdivisions of this State as
defined in Section 125.04(B) of the Revised Code, upon equivalent terms,
conditions, and specifications but at a lower price than it can be obtained
through any of Ohio’s cooperative purchasing program without necessity of
competitive bid. The department making said purchase shall cause to be
maintained sufficient information regarding the purchase to verify that the
department satisfied the conditions for making a purchase under this section.
Nothing in this section restricts the City or its departments from taking any
other action that may be permitted by law.
   (b)   (1)   Subject to approval for expenditure of funds when required, and
except as provided herein, when materials, supplies, equipment or services to
be purchased are authorized for competitive bid by the City, the City Council
or department director (i.e. City Manager, City Law Director, or City Finance
Director as applicable) specifically has the right to disregard the bidding
process completely, at any time, so long as bids have not yet been received,
and to:
            A.   Contract for the purchase of materials, supplies, equipment or
services from a person or an entity who is authorized by the current State
Cooperative Purchasing Contract which is in effect at the time of the bid, to
sell such materials, supplies, equipment or services to the City or its
departments under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 125.04 or 5513.01 and Ordinance
(s) 63-88, 36-99 or similar ordinances passed by the City, as each may be
amended from time to time; or

         (2)   If bids have been received and the purchase can be made upon the
same terms, conditions and specifications at a lower price through the State’s
Cooperative Purchasing Contract, then the bid may be:
            A.   Rejected;
            B.   Awarded to the lowest and best bidder; or
            C.   Awarded via the State Cooperative Purchasing Contract.

members currently serving on Council for passage. Specifications, plans, and
related bid documents for any bid requiring the same shall be on file with the
office of the City Finance Director, such documents requiring Council approval
prior to the bid process.
   (b)   The Director of the department for which a contract is being bid may
issue an addendum to the contract, specifications, plans and related documents
without necessity of Council approval. Any such addendum shall be provided to
Council prior to award.
(Ord. 36-01. Passed 5-7-01.)
   106.04  COMPETITIVE BIDDING ELIMINATED.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting the power of the City
to enter into professional service contracts, leases, or other type of
purchases not required by law to be by competitive bidding. Nevertheless,
contracts or agreements for professional services, sole source contracts or
agreements, and contracts or agreements which are necessitated by an emergency
that threatens the health or safety of the inhabitants of the City, or
contracts or agreements that are immediately necessary for the preservation or
replacement of City real or personal property or facilities, shall be exempt
from bidding. In addition, when the City may otherwise be required by the laws
of Ohio, ordinance or resolution, to make any purchase or contract of any type
of property or services, or contract for purchases or services by competitive
bid, the proposal process, or qualified base selection process, Council may
eliminate the necessity therefor in the best interest of the City, as
determined in the sole discretion of Council by a majority vote of the current
members of Council. Emergency purchase procedure shall be controlled by Section
105.03. (Ord. 36-01. Passed 5-7-01.)
   106.05 CONTESTING RELATED TO BIDS.
   Upon authorization for award of contract, the director who is responsible
for the contract shall furnish notice to any unsuccessful bidder or proposer of
the City's intent to award to another. Such notice may be made by regular U.S.
mail to the business address contained in the bid or proposal, personal
service, or by electronic mail or facsimile transmission at the address or
number contained in the bid or proposal. Notice shall be deemed received when
given if served personally or by electronic mail or facsimile transmission;
however, when served by regular U.S. mail, notice shall be deemed received
three (3) days after being deposited in a mail receptacle. The unsuccessful
bidder or proposer shall have ten (10) business days after notice is received
as provided herein to file a written protest with the City's Finance Director
clearly stating the grounds for the protest. Such protest shall be deemed
received when time stamped by the City Finance Director's office. The failure
to timely file a protest constitutes a complete waiver thereof. Upon the proper
filing of a protest, a meeting, informal in nature, shall be held within thirty
(30) days by the meeting board as designated in Section
106.06 or as otherwise determined by council. The disposition order of the
board shall be deemed a final order.

fact that such advertising and competitive bidding are being eliminated and the
reason why it is in the best interest of the City to do so shall be stated in
the legislation authorizing such action.
(1978 Code 37.08)
   107.05 DISPOSAL OF CITY PERSONAL PROPERTY.
   (a)   Sale of City’s Personal Property at Auction. Notwithstanding the other

   107.06 SALE OF SCRAP WIRE AND MISCELLANEOUS SCRAP BY ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT.
   (a)    Notwithstanding any law to the contrary as may be found in the Ohio
Revised Code, the procedure set forth in this section shall be one procedure
for the Electric Department to sell scrap wire accumulated by it and no longer
needed for any municipal purpose; however, not the exclusive procedure. Nothing
in this section shall be construed as to limit the City’s authority to dispose
of the scrap wire or other miscellaneous scrap in the same manner as any other
personal property as otherwise provided for in this chapter or in a manner as
proscribed by policy as implemented by the City Manager and the Electric
Distribution Superintendent when consented to by the City Finance Director.

(Ord. 70-01. Passed 6-4-01.)
   121.03  PUBLICATION OF LEGISLATION.
   (a)   Publication in General. All ordinances and resolutions shall be
published one (1) time after passage in a newspaper of general circulation in
the City, and/or Council may determine that publication shall be by other
electronic media. Ordinances or resolutions in excess of 1 (one) word may be
published merely by summary. A table of contents of the ordinance or resolution
and, if any attachments exist to the ordinance or resolution, a table of
contents for such attachments, shall be considered an adequate summary. In the
event of the publication of ordinances or resolutions by summary, there shall
be a notice in such publication that a copy of the complete ordinance or
resolution is on file in the office of the Clerk of Council for inspection
during business hours and that copies of such ordinance or resolution shall be
furnished to any person, upon request, for a reasonable fee. The City Law
Director shall review all proposed summary form publications for legal accuracy
and sufficiency prior to publication. The Clerk of Council shall cause the
ordinance or resolution to remain posted in the principal municipal building
for a period not less than ten calendar days immediately following the notice.
Nothing in this Section shall be construed as to prohibit publication in
accordance with the laws of Ohio.
(Ord. 070-12. Passed 12-3-12.)
   (b)    Notice When No Newspaper in City Exists. Notwithstanding any other
law applicable to publication, when no newspaper of general circulation exists
in the City, the means of publication of ordinances, resolutions, summaries of
ordinances and resolutions, and publication of all statements, orders,
proclamations, notices and reports, required by law to be published, shall be
accomplished by posting copies in not less than two (unless a greater number is
required specifically by the Ohio Revised Code) of the most public places in
the municipal corporation, as determined by Council, for a period of not less
than fifteen days. Notices to bidders for construction of public improvements
and notices of the sale of bonds shall be published in not more than two
newspapers, printed in this State and of general circulation in areas within a
100 mile radius of the City, for the time periods established as if a newspaper
did exist in the City. Where such publication is by posting, the Clerk shall
make a certificate as to such posting, and as to the times and the places where
such posting is done. Such certificate shall be prima-facie evidence that
copies were posted as required.
   (c)    Publication in Book Form. When ordinances or resolutions are revised,
codified, rearranged, published in book form, and certified as correct by the
Clerk of Council and the Mayor, publication of a notice of such action shall be
a sufficient publication. A new ordinance or resolution so published in book
form, which has not been published as required by the laws of Ohio, the
Charter, or as otherwise provided by Council, and which contains entirely new
matter, shall be published as required by the laws of Ohio, the Charter, or as
Council may provide. If such revision or codification is made by the City and
contains new matter, it shall be a sufficient publication of such codification,
including the new matter, to publish, in the manner allowed by the Charter or,
when permitted by the Charter, the ordinances and resolutions of the City, a
notice of the enactment of such codifying ordinance or resolution, containing
the title of the ordinance or resolution and a summary of the new matters
covered by it. Revision and codification of ordinances and resolutions may be
made under appropriate titles, chapters, and sections and in one ordinance or
resolution containing one or more subjects.
   (d)    Publication of Model or Standard Codes Adopted by City. In all cases
in which model or standard codes, in whole or in part, prepared and published
by public or private agencies on such matters as building construction,
plumbing, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, electric wiring, smoke
regulation, fire prevention and other similar regulations are adopted by
reference, full reproduction is not necessary. Publication may be satisfied by
placing at least one copy of each such code, or adopted parts thereof, in the
principal governmental building of the City, being the governmental building
where the Mayor's office is located, for reference and consultation by
interested persons during regular office hours. Such copy shall remain on file
as prescribed herein during its effective period.
   (e)    Effect of Not Making Publication. It is a sufficient defense to any
suit or prosecution under an ordinance or resolution, to show that no
publication was made as required by law that governs the publication procedure
of the City. Ohio R.C. 731.26 shall have no force or effect.
   
   (f)    Legislation or Measures Having Immediate Effect. Whenever Council is
required to pass more than one ordinance, resolution, or other measure to
complete the legislation necessary to make and pay for any public improvement,
the appropriate initiative and referendum procedure shall apply only to the
first ordinance, resolution, or other measure required to be passed and not to
any subsequent ordinance, resolution, or other measures relating thereto.
Ordinances, resolutions, or other measures providing for appropriations for the
current expenses of the City, or for street improvements petitioned for by the
owners of a majority of the feet front of the property benefitted and to be
especially assessed for the cost thereof, and emergency ordinances, resolutions
or other measures necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
health, or safety in the municipal corporation, shall go into immediate effect,

   155.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Establishment. There shall be a Civil Service Commission consisting of
three (3) members each of whom shall be a resident and qualified elector of the
City. Each member shall be appointed by the Mayor, subject to approval by
Council: one (1) for a term of two (2) years, one (1) for a term of four (4)
years, and one (1) for a term of six (6) years. Each alternate year thereafter,
the Mayor shall appoint one (1) person, as successor of the member whose term
expires, to serve a term of six (6) years, subject to approval by Council. Any
vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term. The Mayor, at any time, may
remove any member from office for misconduct, neglect of duty, malfeasance in
office, or other cause, subject to approval by Council. No more than two (2)
members shall be from the same political party. Civil service members shall
serve without compensation unless otherwise provided by Council.
   (b)   General Powers and Duties. The Commission’s power and authority is
derived from Article V,
§5.01(B) of the Charter and this chapter; moreover, pursuant to the Charter,
Council limits the power and duties of the Commission as follows: The
Commission shall have only the specific powers and authority that are conferred
upon it by this chapter and/or other City ordinances, resolutions, codes, rules
and procedures, as approved by the Council. Furthermore, the powers and
authority of the Commission may only be altered by Charter amendment, by
ordinance or resolution of Council, code or rules and procedures as approved by
the Council.
   (c)   Specific Authority. Said Commission is authorized and directed, by
Council, to: (i) promulgate, adopt, enforce, amend, and/or administer rules and
procedures governing the administration and operation of civil service
including, but not limited to, governing appointments and promotions within the
classified competitive positions of the City; (ii) review of suspensions,
demotions, reductions and removals of those employees in classified positions
who are entitled to such review under the City’s personnel code, Civil Service
Code, and/or ordinance or resolution of Council as a result of disciplinary
action; (iii) conduct review of other employees as provided for in the Charter,
or by ordinance or resolution of Council; (iv) investigate civil service
violations; (v) issue subpoenas under the hand of the Chairman or Acting
Chairman and; (vi) do all other things as assigned by the Council. The rules
and procedures adopted by the Commission and/or the provisions of the City’s
personnel code and/or the City’s Administrative Code shall replace and/or
supersede State civil service law to the extent the City may replace and/or
supersede the same, including, but not limited to, Chapter 124 of the Ohio
Revised Code (except for §124.57 and, merely to the extent required for the
lawful implementation and proper administration of any of the locally adopted
civil service rules and/or procedures and to the extent provided for in the
locally adopted civil service rules and/or procedures, §§124.09(G), 124.34 &
124.40) and State Civil Service Administrative Code or any later amendments
thereto. Any such rules and/or procedures established by the Commission shall
not be in conflict with the City Charter, ordinance or resolution of Council,
or the Constitution of Ohio. Any adoption of civil service rules and/or
procedures shall be by majority vote of all current members of the Commission
in favor of adoption, subject to approval by ordinance or resolution of
Council.
      (1)   Where local civil service rules provide for the suspension and/or
waiver of rules and/or procedures governing civil service, suspension and/or
waiver is permitted by the Commission, without prior approval of Council;
however, Council may by ordinance or resolution prohibit a suspension and/or
waiver of any rule.
      (2)   When civil service rules and/or procedures are submitted to Council
for approval, such rules and/or procedures shall be considered as a whole and
approved or denied as such. If Council determines to disapprove any such rules
and/or procedures or amendments thereto, Council shall submit in writing, to
the Commission, within ten days, the reason for such denial. Any such rules
and/or procedures shall not be enforceable until approved by Council.
   (d)   Civil Service Exclusion. Excluded from the services of the City Civil
Service Commission are the following agencies: the City Health Department and
the City School District and all employees, board members, commission members
and all other positions thereof, herein mentioned or not, unless either such
agency contracts with the City for those services.
   (e)   Service Status. The civil service of the City shall be divided into
the unclassified service and the classified service.
      (1)   The unclassified service shall be comprised of those positions
found in letters A. through I. of this paragraph (e)(1), which shall not be
included in the classified service and which shall be exempt from all
examinations required by civil service laws, and are exempt from Commission
review of suspensions, demotions and removals.
         A.   All officers or persons elected by popular vote or persons
appointed to fill vacancies in such offices;
         B.   The members of all boards and commissions, City Manager, City Law
Director, City Finance Director and other appointed officers or employees who
are subject to appointment and removal by Council;
         C.   The Clerk of the Municipal Court and deputies thereto; also,
Municipal Court Bailiffs and Probation Officers;
         D.   The Clerk of Council;
         E.   All employees of the City School District and the City Health
District as controlled by §124.11(A) or other applicable sections of the Ohio
Revised Code;
         F.   Assistant City Managers, Assistant City Finance Directors,
Assistant City Law Directors;
         G.   Such students in normal schools, colleges, and universities of
the State of Ohio who are employed by the City, City School District or City
Health District in student or intern classification;
         H.   Employees who receive external interim, intermittent, or
temporary appointments and part-time and permanent part-time employees; and
         I.   Other positions designated as unclassified by Charter or by
ordinance or resolution of Council.
      (2)   The classified service shall be comprised of all persons in the
employment of the City, not specifically included in the unclassified service,
and except those positions or agencies specifically excluded herein. The
classified service consists of two subclasses, which shall be designated as the
competitive class and the noncompetitive class.
         A.   The competitive class shall include all full-time police
officers, including the Chief of the Police Department and all full-time Fire
Department personnel, including the Chief of the Fire Department. Appointments
to the competitive class shall be by fitness and merit. In order to determine
fitness and merit for these positions, appointments shall be made by
competitive examination and any other means prescribed by the rules and
procedures of the Commission or as otherwise provided by ordinance or
resolution of Council. Except as may be otherwise provided by Council,
appointments shall be made to, or employment shall be given in, all positions
of the competitive class that are not filled by reinstatement, transfer or
reduction, as provided by law, and the rules and procedures of the Civil
Service Commission, by appointment from those certified to the appointing
authority in accordance with the civil service rules and procedures.
         B.   The noncompetitive class shall include all other positions of the
City that are not listed in the competitive class or the unclassified service
of the City’s civil service, including, but not limited to, any position that
may be considered unskilled labor and except those positions or agencies
specifically excluded herein. It has been determined by City Council that it is
not practical to have competitive testing for positions within the
noncompetitive class; therefore, vacancies in the noncompetitive class shall be
filled by appointment from properly filed applications. No competitive
examination or tests are required for this class by civil service, but work
related tests may be required by the appointing authority. These tests, if any,
shall be conducted and graded by the appointing authority or their designee and
no eligibility list is required to be used or maintained.

   156.01 DONATIONS ACCEPTED; FUND ESTABLISHED.
   (a)   City boards and commissions are empowered to accept in the name of the
City any donation of money, securities, equipment, or any personal property
which, in itself or the proceeds from which, is to be for a City use or for the
general public use, subject to subsequent approval by motion of Council at the
next regularly scheduled Council meeting (except that, subsequent approval by
Council is not required for donation amounts below $100.01). Such recipient
board or commission shall recommend to City Council the approval of such
donation or restriction upon the donation or of any execution of any trust
prior to the motion for approval by Council being made. However, gifts to the
City or the general public of real property, either absolutely or in trust,
which, in themselves or the proceeds from which, are to be used for City use or
for the general public use, shall be accepted by the City only after they shall
have been recommended by the recipient board or commission to the City Council,
and approved by legislation thereof. Upon recommendation of the board or
commission, subject to the approval by legislation of City Council, the City or
its designated officer may execute every trust or restriction imposed upon the
use of property rights by deed, treatment, or other conveyance, transferring
the title of such property to the City or to the general public for City use or
for use by the general public.
   (b)   The Finance Director is authorized and directed to establish a fund or
funds for acceptance of donations received under the authority of this section
either as a “general donation fund”, or “specified donation fund” that is
specific to the board or commission, as deemed appropriate by the Finance
Director. The total anticipated proceeds from such donations are deemed
appropriated for such donated purpose by this Council and are deemed in the
process of collection within the meaning of Ohio R.C. 5705.41; therefore,
immediate expenditure for the purpose the money was donated is authorized,
except that any expenditure in excess of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) shall
require Council approval prior to expenditure.

   (c)   Council's Inherent Authority Regarding Utilities. Nothing in this
section shall be construed as to limit Council's power and authority to pass
legislation in regard to any subject matter contained in this section that may
be inconsistent to the advice and recommendation of the Board of Public
Affairs. Further, Council is not barred from acting on any legislation
concerning any subject matter contained in this section, nor is the City

   Council hereby creates and establishes a Records Commission in and for the
City composed of the Mayor or his appointed representative, as chairman, and
the Finance Director, the City Manager, the Law Director, and a citizen
appointed by the Mayor.
(Ord. 56-94. Passed 7-18-94.)
   173.02 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   Council deems necessary that the Records Commission shall have those powers
and duties that are provided for in this section and Chapter 149 of the Ohio
Revised Code and other applicable laws of Ohio.
(Ord. 56-94. Passed 7-18-94.)
   173.03 OFFICERS.

   The functions of the Commission shall be to provide rules for retention and
disposal of records of the City as a municipal corporation and to review
applications for one-time records disposal and schedules of records retention
and disposition submitted by the City offices, including its boards, committees
and commissions. Records may be disposed of by the Commission pursuant to the
procedure outlined in Section
173.05, and where not in conflict with ordinance or charter, then according to
the laws of Ohio. The Commission may at any time review any schedule it has
previously approved, and for good cause shown may revise that schedule.
(Ord. 56-94. Passed 7-18-94.)
   173.05 DISPOSAL OF RECORDS.
   (a)   Following the approval by the department or agency heads, schedules of
record retention and disposal or applications of one time records disposals are
to be submitted to the Records Commission for approval or amendment. Except as
provided in subsection (d) hereof, prior to records disposal, approval of the
Ohio Historical Society and the Auditor of the State of Ohio is required. Each
of these agencies shall be permitted sixty days to review records before
disposal, giving them the opportunity to disapprove the same. The failure of
either agency to disapprove the applications within the prescribed period shall
constitute a waiver thereof.
   (b)   Once all appropriate authorities have reviewed and approved the
various retention and disposal documents, destruction or transfer of records is
permitted when they reach the end of their assigned retention period, subject
to the 15 day notification period as found in paragraph (d).
   (c)   Once records have been destroyed or transferred, a certificate of
records disposal shall be prepared and forwarded to the Records Commission with
one original and one copy forwarded to the Ohio Historical Society. The Ohio
Historical Society will forward the copy provided to the Ohio State Auditor.
The certificate of records disposal serves as the official record of the actual
disposal.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any other provision herein, once the retention periods
have been established and approved by all authorities, records may be disposed
of in accordance with the retention schedule without seeking new authorization
for each disposal; however, the office or agency intending to dispose of the
records shall file a certificate of (intended) records disposal, a minimum of
fifteen days prior to disposal, with the Records Commission. The Records
Commission shall forward the certificate to the Ohio Historical Society. If no
disapproval is made by the Ohio Historical Society by the expiration of the
fifteen-day period, the records shall be destroyed and such certificate serves
as the official record of the actual disposal. The submission of the
certificate may be in accordance with the state agencies’ procedures if they
differ from what has been stated herein. State certification language may be
altered to conform with actual procedures developed by state agencies or this
chapter.
   (e)   Mailing of any notice as provided for in this chapter may be made by
regular U.S. Mail or other means as acceptable to the Ohio Historical Society.
Unless the mail is returned to the sender, it shall be deemed received. The
period of time shall commence from the date of mailing.
(Ord. 063-07. Passed 8-6-07.)

receive no additional compensation for serving on said Commission. Further,
appointees by the Mayor to the Commission shall receive no compensation for
serving on the Commission.
(Ord. 56-94. Passed 7-18-94.)

the approval of Council. Further, appointments made by the Mayor to the
Commission shall be for a period of time not to exceed seven months for the
first term and in any case said appointment shall expire on January 1 of the
year following the appointment. Thereafter, the term of appointment shall be
for a period of five years. The Mayor may remove any member, at any time, for
misconduct, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, subject to the approval
by Council.
(Ord. 56-94. Passed 7-18-94.)
   173.08 RECORDS RETENTION POLICY.
   (a)   The Records Retention Policy currently on file in the office of the
City Finance Director, marked RDP2007-1, is hereby adopted for the City.
   (b)   Any typographical, scrivener, or clerical error found in the Records
Retention Policy may be corrected by the City Manager upon joint approval of
the City Law Director and City Finance Director without the necessity of
further action or legislation of Council; further, no one other than the City
Manager, City Finance Director and City Law Director acting jointly, who are
the three appointing authorities established in the City’s Personnel Code, may
alter, revise, or modify any of the policies in the Records Retention Policy,
the same being hereby permitted without further action of this Council.
(Ord. 063-07. Passed 8-6-07.)
   173.09 RECORDS EXEMPTION.
   In addition to what is exempt under the laws of Ohio, pursuant to Article 8,
Section
8.02 (B) of the Charter, notwithstanding any provision of the laws of Ohio, no
record received, created, or maintained by the City related to any City owned

Further, except for when a person falls into the class of a non-transient
guest, no exemption claimed under this chapter shall be granted except upon a

   Any tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guests to the
operator, and each operator shall collect from the transient guests the full
and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the party making such assertion

(Ord. 100-95. Passed 9-18-95.)
   191.14 RECORDS.
   Each operator shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents. If the operator furnishes lodging to any person or entity not
subject to this tax, the person and reason shall be identified (or attached) on
the invoice. Such records and other documents shall be opened during business
hours to the inspection of the Finance Director/designee and shall be preserved

   191.15 RETURN AND PAYMENT; PENALTIES FOR NONPAYMENT.
   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of each month following the
close of each calendar quarter year, or at the close of any shorter reporting
period which may be established by the Finance Director/designee, make a return
to the Finance Director/designee, on forms collected by transient occupancies.
The Finance Director/designee may establish policy for prepayment of estimated
tax. All claims for exemption from tax filed by occupants with the operator
during the reporting period shall be filed with the report. At the time the
return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the
Finance Director/designee by the operator. The Finance Director/designee may
establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he/she deems
it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he/she may require
further information in the return if such information is pertinent to the
collection of the tax. Returns and payments that are due by operators pursuant
to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the City until
payment thereof is made to the Finance Director/designee.
   (a)   Original Delinquency. That any operator who fails to remit any tax
imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a delinquency
penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax, in addition to the
tax.
   (b)   Fraud. If the Finance Director/designee determines that the non-
payment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty
equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of tax shall be added thereto
in addition to the delinquency penalty stated in subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   Interest. In addition to the previous stated penalties imposed, any
operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest
at a rate of one-half of one percent (.5%) per month, or fraction thereof, on
the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the
remittance first became delinquent until paid.
   (d)   Penalties During Pendency of Hearing of Appeal. No penalty provided
under the terms of subsections (a) and (b) hereof shall be collected during the
pendency of any hearing provided for herein, nor during the pendency of any
appeal to the Board of Review provided for herein.
   (e)   The officer or employee having control or supervision, or charged with
the responsibility of filing the return and making the payment, shall be
personally liable for failure or refusal to file the return or pay the taxes,
penalty and interest due as required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy, or
reorganization of any such employer does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of such business to file a return or
pay such taxes, penalties, and interest due.
   (f)   Payment is considered received for penalty and interest purposes by
the postmark if mailed, or by the date actually hand delivered to the City
Finance Director/designee (Tax Department) with the requirement of a "date
received" stamp in the latter case.
(Ord. 97-96. Passed 9-16-96.)
   191.16 TAX ASSESSMENT; NOTICE; HEARING.
   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect said tax that is required by
this chapter, and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report
and remittance of said tax or on any portion thereof required by this chapter,
the Finance Director/designee shall proceed in such manner as he/she may deem
best to obtain facts and information on which to base his/her estimate of the
tax due.
   As soon as the Finance Director/designee shall procure such facts and
information as he/she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of
any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by the operator who has failed or
refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he/she

not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Finance Director/designee shall
determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written
notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and
the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due

place for hearing such appeal, and shall give notice in writing to such
operator at operator's last known place of business. The findings of the Board
of Review shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant
in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount

   (a)   Each employer within the City of Napoleon who employs one or more

imposed by this chapter.
   (b)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (a) of this section, when
an employer within the City of Napoleon employs a Napoleon resident in another
taxing municipality which requires the employer to deduct the tax for such
taxing municipality from the Napoleon resident employer there, such employer

between the tax imposed by such other taxing municipality and the tax imposed

Napoleon tax if the Napoleon resident/employee is employed in a location which
does not impose municipal tax.
   (c)   Each employer shall, on or before the last day of the month following
the close of each calendar quarter, make a return and pay to the Finance

the responsibility of filing the return and making the payment, shall be
personally liable for failure to file the return or pay the taxes, penalty and
interest due as required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy, or reorganization

for a prior failure of such business to file a return or pay taxes and penalty
and interest due.
   (g)   The Finance Director, for good cause shown, may extend the period for
filing any return required to be filed under this section.

any deduction for payment by the taxpayer taken on the taxpayer's tax return to
be disallowed.
(Ord. 135-04. Passed 12-6-04.)
   193.18 ANNUAL RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Each taxpayer who engages in business, or whose salaries, wages,
commissions and other compensation are subject to the tax imposed by this
chapter and all residents of the City with income subject to the tax shall,
whether or not a tax be due thereon, make and file a completed and signed tax
return on or before April 15th of each year with the Department of Taxation
unless exempted from filing by administrative rules. The taxpayer shall set
forth the aggregate amount of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned by the taxpayer, and/or gross income from such business
less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross income,
earned during the preceding year and subject to the tax, together with such
other pertinent information as the Finance Director may require. Copies of
federal forms used to determine income subject to the City tax shall be
attached to the City tax return. Provided, however, that when the return is
made for a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the
return shall be filed within three months and fifteen days from the end of such
fiscal year or other period. A return is considered timely filed if received or
postmarked on or before the due date. The return shall also show the amount of
the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and profits. The taxpayer
making the return shall, at the time of the filing thereof, pay to the
Department of Taxation the amount of taxes shown as due thereon.
   (b)   Any taxpayer who has not reached the age of 18 by the end of the tax
year is not required to file a tax return as set forth in division (a) of this
section, but remains subject to the requirement that any tax due must be paid.
   (c)    If an individual is deceased, any return required of that individual
under this chapter shall be made and filed by the fiduciary of his estate or
other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (d)   If an individual is unable to make a return required by this chapter,
the return required of that individual shall be made and filed by his duly
authorized agent, guardian, fiduciary or other person charged with the care of
the person or property of that individual.
   (e)   Returns required of an estate or trust shall be made and filed by the
fiduciary thereof.
   (f)   Each return required to be filed under this chapter shall be signed by
the taxpayer or his duly authorized agent, and by the person who prepared the
return for the taxpayer, and shall include the taxpayer's social security
number or employer identification number.
   (g)   Each return required to be filed under this chapter shall be filed in
proper form and include any payment due. Any payment due shall be made payable
to "City of Napoleon--Income Tax Department", unless the amount shown to be due
is less than $1.00, in which case such amount need not be remitted.
   (h)   Joint filing by married taxpayers is permitted.
   (i)   A taxpayer who has requested a federal filing extension may be granted
an extension to file their City return for the same extended period. To be
granted the City extension, the taxpayer must file a copy of the federal filing
extension request with the Department of Taxation on or before the due date of
the City return and the filing of the extension request must be postmarked or
delivered to the City tax office on or before the due date. Further, the
taxpayer must not be delinquent in the filing of tax returns for any prior
years or delinquent in the payment of any prior year's taxes, penalties or
interest. If all of the above conditions are met, the taxpayer shall be granted
an extension to the same date as that granted by the Federal Internal Revenue
Service (IRS). The extension to file the City tax return is not an extension to
pay any tax due. Interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month or fraction
thereof and a penalty of two percent (2%) or fraction thereof will be assessed
from the original due date of the tax return until the date of actual payment
provided payment in full is received on or before the extended date. If the
taxpayer fails to file the City return on or before the extended date, penalty
and interest will be assessed from the original due date of the return. (ORC
718.05(D))
   (j)   Any taxpayer whose taxable income is adjusted by another tax
authority, which adjustment causes a change to the taxpayer's City taxable
income for the same period, must file an amended return with the Department of
Taxation within 60 days of said adjustment. The amended return must set forth
the nature of the adjustment and the taxpayer must pay any tax due or claim any
refund due of any overpayment. Only interest at 1% per month will be assessed
if the taxpayer complies with this section of the Code. If the taxpayer fails
to comply, then penalty and interest will be assessed from the original due
date of the City Tax Return.
   (k)   Each resident of the City who is 18 years of age and over is required
to register with the Department of Taxation on forms to be provided by the
Department of Taxation regardless whether or not the resident has income
subject to the tax. This registration shall be required at the discretion of
the Tax Administrator.
   (l)   The Finance Director will accept from a corporate taxpayer a
consolidated income tax return from any affiliated group of corporations if the
affiliated group filed a consolidated income tax return for federal income tax
purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code for the same tax
reporting period. (ORC 718.06)
   (m)   In the case of a corporation that carries on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates, or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory, or activity within the City
constituting a portion only of its total business. The Finance Director shall
require such additional information as it may deem necessary to ascertain
whether net profits are properly allocated to the City. If the Finance Director
finds net profits are not properly allocated to the City by reason of
transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by stock
ownership, interlocking directorates or transaction with such division, branch,
factory, office, laboratory or activity, or by some other method, the Finance
Director shall make such allocation as he or she deems appropriate to produce a
fair and proper allocation of net profits to the City.
   (n)   A taxpayer may file a tax return using a generic form which is an
electronic or paper form designed for reporting estimated or annual tax
liability. The generic form, to be considered acceptable, must contain all of
the information required to be submitted with a non- generic tax return
including all supporting reports or documents.
(Ord. 091-08. Passed 1-5-09.)
   193.19 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX; PAYMENT.
   (a)   Every taxpayer with an estimated tax liability of $300.00 or more
shall make a declaration of estimated City tax for the current taxable year.
The declaration shall be filed on or before April 15th of each year or on or
before the 15th day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes subject to
City tax for the first time. A taxpayer reporting on a fiscal year basis shall
file a declaration on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
   (b)   "Estimated City tax" means the amount which the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be his City tax for the current taxable year, less the amount
which he estimates to be withheld or paid to another taxing municipality on
account of such City tax.
   (c)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules and regulations of the
Council. The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be increased
or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date as provided in
this section.
   (d)   Such declaration to be filed on the 15th day of April of the year,
shall be accompanied by payment of at least twenty-two and one-half percent (22
½%) of the estimated annual tax due after permissible deductions:
      (1)   Any portion of such tax to be deducted or withheld at the source
pursuant to this chapter,
      (2)   Any credits allowable under the provisions of this chapter, and
      (3)   Any overpayment of previous year’s tax liability which the taxpayer
has not elected to have refunded.
   At least a similar amount must be paid on or before the 31st day of July and
again paid on or before the 31st day of October of the tax year, and again paid
on or before the 31st of January of the subsequent tax year. A final return
must be filed and any balance which may be due must be paid on or before the
due date set forth in Section
 193.18. The amounts due on the above mentioned subsequent quarter dates are
not to exceed forty-five percent (45%), sixty-seven and one-half percent (67
½%) and ninety percent (90%) respectively of the tax estimated to be due.
Should it then appear that such taxpayer has paid more than the amount of tax
to which Napoleon would be entitled under the provisions of this chapter, such
overpayment shall be applied against any subsequent liability hereunder, or, at
the election of the taxpayer and so indicated on the tax return, such
overpayment (or portion thereof) shall be refunded, but in no event shall
overpayments of less than one dollar ($1.00) be refunded.
   (e)   If a taxpayer's total quarterly estimate payments do not equal at
least ninety percent (90%) of the total tax liability as established on the
taxpayer's annual tax return, interest and penalty shall be assessed at the
following rates and in the following manner:
      (1)   The taxpayer's annual tax liability as established on the
taxpayer's annual return shall use the same percentage breakdown as found in
subsection (d) above as read in its entirety. The difference between the amount
of tax which should have been paid quarterly on an estimated basis and the
amount of tax actually paid quarterly on an estimated basis shall be subject to
a penalty of one percent (1%) per month or fraction thereof from the due date
of each quarterly installment to the date the annual return is due or the tax
paid thereon, whichever is earlier.
      (2)   In the event the taxpayer provides satisfactory evidence to the Tax
Administrator that the taxpayer's annual income fluctuated in such a manner
that the penalty as specified in division (e)(1) immediately above should not
be imposed, or for any good cause shown, the Finance Director may waive any
portion of such penalty upon request of the taxpayer and submission of evidence
of such fluctuation or other good cause to the Tax Administrator.
      (3)   For estimate filing year 2003 and thereafter, in the first year of
residency in the City where the taxpayer was never before a resident of the
City and moved to the City subsequent to January 1 of the tax year, for this
year, there will be no assessment of penalty and interest due to late or
insufficient income tax estimates.
         (Ord. 135-04. Passed 12-6-04.)
   193.20 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   Civil actions to recover City tax and interest and penalties on City
tax shall be brought within three years after the tax was due or the return was
filed, whichever is later.
   (b)   Claims for refund of City tax shall be brought within the time
limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under this chapter shall
be commenced within three years after the commission of the offense, provided
that in the case of fraud, failure to file a return, or the omission of 25% or
more of the compensation or net profits required to be reported, prosecutions
may be commenced within six years after the commission of the offense.

as found in Section
193.02 of the City’s Codified Ordinances, a permanent tax on certain
compensation and net profits as hereinafter provided in this section.
   (b)   Imposition of Tax. The additional annual tax for the purpose specified
in subsection (a) hereof is levied at the rate of one-fifth percent (.2%) per

concerned, including the tax for the recreation fund that was in effect prior
to amendment of this section that covered a period from January 1, 1996, it
shall continue effective until all of said tax levied under this section is
fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the collection of said
tax or for the punishment of violations of this section have been fully

paid into the Recreation Fund of the City. No part of said tax shall be
appropriated or used to defray the costs of collecting said tax or the costs of

is collecting a sufficient amount of income tax under Sections
193.01 through
193.20 , both sections inclusive, (as they now exist or as may later be amended
from time to time) to defray such costs. If at any time while this section is
in effect, said tax becomes the only income tax collected by the City, there
shall first be appropriated from the funds derived from said tax such part
thereof as shall be deemed necessary to defray all costs of collecting said tax
and of administering and enforcing the provisions hereof. The balance remaining
after such costs shall be allocated to the Recreation Fund of the City.
   (e)   Incorporated by Reference. All provisions of Sections
193.01 through
193.20, both sections inclusive, and
193.98 and
193.99, and all income tax rules and regulations shall govern and apply to this
section and said tax levied hereunder.

the City to impose the tax provided for in this section.

193.98 and
193.99 shall apply to this section, such sections which may be amended from

for the use or benefit of the City, (3) Extension, enlargement, maintenance and
improvement of municipal services and facilities, (4) Capital improvements in
and of the City, and (5) For the promotion of economic development in and for
the City, there is hereby levied a tax at the rate of one percent (1%) upon all
the following through June 30, 2009. Effective July 1, 2009, on and after said
date, there is hereby levied a tax at the rate of one and three-tenths percent
(1.3%) upon all of the following:
      (1)    All salaries, wages, and other compensation and net profits earned
or received by resident individuals;
      (2)    All salaries, wages, and other compensation and net profits earned
or received by non-resident individuals for, or derived from, or as a result
of, work done, services rendered and business conducted in the City;
      (3)    All net profits attributable to the City earned by all resident
and nonresident unincorporated businesses, professions and other activities
for, or derived from, work done, rentals or services performed, and business or
other activities conducted in the City;
      (4)    The entire portion of the distributive share of all net profits,
not otherwise attributable to the City, earned by a resident, individual,
resident owner of an unincorporated business entity, or resident partner for,
or derived from, work done, rentals or services performed, and business or
other activities conducted outside the City, and not otherwise lawfully levied
against by another municipality;
           (5)    The entire portion of the distributive share of all net
profits, not otherwise attributable to the City, earned by a non-resident

performed, and business or other activities conducted in the City and not

            (9)    The gross proceeds earned or derived from gaming, wagering,
lotteries, including but not limited to the Ohio State Lottery, or lotteries
where the State of Ohio is a part thereof, or games or schemes of chance, by
residents of the City; and/or, the gross proceeds earned or derived from
gaming, wagering, lotteries, or games or schemes of chance, when any part of
the activity is engaged into or conducted in the City, by nonresidents, are all
subject to the City tax to the same extent includable on the recipient's
federal tax return, whether or not the recipient is required to file a federal
tax return and whether or not the recipient pays federal income tax on the
gross proceeds, except that it shall not be taxed as a business income unless
the person subject to this tax has a federal gamblers' permit effective during
the tax year in which income from gaming, wagering, lotteries or schemes or
games of chance is received.
   (B)    The portion of the net profits attributable to the City of a taxpayer
doing work, rendering services or conducting business both within and outside
the City shall be determined in the same proportion as the average ratio of the
following:
            (1)    The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business in the City during the
taxable period to the average original cost of all real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business during the same period,
wherever situated. As used in this paragraph, real property shall include

be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight (8);

such result.

the City regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from stock of
goods within the City;

and salespeople in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and
the sales result from such solicitation or promotion;
           (3)    All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from
a place within the City to purchasers outside the City regardless of where
title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees and salespeople
regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where
delivery is made.

   194.014 STATEMENT OF PROCEDURAL HISTORY; STATE MANDATED CHANGES TO MUNICIPAL
INCOME TAX.
   (A)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to ORC 718 were enacted by Am
Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich
on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal corporations to conform to
and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have the authority to impose,
enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
   (B)   As mandated by H.B. 5, this Municipal Income Tax Ordinance 053-15,
effective January 1, 2016, comprehensively adopts Chapter
194 in accordance with the provisions of ORC 718 to allow the City to continue
the income tax and withholding tax administration and collection efforts on
behalf of the City.
(Ord. 053-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   194.02 EFFECTIVE DATE; FISCAL YEAR.
   (A)   Ordinance 053-15, effective January 1, 2016, and corresponding changes
to ORC 718, apply to municipal taxable years beginning on or after January 1,
2016. All provisions of this Chapter
194 apply to taxable years beginning 2016 and succeeding taxable years.
   (B)   Ordinance 053-15 does not repeal the existing sections of Chapter
193 for any taxable year prior to 2016, but rather adopts Chapter 194 effective
January 1, 2016 and continuing for each taxable year thereafter. For municipal
taxable years beginning before January 1, 2016, the City shall continue to
administer, audit, and enforce the income tax of the Municipality under ORC 718
and Ordinances and Resolutions of the City as that Chapter and those Ordinances
and Resolutions existed before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   The City tax shall be levied, collected and paid with respect to
compensation earned or received and with respect to the net profits earned or
received on a calendar year basis, except as herein provided. When the fiscal
year of a taxpayer is other than the calendar year that may be otherwise
permitted by law, and a modification of this Tax Code impacts such fiscal
taxpayer, then the City tax shall be levied upon that part of the net profits
for the fiscal year which are earned or received on or after the effective date
of such modification until the close of the taxpayer's fiscal year, and,
thereafter, shall be levied on the taxpayer's fiscal-year basis.
(Ord. 053-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   194.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this Chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this Chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code. For purposes of this Section
194.03, the singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall include
the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this Chapter:

C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation

income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (A)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)    Add an amount equal to five per cent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition

      (C)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or

The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than

one or more taxable years by operation of division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this
section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in
division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section shall apply to the amount carried
forward.
      (I)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or

Section
194.063 of this Chapter.
      (J)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or

income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of Section
194.063 of this Chapter.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (47)(B) of this section, is not a
publicly traded partnership that has made the election described in division
(23)(D) of this section, and is not an individual, the taxpayer shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (1) of this section shall be construed as allowing the

allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.

payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
194.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying

disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding

withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the

responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this

performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to

employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform

tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
    (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
194.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
194.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining. Notwithstanding
division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year, the number of days an
individual performs personal services at a petroleum refinery exceeds twelve,

twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying wages to the individual and
for all subsequent days in the calendar year on which the individual performed
services at the refinery.

operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)    A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)    The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent (50%) of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)    For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or
annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or
filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at
the rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
194.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

   194.06 INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX.
   194.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS; LOSSES.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
194.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
194.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
194.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section
194.062 of this Chapter.   
      (4)   Losses.
         (a)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable
year, allocable to the City, may be applied against the portion of the profit
of succeeding years allocable to the City until exhausted, but in no event for
more than five taxable years. No portion of a net operating loss shall be
carried back against net profits of any prior year.
         (b)   The net profits and losses sustained by a taxpayer from business
activities subject to the City tax, other than from the taxpayer's principal
source of income, shall be aggregated for each of the taxpayer's tax years. If
the result of such aggregation is a net profit, tax will be imposed and paid on
the net profit. If the result of such aggregation is a net loss, the net loss
may be carried forward to any of the succeeding five years and may be used
against an aggregate net profit for any of these five succeeding tax years.
         (c)   In a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2017, the
amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
            (1)   No person shall use the deduction allowed to offset
qualifying wages.
            (2)   For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, or
2022, a person may not deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a
municipal corporation that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, more
than fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the deduction.
            (3)   For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a person
may deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a municipal corporation
that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, the full amount allowed.
            (4)   Any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward deduction that
is available must be utilized before a taxpayer may deduct any amount.
(Ord. 053-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   194.062 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.

Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
194.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B) (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
194.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
194.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in division (I) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made
and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
   A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
194.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
194.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
   This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (I)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and
may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in
accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more than one
qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business. such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
194.05 et seq. on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of
personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year:
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election.
the provisions of Section
194.062 apply to such apportionment except as otherwise provided in this
division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
emplovee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpaver conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(A) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (I)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (A)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (A)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages. salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (A)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (B) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with res pect to all
or a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
as described in division (B) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Sections
 194.05 et seq.
         (Ord. 053-15. Passed 11-16-15; Ord. 052-23. Passed 12-18-23.)

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.

   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
194.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,

of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the

purpose of making the computations required in Section
194.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the

the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less

taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
194.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
194.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,

member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.

election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the

      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid

194.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)    For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is

annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.

the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
194.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of

for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for

year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
194.091 of this Chapter for that year.

was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that

   (A)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the municipality who is
required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter/
ordinance, may claim a nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this
chapter/ordinance upon satisfactory evidence that tax has been paid to another
municipality. The credit shall not exceed seventy percent (70%) of the amount
obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying wages, commissions, net profits
or other compensation subject to tax in the other municipality by the lower of
the tax rate in such other municipality or the tax rate imposed under this
chapter/ordinance.
   (B)   If a resident of Napoleon operates a business or businesses in another
taxing municipality and the business or businesses incur a loss, the amount of
the loss is deemed primarily subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the other
taxing municipality and may not be used to reduce the taxpayer's Napoleon tax
base.

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are

should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
194.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
194.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
194.096 of this Chapter.

any other miscellaneous income), then that taxpayer must file a timely tax
return for each year in which income other than retirement income or Social

   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment. For
purposes of this section, “receiving that payment” refers to the transfer of
funds from the account of the taxpayer. Such funds are no longer under control
of the taxpayer once the timestamp has occurred.
         (Ord. 036-16. Passed 1-19-16.)
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
194.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
194.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 053-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   194.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 053-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   194.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 053-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   194.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.

for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of the
Municipality’s income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall
be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
(Ord. 052-23. Passed 12-18-23.)
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the

facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty (60) days after the final determination of any federal
or state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
194.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or less, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
194.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
         (Ord. 053-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   194.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.    
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
194.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
194.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

   (E)    Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to the
compromise and settlement of tax claims;
   (F)    Exercise the authority provided by law relative to the use of

orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized and required to make and,
pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator's own
motion, review, redetermine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax
Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,
determination, computation, assessment or order which the Tax Administrator has
made for which an appeal has been filed with the Local Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
   (I)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

      (Ord. 053-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   194.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 053-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   194.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 053-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   194.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information. A taxpayer registration update
form is required of all residents eighteen years and older, and all businesses.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to section
194.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
section
194.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
194.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
 194.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
194.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law. (Source: ORC 718.26)
   (C)   Information Submission by Landlords. On or before May 1 of each year,
all property owners who rent to tenants of residential, commercial, or
industrial premises, shall file with the Tax Administrator, a report showing
the name, address, and phone number, of each tenant who occupies residential,
commercial, or industrial premises within the City of Napoleon. The list shall
also include all name(s), address(es), and phone number(s), of any tenant who
has vacated the property in the preceding twelve (12) month period. The list
should also include, when the information is available to the landlord, the
date in which the tenant vacated the property, along with the tenant's
forwarding address. If a landlord is not in possession of a former tenant's
forwarding address or other current contact information, the landlord will not
be penalized pursuant to any provision in this Section
 194.20. Any information referred to in this Section may be requested at any
time under audit by the Tax Administrator. Such report shall be in writing, and
shall be delivered to the Tax Administrator by one of the following methods:
      (1)   Regular U.S. mail delivery to the City Income Tax Department
      (2)   Delivered by electronic mail (E-mail) directly to the City Income
Tax Department
      (3)   Facsimile transmission directly to the City Income Tax Department
      (4)    Hand delivery to the City Income Tax Department.
   Forms and instruction for reporting shall be made available on the City's
website. For purposes of this Section (B) C, "tenant" means:
      (1)   If there is a written lease or rental agreement, the person(s) who
signed the written lease or rental agreement with the owner or their agent.
      (2)   If there is an oral lease or rental agreement, the person(s) who
entered into the oral lease or rental agreement with the owner or their agent.
   Failure to comply with this Section (B) C will result in:
      (1)   Notification (sent by regular U.S. mail delivery) to landlord and
requiring compliance within 30 days.
      (2)   Subpoena (sent by certified mail) for the property owner or agent
to appear before the Tax Administrator with required documentation (with
hearing scheduled within 14 days of date mailed).
      (3)   Prohibition. No person shall knowingly fail, refuse, or neglect to
file any return or report required under this Chapter or under rules and
regulations made under authority thereof; or file or knowingly cause to be
filed any incomplete, false or fraudulent return, report or statement; or
knowingly fail, refuse, or neglect to withhold or remit any City tax; or
knowingly fail, refuse, or neglect to pay any City tax, penalty or interest; or
aid or abet another in the filing of any incomplete, false or fraudulent
return, report or statement.
      (4)   Penalty. Any person who violates this Section (B) is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the 1st degree, and in addition to other penalties provided by
law, shall be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprisoned not more than six (6)
months, or both. (Ord. 006-18. Passed 4-2-18.)
   194.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
   (C)    The Finance Director, or his duly authorized agent or employee in the
Department of Taxation, is authorized to examine the books, papers and records
of any employer, taxpayer or person subject to the provisions of this chapter,
or of any employer, taxpayer or person he reasonably believes to be subject to
the provisions of this chapter, for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made, or, if no return was made, to ascertain the City tax due.
Every employer, supposed employer, taxpayer and supposed taxpayer shall furnish
the Finance Director, or his duly authorized agent or employee in the
Department of Taxation, within thirty (30) days following a written request by
the Finance Director, or his duly authorized agent or employee in the
Department of Taxation, the means, facilities and opportunity for making such
examination and investigation as hereby authorized.
   (D) The Finance Director, or his duly authorized agent or employee in the
Department of Taxation, is authorized to examine any person, employer, or
taxpayer under oath concerning any compensation or net profits which were or
should have been returned for taxation or any City tax which was or should have
been withheld or paid, and for this purpose, may compel by subpoena or
otherwise the production of books, papers, records and federal and state income
tax returns and records and the attendance of all persons before him, whether
as parties or witnesses, whenever he believes such persons have knowledge of
such compensation, net profits, information or documentation.
   (E) All returns, investigations, examinations and hearings, and all
information and documentation produced therewith, and all information and
documentation gained as a result thereof are confidential except for official
purposes and except in accordance with proper judicial order and shall be
carefully preserved so that they shall not be available for inspection by or
dissemination to anyone other than the proper officers, agents and employees of
the City for official purposes. Any person disclosing any such information or
documentation is guilty of a misdemeanor of the 1st degree. Each disclosure
shall constitute a separate offense. In addition to the above penalties, any
officer, agent or employee of the City who violates any provision of this
chapter relative to disclosures of confidential information shall be dismissed
immediately from the service of the City.
(Ord. 053-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   194.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 053-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   194.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
    (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
194.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 053-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   194.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
(60) days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the
Tax Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
(60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 053-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   194.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the
Municipality. Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five (5) years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the Municipality (City Manager). This member
may be an employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance
or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
         (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty (60) days of when the vacancy was
created. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the
expiration of the term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall
hold office for the remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall
impair the power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the
powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)    No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)    A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen (15) days after issuing the
final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the
board's final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 053-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   194.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
194.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three (3) years
after the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud,
failure to file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of
income required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years
after the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
194.096 of this Chapter.
   
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
194.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
194.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division

excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (B)(1) of
section
194.306 of the Codified Ordinances.

      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City of
Napoleon as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the City of Napoleon only if, regardless of where title passes,
the property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the City of
Napoleon from a stock of goods located within the City of Napoleon.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the City of Napoleon from a
location outside the City of Napoleon, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within the City of Napoleon and the sales result from such solicitation or
promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City of Napoleon to the extent that such services are performed in the City of
Napoleon.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the City of Napoleon shall be sitused to the City of
Napoleon.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City of Napoleon shall be sitused
to the City of Napoleon.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City of Napoleon based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the City of Napoleon.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City of
Napoleon in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real
estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the City of Napoleon based upon
the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate located in the City of Napoleon to the
commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A) of section
194.03 of the Codified Ordinances by the City or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to the City of Napoleon. In no case shall a
taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the City
of Napoleon any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City of Napoleon
under this section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

prescribed by the commissioner and shall include any information that forms the
basis for the referral.
      (2)    If the tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the tax administrator under this section, the City reserves its right to pursue
any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the correct
tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
         (Ord. 005-18. Passed 2-19-18.)
194.304 FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)    For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual

on a form and in the manner prescribed by the commissioner, on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable

      (2)    If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one
calendar year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to

194.306 of the Codified Ordinances onto its annual return.

information.
         (b)    A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission
is not available, mail the documents to the tax commissioner. The department of
taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the tax commissioner may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal income tax.
   (D)   (1)   (a)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with section
194.011 of the Codified Ordinances, the commissioner may require taxpayers to
file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this section,
including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (E)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,

the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (F)    When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature. (Ord.
005-18. Passed 2-19-18.)
194.305 ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (A)    All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under section
 194.30 of the Codified Ordinances shall file any tax return or extension for

manner as prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)    A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the

   (C)    The tax commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)    The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns

194.306 CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section
194.30 of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (B)(1) or (2) of section
194.063 of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under section
194.30 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
194.301 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section
194.301 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
194.302 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
 194.302 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in section
194.302 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
194.30 to
 194.315 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits
that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of
the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
194.302 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit
from" appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of
corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under section
194.30 to
194.315 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. 005-18. Passed 2-19-18.)
194.307 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.

194.30 of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
sections
194.30 to
194.315 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before
the date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under section
 194.310 of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 005-18. Passed 2-19-18.)
194.308 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:

income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;

and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections
194.30 to
194.315 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 005-18. Passed 2-19-18.)
194.309 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.

 194.315 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the

commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding

instance, under this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections
 194.30 to

sections
194.30 to
194.315 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections
194.30 to
194.315 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
194.30 to
194.315 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
section
 194.311 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
section
194.310 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for
the assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
194.30 to
194.315 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 005-18. Passed 2-19-18.)
194.310  ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
194.30 to
194.315 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section
194.311 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by sections
194.30 to
194.315 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section
194.311 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section. (Ord. 005-18. Passed 2-19-18.)
194.311  REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
194.30 to
194.315 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of section
194.310 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 005-18. Passed 2-19-18.)
194.312 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
194.30 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
sections
194.30 to
194.315 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
194.310 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
194.311 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to
the requirements of that section. An application filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the
time prescribed in section
 194.311 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 005-18. Passed 2-19-18.)
194.313 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
194.30 to
194.315 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
194.30 to
 194.315 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 005-18. Passed 2-19-18.)
194.314  CREDITS.

amount of the credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the tax year to
which the credit is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the City of Napoleon and taxpayer under section
 194.081 or
194.082 of the Codified Ordinances, or to modify the terms or conditions of any
such existing agreement.

   (A)   This Chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of

continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the

194.19.

(Ord. 053-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   194.98 SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this Chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the

any vote.
If any member, in speaking or otherwise, transgresses the rules of the
commission, the presiding officer shall call the offending member to order. The
member so called to order shall refrain from further speaking unless permitted
by the presiding officer to explain. Any member may, by raising the point of

debate shall be in order. All motions which have been entertained by the
presiding officer shall be entered upon the minutes.

move for reconsideration of any action at the same or the next succeeding
meeting provided, however, that a commission resolution authorizing or relating
to any contract may be reconsidered at any time before the final execution
thereof. A motion to reconsider shall require a majority vote of all current

The commission may, by entering into executive session, exclude members of the
public and staff from a portion of a public meeting to discuss matters as
stated below and other matters as authorized by law. Only members of the public
body, its invited staff and invited guests may attend. The commission or any
given committee shall not exclude any of its members from an executive session.
      1)   To consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion, or compensation of a public employee or official or (to
consider) the investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee,
official, licensee, or regulated individual, unless the employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual request a public hearing; however, this
provision does not allow the public body to consider the discipline of an
elected official for conduct related to the performance of the person's
official duties or to consider the person's removal from office.
      2)   To consider the purchase of property (real or personal property,
whether it is tangible or intangible). Also, to consider the sale of property
by competitive bid (real or personal property) if disclosure of the information
would result in a competitive advantage to the other side. No member may use
this exception as subterfuge for providing covert information to prospective
buyers or sellers.
      3)   To discuss pending or imminent court action with the commission's
attorney. Court action is pending if a lawsuit has been commences; court action
is imminent if it is on the point of happening or is impending.
   
      4)   To discuss matters required to be kept confidential by federal law,
federal rules, or state statutes; or as otherwise determined by ordinance or
resolution declaring the necessity of confidentiality.
      5)   To discuss specialized details of security arrangements where

No decision-making (formal action including actual voting) is permitted in
executive session. Further, intertwined non-excepted matters are prohibited
from discussion while in executive session. Minutes shall not be taken in
executive session.
An executive session must always begin and end in open session. First there
shall be a motion that states the purpose for the executive session, and the
motion must be specific as to the matters to be discussed (i.e. to discuss the
dismissal of a public employee), it is not sufficient to state "personnel".
Second, after the motion, there must be a second and a roll call vote taken,
with a majority of a quorum of the public body. The vote shall be recorded in
the minutes. When the executive session has concluded, a motion and second
should be received with a roll call vote taken to adjourn the executive
session. It should be reported if any action or no action was taken. The
adjournment and reporting of action or no action shall be recorded in the
minutes.
Rule 2.26   Joint Sessions Of Committees, Boards, Commissions
Notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter 121 of the Ohio Revised Code, council
members, committee members, board members or commission members may attend
meetings of each other; however, if attended for the purpose of a prearranged
discussion of the public business by a majority of its members, it should be
published as a joint session and called and conducted as such. Both bodies
should call their respective body to order and have minutes taken and prepared
for each. Visiting members of bodies, other than that body scheduled for an
official session, may attend; however, if a quorum of the visiting body should
happen to formulate, then those visiting attendees shall be mere passive
observers in a ministerial fact gathering capacity or informational session.
Rule 2.27   Conflict In Rules Governing Meetings And Hearings

writing, no later than forty-eight (48) hours prior to the examination that
such assistance will be required. Any such assistance shall be limited to
reading the examination and/or marking the answers as directed by the
applicants. Any outside assistants shall be approved and/or provided by the
commission.

papers and inform himself or herself as to the markings given him or her on
each subject or question and to submit in writing for the commission's
consideration, any objection or protest he or she may wish to make concerning
the grades given him or her. No objection or protest concerning an examination,
not submitted in writing, shall be considered unless it relates to the conduct
of examiners, the securing of unlawful assistance by a competitor or such other
circumstances in connection with an examination as would call for an
investigation on the part of the commission, and which would require that the
information submitted be given in confidence. An applicant who exercises the
right to inspect his or her examination papers shall not be permitted to again
take an examination for the same classification within a six (6) month period
following the inspection, unless an alternate form of examination is given.
Inspection shall not be permitted of standardized tests prepared by experts
outside the city service, where such inspection would tend to reduce the
validity of test results.
 
Rule 4.12   Examinations Postponed

order shall designate the reason therefor. Reasonable efforts shall be made to

the sole discretion of the commission.
 
Rule 4.13   Educational Prerequisites - Educational Credit

being created, shall not be a part of, but shall be a credit to be added to the
person's base earned grade given in the regular examination in which the person
receives a passing grade resulting from the competitive examination for
original appointment to positions under the jurisdiction of the commission
where the commission has elected to grant such credit. The commission may grant
such credit in an amount and under conditions deemed appropriate by the
commission when determining fitness and merit; provided, that such amount is
established in advance of any affected examination; and provided, that no such
credit shall be added to a person's examination grade unless the applicant
achieves at least the minimum passing grade as established in Rule 4.17 on the
examination without counting any additional credit; moreover, in order to be
eligible to receive the credit, the applicant must submit proof of such
education at the time of filing the application. Any additional credit given

grade given in the applicant's regular examination, unless otherwise method is
authorized by the commission.
 
Rule 4.14   Release Time For Examinations
 
City employees shall be allowed necessary time off without loss of pay to
compete in any civil service examination conducted by the commission for the
classification in which the employee is serving as a provisional. The

guard or a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States who has
completed more than one hundred eighty days (180) of active duty service
pursuant to an executive order of the President of the United States or an act

the United States shall not be a part of but shall be a credit to be added to
the applicant's base earned grade resulting from the competitive examination
for original appointment to positions under the commission's jurisdiction where
the commission has elected to grant such credit. The commission may grant
veteran's service credit in an amount and under conditions deemed appropriate

Except as otherwise provided in Rule 9.5.2(1) of these rules and procedures, in
promotional examinations, no additional credit for seniority or efficiency in
the civil service of the city, the state, or any other political subdivision of

construed as limiting the commission's ability to use seniority as a tie
breaker.
 
      Rule 4.15.3 Political or Religious Questions Prohibited.
      No questions in any examination shall relate to political or religious
opinions or affiliations.
      (Ord. 017-18. Passed 4-16-18.)

proficiency of each competitor determined on the basis of a scale of one
hundred (100%) percent for maximum possible attainment.
      2)   Each part shall be assigned a weight which shall be based on the
relative value of the part to that of the entire examination expressed in terms
of tenth (1-10th) of the total.

examination for original appointment to the position of Police Officer shall be

to the date of the original examination for Police Officer, the commission will
accept that certification for the physical agility portion of the original
examination for Police Officer.
      The physical agility portion of the original examination for Firefighter/
Paramedic will be administered by the National Testing Network using the
standard of the Firefighter's Mile. The commission will accept the Firefighter
Mile card for the physical agility portion of the original examination for
Firefighter/Paramedic.

authorized examiners; provided that the commission may correct clerical errors
of examiners or employees at any time before the cancellation of such lists.
 
Rule 4.19   Repeating Examinations
 
An applicant who has competed in a civil service examination may not repeat
that examination or take an examination for the same classification within six
(6) months from the date of original examination, unless an alternative form of
examination is given, or unless other standards are specified in the
examination announcement, provided that the commission may waive in writing
this rule upon written request from an applicant stating substantial reasons
for granting such waiver.   
 
Rule 4.20   Preservation Of Examination Papers
 
Applications and final scores of all candidates for employment in the
classified service shall be secured on file in the office of the finance

the State of Ohio or signify in writing his or her intention to become and

statute or rule.
Rule 5.2   Citizenship Required
Every applicant for examination in the police and fire division must be a U.S.
Citizen at the time of application or must have legally declared their

the age limits, if any, fixed by the commission in the examination
announcement.

Application blanks for examinations shall be furnished by the commission. On
the application blank the applicant shall state his or her name, address, and
other such information as may reasonably be required concerning his or her
education, experience, health, physical and mental capacity. The commission may
determine and provide for the submission of any other relevant information
either on the application blank or supplemental sheet. No inquiry shall be made
as to the religious or political affiliations, nor as to the racial or ethnic
origin of the applicant.
Rule 5.5   Character And Fitness Of Applicant
Satisfactory information produced at any time to the commission, either before

public service, or of his or her conviction of a felony, or has a pattern of
poor work habits and performance with previous employers, or has made a false
statement of a material fact, or uses illegal drugs, or has attempted to commit
deception or fraud on application or examination, shall be sufficient to
exclude him or her from examination, or to remove his or her name from any
eligible list, providing such person shall be notified as to the reason and

examination announcement must appear on the application itself. No additional
information will be accepted after the filing deadline.
Failure of an applicant to indicate on his or her application the
qualifications as to experience or any other requirements described in the
bulletin announcing the examination will be considered sufficient cause to
exclude an applicant from the examination. At the discretion of the commission,
a defective or incomplete application may be corrected by the applicant and
resubmitted by the filing deadline. (Ord. 62-05. Passed 6-20-05.)
   195.06 RULE 6 ELIGIBLE LIST.
Rule 6.1   Creation and Posting Of Lists
The commission shall hold examinations at times deemed appropriate by the
commission in order to maintain adequate certified eligible lists. The
commission shall prepare and keep open to public inspection, from the returns
of each examination, an eligible list of all persons whose average grade in the
examination is not less than the minimum passing grade as established in Rule
4.17 and who are otherwise eligible for appointment, including those persons
that would be eligible except for not meeting a specific certification
requirement for appointment to a position as was approved prior to the
examination by the commission. Such eligible list shall be certified by the
commission to the appointing authority as a standing certified list until
otherwise modified or terminated by the commission or by operation of rule or
law.
 
Such persons shall take rank upon the eligible list in the order of their
relative grades. Whenever it becomes necessary to hold a subsequent examination
in order to obtain additional eligibles, the commission may consolidate
existing lists for the same class by arranging the names of those eligible
therein according to their grade. All those persons whose names appear on an
existing list which is to be merged with a new list shall have an opportunity
to compete in all subsequent examinations held with intention of merger, unless
the person is disqualified pursuant to Rule
6.6.
Rule 6.2   Creation Of List While Other Lists Exists
When for any reason the commission shall hold an examination to create an
eligible list for any classification while there are eligibles on any existing
list for such classification and any person on such existing list takes such
examination, he or she shall be given the standing on such combined list to
which the higher grade received in either examination shall entitle him or her
during the continuance of the first list, and thereafter he or she shall take
rank in accordance with the grade received in the subsequent examination.
Rule 6.3   Duration Of Lists
The term of eligibility of each list and of the names appearing thereon shall
be fixed by the commission at not less than one (1) year, nor more than two (2)
years. Any list that has been in effect for more than one (1) year may, at the
discretion of the commission, be terminated at any time in the public interest,
provided, however, that every list shall expire after being in existence for
two (2) years.
Rule 6.4   Ranking Of Applicants: Identical Grades
In the event two (2) or more applicants receive the same mark in open
competitive examination, priority in the time of filing application with the
commission shall determine the order in which their names shall be placed on
the eligible list; provided, that applicants eligible for veteran's preference
shall receive priority in rank on the eligible list over non-veterans on the
list with a rating equal to that of the veteran. Ties among veterans shall be
decided by priority of filing application. For the purpose of this rule,
veteran shall include those persons eligible to receive credit under Rule
4.15.1.
Rule 6.5   Separate Lists For Police And Fire
Separate eligible lists shall be maintained for original and promotional
appointments in police and fire departments. No person may be transferred from
one (1) list to the other, and appointments and promotions shall be made only
from the eligible lists maintained for each department.
Rule 6.6   Removal From Eligible List and Disqualification
If at any time after the creation of an eligible list, the commission has
reason to believe that any person whose name appears on such list has in any
manner become disqualified for appointment because of incapacity developed
subsequent to his or her examination, because of false statements made in his
or her application, for failure to communicate with the commission or
appointing authority, or for other just and reasonable cause as determined by
the commission, such person shall be notified by regular U.S. mail, with proof
of mailing required to his or her last address on file with the commission, and
given an opportunity to be heard. If such person should fail to appear for such
hearing, or it be established at such hearing that such eligible is
disqualified or incapacitated for appointment, his or her name shall be removed
from the eligible list by the commission. Notwithstanding what has been stated
herein, a person that accepts appointment from an eligible list is thereafter
deemed automatically removed from the list without further action of the
commission.
 
Names may be removed from an eligible list by action of the commission for the
following reasons in addition to those heretofore considered:
 
      1)   Failure to report or arrange for an interview with the appointing
authority within six (6) business days after a notice to do so sent by the
commission or appointing authority to the applicant's address as set forth on
the application blank;
      2)   Failure to respond to any notice by regular U.S. mail, with proof of
mailing required to his or her last address on file with the commission, from
the commission or the appointing authority within six (6) business days of the
date of mailing of said notice;
 
      3)   Request of the eligible;
 
      4)   Failure to accept appointment upon certification;
Rule 6.7   Change Of Address
Each person on an eligible list shall file with the commission written notice
of any change of address within six (6) business days of such address change,
and failure to do so may be considered sufficient reason for not certifying his
or her name to the appointing authority for future appointments.
Rule 6.8   Re-Examinations: Revocation Of Lists
Whenever in the judgment of the commission action is deemed advisable on
account of errors or fraud in connection with any examination, a re-examination
of applicants shall be ordered and the eligible list shall be amended in
accordance with results of such re-examination. After an eligible list is
prepared and posted it shall not be revoked except upon written notice by
regular U.S. mail, with proof of mailing required to his or her last address on
file with the commission, to all the eligibles.
An appointment made from an eligible list shall be considered valid even if
fraud or error is discovered after the appointment has been made provided the
person appointed was not involved in such fraud or error.
All applicants in the first examination shall be notified and shall be eligible
to compete in the rescheduled examination without filing a separate application

grade) in the police department or above the rank of firefighter/paramedic in

first passed a competitive promotional examination administered or caused to be
administered by the Civil Service commission. Promotion in the police
department shall be by successive ranks so far as practicable, and no person in
the police department shall test or be promoted to a position in a higher rank
unless such person meets the following criteria: for rank above that of police
officer (patrolman grade), but below the rank of Chief or Assistant Chief, the
person shall possess a two (2) year college degree from an accredited college
in any discipline or have an equivalent of one hundred fifty (150) clock hours

enforcement or other related field. Promotion in the fire/rescue department
shall be by successive ranks so far as practicable, and no person in the fire/
rescue department shall test or be promoted to a position in a higher rank who
has not served at least three (3) years of cumulative service as a full-time
firefighter/paramedic within the State of Ohio (which in the case of other
political subdivisions means a firefighter or a firefighter who is also a
paramedic) and has completed their probationary period in the rank they
currently hold within the city fire/rescue department. For the rank of Chief in
the fire rescue department, the person shall possess at least a two (2) year
degree from an accredited college in any discipline and at least three (3)
years cumulative service as a full-time firefighter and paramedic. No
competitive promotional examination shall be held unless there are at least two
(2) persons eligible to compete. Whenever the Civil Service commission
determines that there are less than two (2) persons holding positions in the
rank next lower than the position to be filled, who are eligible and willing to
compete, such commission shall allow persons holding positions in the rank
lower than the next lower rank for the positions to be filled to compete.
 
      1)   Whenever a vacancy occurs in a position above the rank of police
officer (patrolman grade) in the police department or above the rank of
firefighter in the fire/rescue department and an eligible list exists as to the
respective department, the Civil Service commission shall forthwith, upon the
request of the appointing authority, certify to the appointing authority the
names of the persons receiving the three (3) highest scores, who successfully
passed the test. Upon such certification, the appointing authority shall
promote one (1) of the persons so certified within thirty (30) days from the
date of such certification.
 
      2)   Whenever a vacancy occurs in a position above the rank of police
officer in the police department or above the rank of firefighter/paramedic in
the fire/rescue department and an eligible list does not exist as to the
respective department, the said commission shall upon request of the appointing
authority, within sixty (60) days of such vacancy, hold, or cause to be held, a
competitive promotional examination. After such examination has been held, and
an eligible list established, the said commission shall forthwith, upon the
request of the appointing authority, certify to the appointing authority the
names of the persons receiving the three (3) highest scores, who successfully
completed the test. Upon such certification, the appointing authority shall
promote one (1) of the persons so certified within thirty (30) days from the
date of certification.
 
      3)   The rule of three (3) (submitting three (3) names of the persons
receiving the highest scores and who successfully completed the test) shall be
complied with when practical; however, if at anytime there are less than three
(3) names certifiable on an eligible list, the commission may certify all names
(less than three (3) names) to the appointing authority at which time the
appointing authority shall promote one (1) of such persons within thirty (30)
days from the date of certification.
 
      4)    If more than one (1) vacancy is to be filled, the number of names
to be certified shall be determined in the following manner when practical: For

      5)   Any person promoted pursuant to this Rule
9.5.1 shall receive a conditional promotion and shall also be placed on
probation, both for a period not to exceed one year, conditioned upon the
continued need of the position and/or conditioned upon satisfactory performance
in the promoted position and such person may be demoted at anytime within that
one (1) year period by the appointing authority, subject to appeal to the Civil
Service Commission. Civil Service review for the purpose of this Rule shall be
limited to whether or not the appointing authority abused its discretion.
 
Rule 9.5.2   Promotion or Appointment of a Chief Within the Police or Within
the Fire/Rescue Department
 
1)   The appointment of chief of the police department or chief of the fire/
rescue department shall be considered first a promotion and shall follow the
procedures in Rule 9.5.1; however, if no names are certified upon one attempt
for the current vacancy or if the names certified decline the promotion, then
the appointment shall be considered an original appointment. In the event that
Council adopts an ordinance or resolution providing for the appointment of a
chief regardless of prior service with the city and without regard to any time-
in-rank requirements that might otherwise restrict the field of candidates to
initially hiring only from within the city as a promotion, then such provisions
shall apply, no extra credit for seniority or efficiency shall be added to the
score of any candidate for either of those two (2) positions, without approval
of Council by ordinance or resolution passed prior to the examination, as that
would disadvantage qualified persons who have not previously been employed by
the City, and the position shall otherwise be filled as an original
appointment.
      2)   When a vacancy exists for chief of the police or chief of the fire/
rescue department, and such position is not filled by promotion, nor has the
Civil Service Commission suspended the provisions for competitive civil service
examination in an exceptional situation as described in Rule
8.3, then the vacancy shall be filled as an original appointment utilizing the
same rules and procedures established by the Civil Service Commission as to
other original appointments in the police or fire/rescue departments, except
that applicants may be limited in amount as determined reasonable by the
Commission who are deemed qualified by the Civil Service Commission to take the
exam. Any limitation in number of applicants shall be determined prior to
posting of the notice of testing. Examinations for the positions of chief of
the police and chief of the fire/rescue departments may include written
examination, oral examination, performance examination, evaluation of
experience, practical demonstrations of skills, and/or such other forms of
examination as the Civil Service Commission deems appropriate. Qualifications
shall include, but not be limited to those applicants having the qualifications
as specified by the job description. When the vacancy is not filled by
promotion, then the appointing authority, within thirty (30) days after the
Civil Service Commission notifies the appointing authority that no names can be
certified or that all those persons certified as eligible have declined
appointment, may modify the job description and file the same with the Civil
Service Commission, except that the educational experience shall be that as
established by the Civil Service Commission. Further, although not to be
considered part of the civil service exam, the appointing authority may, but is
not required, to use an independent technical assessment board to assist
selection of the final appointee from the names certified by the said
commission; such board shall recommend only as to this original appointment.
      3)   In the case of original appointment, any city employee who is
properly qualified as an applicant may take the exam; so long as the person is
within the established number of applicants deemed qualified, even though such
employee may have previously tested for the position. If such employee is
successful for appointment, such employee shall be considered a new employee
and must resign his/her current position prior to appointment. If such employee
is a member of the respective department that he or she is testing and receives
the appointment, it shall not be considered a break in service for the purpose
of retirement, certification, vacation, sick leave, and longevity if
applicable, to the new position.
      4)   Any person promoted or appointed to chief pursuant to this Rule
9.5.2 shall receive a conditional promotion or appointment, whichever is
applicable, and shall be placed on probation, both for a period not to exceed
one (1) year, conditioned upon the continued need of the position and/or
conditioned upon satisfactory performance in the promoted or appointed
position. Such person may be demoted (if the position was filled by promotion)
or demoted or terminated (if the position was filled by original appointment)
at anytime within that one (1) year period by the appointing authority, subject
to appeal to the Civil Service Commission. Civil service review for the purpose
of this section shall be limited to whether or not the appointing authority
abused its discretion.

provided the employee receives a copy of the amended order prior to ten (10)
calendar days before the time set for the hearing as herein provided. The ten
(10) calendar day requirement may be waived by the Commission.
Material not originally present in an "order" may, at any other time, at the
discretion of the commission, be added to the order after it is furnished to
the employee or filed with the commission. The Commission shall freely allow
after acquired evidence to be added to the order at any time. Material may be
deleted from an " order" at any time, at the discretion of the commission.
      1)   Such added material, may be made the basis of a subsequent order.
      2)   An appointing authority or their designee may correct errors at any
time.
      3)   Upon written notice to the employee, an appointing authority or
their designee may withdraw an "order" at any time.
Rule 14.6   Laches
Employees shall not be disciplined for acts which have been known or should
have been known to the appointing authority more than two (2) years prior to
the issuance of an "order."
      1)   Whether an appointing authority knew or should have known of the
occurrence of events giving rise to disciplinary action is a question of fact
to be determined by the commission.
      2)   The length of time between the occurrence of the action, the
appointing authority's knowledge of the incident, and the imposition of
discipline will be factors in the commission's determination of the
appropriateness of the disciplinary action.
This rule does not bar discipline based upon a criminal conviction, less than
two (2) years old, even though the incidents giving rise to such conviction
occurred more than two (2) years prior to the imposition of discipline;
moreover, this rule does not bar discipline when complicity to a criminal act
exists by a person of higher authority to the employee.
Rule 14.7   Merger And Bar
All incidents, which occurred prior to the incident for which a non-oral
disciplinary action is being imposed of which an appointing authority has
knowledge and for which an employee could be disciplined, are merged into the
non-oral discipline imposed by the appointing authority. Incidents occurring
after the incident for which a non-oral disciplinary action is being imposed,
but prior to the issuance of the non-oral disciplinary order, are not merged
and may form the basis for subsequent discipline.
      1)   For purposes of this rule, knowledge of an appointing authority will
include knowledge of those persons with authority to impose non-oral discipline
for the appointing authority, except when those persons of higher authority to
the employee are in complicity with the employee in committing a violation for
which non-oral discipline may be imposed.
      2)   For purposes of this rule, non-oral discipline includes written
reprimands and suspension orders. It does not include a written memorandum of
oral counseling or written warnings.
Once discipline is imposed for a particular incident, that incident shall not
be used as the basis for subsequent discipline, but may be used for purpose of
demotion and/or dismissal.
Rule 14.8   Appointing Authority's Burden Of Proof And Scope Of Hearing
The appointing authority shall prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the
factual allegations in a disciplinary order. Failure to prove all of the
allegations contained in an order does not, as a matter of law, require
disaffirmance of an order.
The commission shall expressly confine itself to the following issues:
      1)   Whether or not there was a proper order issued (i.e., compliance
with the requirements of Section
14.3 of these rules); and,
      2)   Whether or not the allegation or allegations were proven by a
preponderance of the evidence; and,
      3)   Whether or not the discipline action that was imposed by the
appointing authority was appropriate.
The commission is empowered to and shall affirm or disaffirm an order. The
commission is also empowered to reduce any discipline action that was imposed
by the appointing authority, and may do so, when one of the following findings
are made by the commission, that
      1)   The appointing authority at the time of making the order acted in an
arbitrary or capricious manner when imposing the discipline.
      2)   The appointing authority at the time of making the order abused its
discretion when imposing the discipline.
      3)   Disparity of treatment exists between similarly situated employees,
with similar work records, for similar type misconduct which resulted in the
disciplinary action and that in the public’s best interest, a reduced
disciplinary action is appropriate.
      4)   The evidence as was presented to the Commission by the parties
during the appeal was such that, in the best interest of public service, a
reduced disciplinary action is appropriate.
         An appellant is not entitled to back pay or benefits as a result of an
order of suspension or termination by the appointing authority, unless the
commission finds, based on preponderance of the evidence as proven by the
appellant, that criteria 1 or 2 occurred.
The commission may find that the appointing authority "substantially complied"
with the procedural requirements for issuing discipline, preparing and serving
the order, serving the employee, etc., when the commission determines that the
employee was not materially prejudiced.
Rule 14.9   Contents Of Appeals
All appeals to the commission shall be in writing. Notices of appeal shall
include the following information:
      1)   The appellant's name, address, and telephone number; and,
      2)   The name, address, and telephone number of the appointing authority;
and,
      3)   A description or summary of the action which is being appealed.
Appellants shall notify the commission, in writing, of any change of address
during the pendency of an appeal.
Rule 14.10   Suspensions, Demotions, Reductions, And Dismissals Without An
Order
If a disciplinary suspension, demotion or dismissal is alleged and no "order"
has been filed with the commission, the employee shall prove, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the disciplinary suspension, demotion or
dismissal occurred.
Rule 14.11   Investigations
Investigations may, at the discretion of the commission, be conducted by an
exchange of correspondence between the commission and the parties. Unless a
party can show good cause for its failure to respond, decisions will be based
on the information received within the response time allowed. In the
commission's discretion, investigations may be set for hearing.
Upon completion of an investigation, the commission may order the correction of
a violation.
Rule 14.12   Rules Of Evidence
All hearings conducted pursuant to these Rules and Procedures shall be
administrative in nature and the commission shall not be bound by formal rules
of evidence or procedure. The strict rules of evidence do not apply to hearings
before the commission.  Evidence that is admissible in a hearing before the
Commission is defined as follows: (1) Reliable evidence is dependable; that is,
it can be confidently trusted. In order to be reliable, there must be a
reasonable probability that the evidence is true. (2) Probative evidence is
evidence that tends to prove the issue in question; it must be relevant in
determining the issue. (3) Substantial evidence is evidence with some weight;
it must have importance and value. Furthermore, hearsay is admissible in the
civil service proceeding.
Rule 14.13   Prior Disciplinary Action
Evidence of prior disciplinary action is inadmissible to prove the existence of
any incident alleged in an "order."
For purposes of this rule, prior disciplinary action consists only of those
written reprimands, suspensions, or dismissals contained in the employee's
personnel file.
The commission may admit evidence of prior discipline if it is offered to prove
either:
      1)   Notice to an employee that particular conduct is unacceptable; or,
      2)   A continuing problem justifying harsher discipline than might
otherwise have been imposed.
Rule 14.14   Questionnaires
At any time prior to a hearing, the commission may order evidence taken in the
form of questionnaires.
The commission may require questionnaires to be submitted at a hearing or to be
returned by mail.
      1)   Questionnaires shall be treated as admissions and may be completed
with the advice of a party's representative.
      2)   All questionnaires shall bear the oath or affirmation of the party
completing them.
Questionnaires may be used as the sole basis for deciding any appeal. Failure
to respond to a questionnaire may result in dismissal of the case.
Rule 14.15   Witnesses
All witnesses at any hearing before the commission shall be placed under oath
and shall testify under oath or affirmation.
A witness may be accompanied and advised by legal counsel. Participation by
counsel is limited to protection of his or her client's rights. Counsel for a
non-party witness may neither examine nor cross-examine any witness, without
the prior consent of the commission.
Should a witness refuse to answer a question ruled proper at a hearing or
disobey a subpoena, the commission may initiate contempt proceedings.
Rule 14.16   Conviction Of A Crime
The following paragraphs apply to crimes and criminal conduct other than
felonies within the meaning of O.R.C. 124.34, as such felonies do not allow an
appeal to the commission.
Conviction of any crime in a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive
evidence of the existence of all of the elements of that crime. The mere
conviction of any crime is not conclusive evidence that disciplinary action
based upon the conviction is appropriate, unless the committing of the crime is
the alleged violation.
A conviction can be established only through certified copies of the original
journal entry from the court in which the conviction was obtained.
Evidence of conviction of a crime is inadmissible unless a connection is
established between the crime and the particulars alleged in a disciplinary
order.
Indictment for or allegation of a criminal offense does not in itself establish
a statutory basis for discipline; however, when coupled with a factual basis in
considering the evidence, may be a cause for discipline.
Rule 14.17   Best Evidence
A duplicate may be admitted to prove the content of a document, recording, or
photograph unless:
      1)    A genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the
original; or
      2)   The commission determines it would be unfair to admit the duplicate
in lieu of the original.
Rule 14.18   Administrative Notice
At any time prior to the issuance of a final order, the commission may take
notice of the contents of any classification specification.
This rule does not limit the commission's authority to take notice at a hearing
of any fact, including the contents of any personnel file maintained by the
commission.
Rule 14.19   Disparate Treatment
The commission may hear evidence of disparate treatment between the appellant
and other employees of the appointing authority for the purpose of determining
whether work rules or administrative policies are being selectively applied by
the appointing authority or to determine whether the discipline of similarly
situated employees is uniform. Requests for discovery under this rule shall be
limited to information relating to specific incidents or persons known to the
employee or his or her representative.
Evidence of disparate treatment may be considered in evaluating the
appropriateness of the discipline which was imposed. (See Rule
14.8)
Rule 14.20   Designation Of Parties
The party filing an appeal is designated "appellant." The other party is
designated "appellee".
Rule 14.21   Notice Of Hearings
Scheduling notices shall be mailed to the parties and their representatives by
regular U.S. mail, with proof of mailing required to his or her last address on
file with the commission, at least thirty (30) calendar days in advance of the
hearing.
Rule 14.22   Continuances
Upon its own motion or upon the motion of any party, the commission may
continue a hearing.
      1)   Requests for continuance shall be addressed to the Clerk of the
commission being the City Finance Director (or Council Clerk when one exists).
A request for continuance will not automatically stay the hearing, but must be
expressly granted.
      2)   Requests for continuance shall be made, in writing, at least ten
(10) calendar days prior to a scheduled hearing date, unless good cause is
shown for failing to do so. Exceptions to this rule may be made at the
discretion of the commission. If a party requests a continuance less than ten
(10) calendar days prior to hearing, then that party shall inform the
commission of the opposing party's consent or opposition to the continuance
request.
      3)   Each party shall contact its subpoenaed witnesses and inform them of
the continuance. Failure to notify the opposing party or opposing party's
counsel of a continuance which has been granted may be treated as a failure to
appear by the party requesting the continuance if the opposing side appears for
the hearing.
      4)   The commission will not again issue subpoenas when a hearing has
been continued unless specifically requested to do so in writing.
Absent compelling circumstances, hearings shall not be continued due to the
unavailability of a subpoenaed witness. The commission may hold the record open
or accept a testimonial deposition. The cost of testimonial depositions taken
under this rule shall be borne by the requesting party.
Rule 14.23   Consolidations
If two (2) or more appeals involve substantially identical issues of fact and
law, the commission may consolidate them into a single hearing upon its own
motion or upon the motion of either party.
Rule 14.24   Appearances
Any person, unless prohibited by law, may represent himself or herself. An
employee may be represented by an Attorney. The commission may allow
representation by a person not an attorney so long as the person does not
receive any compensation from the employee for such representation.
Provided a party has not been subpoenaed and has authorized his or her
representative to represent him or her in all facets of a hearing before the
commission, that party is not required to appear personally at the hearing.
Representatives shall enter their appearances in writing.
One who has entered an appearance as the representative of a party is that
party's representative of record unless and until a written withdrawal is filed
with the commission.
If more than one (1) person enters an appearance as a party's representative,
communications shall be sent as follows:
      1)   If one of the representatives entering an appearance has been
designated, in writing, to receive communications from the commission, all
communications shall be sent to that representative.
      2)   If no representative has been designated to receive communications
from the commission, all communications shall be sent to the representative who
last entered an appearance.
      3)   If it is impossible to determine who last entered an appearance, all
communications shall be sent to the representative whose name is first in
alphabetical order.
Rule 14.25   Substitution Of Parties
If an appellant dies during the pendency of an appeal, the executor or
administrator of his or her estate shall, upon motion, be substituted for him
or her. An appeal shall be held open for a reasonable time to permit this
substitution.
If the appointing authority changes during the pendency of an appeal, the new
appointing authority is automatically substituted without formal motion or
order.
Rule 14.26   Motions
All motions shall state, with particularity, both the relief sought and the
basis for such relief.
      1)   All motions, and any supporting documentation shall be served on the
opposing party.
      2)   Motions to dismiss an appeal shall be supported by affidavits, made
on personal knowledge, setting forth facts as would be admissible in evidence.
Affidavits shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to
the matters stated therein. Sworn or certified copies of all papers referred to
in an affidavit shall be attached thereto. When a motion is made and supported
as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon mere allegations
or denials. An adverse party's response, by affidavit or otherwise, shall set
forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue in dispute.
Procedural motions, not determinative of the final outcome of an appeal, may be
acted upon at any time after receipt by the commission without awaiting a
response from the opposing party.
Within ten (10) calendar days of service of a non-procedural motion, a party
shall serve a written response on the opposing party and file a copy of that
response with the commission. The commission may rule on any non-procedural
motion once the time to respond has run. Upon motion of the affected party, the
commission may extend the time to reply to a non-procedural motion.
The commission may rule on any non-procedural motion at a record hearing, even
if ten (10) calendar days have not elapsed since service. Provided the time for
response to a non-procedural motion has not run, an oral response may be
presented at the record hearing.
Rule 14.27   Briefs
At any time prior to the issuance of a final order, the commission may require
briefs from the parties. Briefs shall address questions put to the parties by
the commission and shall be filed within the time limits set by the commission.
      1)   The commission may limit both the number of reply briefs and the
time for their preparation and filing.
      2)   If a party fails to submit a brief within the time limit, the
commission may exclude his or her brief from its consideration.
Upon motion, the commission may hold the record open for receipt of briefs.
Rule 14.28   Filing
A document is filed when it is received and time stamped by the office of the
Finance Director (or Council Clerk when one exists) or other designated
officer.
For purposes of calculating the appeal time in a disciplinary action, the
filing date of an "order" is the date the order is time stamped by Finance
Director (or Council Clerk when one exists) or other designated officer.
Either an original or a legible copy of any document required to be served by
these rules shall be filed with the commission not more than five (5) calendar
days after service.
All pleadings to be filed with the commission shall be on eight-and-one-half
inch (8 ") by eleven inch (11") paper.
Rule 14.29   Service
Any document required by these rules to be served upon a party may be served
either personally or by mail. When a party is represented by a representative
who has entered an appearance, service shall be made upon that representative.
Service is complete on the date of mailing or upon the date of personal
transmission of the document.
All motions and briefs shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of
the person submitting the motion or brief.
A motion shall be considered by the commission only if a certificate of service
appears on it. Any statement, signed by either the moving party or the party's
representative, is an acceptable certificate of service so long as it contains
all of the following information:
      1)   Date of service,
      2)   Method by which service was made,
      3)   Address where service was made, and
      4)   Name of the person or authority that was served.
Rule 14.30   Communications To Representatives And Parties
Communications regarding scheduling shall be sent to all parties and their
representatives.
Rule 14.31   Computation And Extension Of Time
The date of occurrence of the event causing time to run is not counted in the
computation of any time limit under these rules. The last day of a time period
is included in the computation of time under these rules. If the last day of a
time period is not a regular business day, then the time period shall extend to
the end of the next regularly scheduled business day.
The commission may extend the time for filing or responding to motions and
briefs.
      1)   Requests for extension of time shall be made, in writing.
      2)   Requests for extension of time in appeals before the commission
shall be directed to the Finance Director (or Council Clerk when one exists) or
designated officer.
Rule 14.32   Procedural Orders
Procedural orders may be issued by the commission at any time prior to the
issuance of a final order.
If a party fails to comply with a procedural order, the commission may dismiss
the appeal or grant other appropriate relief to the opposing party.
Rule 14.33   Procedure in Record Hearings
The commission shall determine the order in which a hearing shall proceed.
The hearing, when conducted by commission members, shall be conducted, when
practical, with all current members of the commission present. When the hearing
is conducted by an appointed hearing officer, the commission members need not
be present; however, in the event commission members are present, the member or
members shall remain quiet during the hearing. At the conclusion of the
hearing, after deliberation, utilizing the report or recommendation of the
appointed hearing officer if a hearing officer is utilized, any decision
regarding the outcome of the appeal by the commission shall be made by a
majority vote of the commission members. The hearing shall be in public unless
waived in writing by the parties prior to the time of the hearing at which time
it may be held in executive session, at the discretion of the commission;
however, any action of the commission must be in public. The commission shall
confine its decision to those things found in Rule
14.8. The standard and any procedural rules adopted by the commission under any
provision or subsection of this Rule
14 or Rule
2.1 supersede any contrary provisions of O.R.C. 124.34.
The commission shall hear the evidence upon the order as filed by the
appointing authority. In the hearing of such appeals, the order of procedure
shall be as follows:
      1)   The appointing authority shall adduce their evidence in support of
the order;
      2)   The employee shall then produce such evidence as the employee may
wish to offer in defense;
      3)   The appointing authority may offer evidence in rebuttal;
      4)   The commission may, in its discretion, hear arguments.
The commission may make inquiry in the matter through evidence presented at the
hearing. The commission may continue the hearings as is necessary and required
to receive all relevant testimony and evidence.
At all hearings conducted pursuant to this Rule, the appointing authority and
the employee may be represented by legal counsel.
Either party may call the opposing party to testify as if on cross-examination.
The commission may require, limit, or eliminate opening statements and closing
arguments.
Copies of exhibits shall be made available to the commission as they are
identified. If the hearing is heard by the full commission, three copies of all
exhibits must be submitted to the commission. Parties shall exchange documents
and exhibits prior to the hearing. Hearings will not be delayed to facilitate
an exchange or review of the exhibits.
In hearings before a hearing officer, parties shall provide the commission one
(1) copy of all exhibits.
The parties are encouraged to discuss stipulations and settlement prior to the
start of a hearing.
All parties, witnesses and attorneys are required to arrive at the designated
location of the hearing at the scheduled hearing time.
Rule 14.34   Record Of Hearings
All record hearings shall be audio recorded unless the commission orders a
stenographic record. The recording by the commission is the official record.
Recordings may be destroyed after:
 
      1)   A final board order has been issued; and
 
      2)   Ninety (90) calendar days have passed from the mailing of notice of
the final order of the commission to the parties; or ninety (90) days after a
transcript has been received by the commission from its official stenographer,
subject to record retention schedules.
 
Any party may tape record or have a stenographer present at the hearing,
provided such recording does not interfere with the hearing.
Rule 14.35   Transcripts/Listening To Recording
When a transcript is requested of the commission after a hearing by the
commission or hearing officer, but before briefs are filed with the commission,
the commission shall transmit a written transcript of each hearing appealed to
a court of common pleas. The cost of the transcript must be paid by the losing
party in the court of common pleas.
Transcripts for a party's own use may be obtained through the Finance Director
(or Council Clerk when one exists) or designated person. The cost of the
transcript is to be paid by the party requesting the transcript. A deposit
shall be first posted with the Finance Director or Council Clerk when one
exists, prior to any transcript being prepared. The deposit shall equal an
estimated amount due for said preparation.
Transcripts must be requested within sixty (60) days following the mailing of
the final order.
Any person may listen to the recording of a hearing. In order to do so, a
person must make prior arrangements with the commission. Under no circumstances
shall any person remove the original recording from the commission's control.
Rule 14.36   Subpoenas and Power of Chairman in Procedural Matters
Any member of the commission shall have the power to administer oaths and
affirmations to witnesses and to take testimony concerning the matter before
the commission.
The commission, through its chairman, or an appointed hearing officer, shall
have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses, and the
production of pertinent documents, records, and other evidence; moreover, the
Commission, through its chairman, or an appointed hearing officer, shall have
the power to issue procedural orders and approve appeal withdrawals, consented
dismissals (with or without settlement agreements). The chairman, or an
appointed hearing officer, shall also have the authority to approve indigent
status related to deposits and other costs associated with an appeal. (See Rule
2.1)
Upon a properly prepared precipe, signed by the requesting party, the
commission shall cause to be issued subpoenas for such persons and documents as
the requesting party deems necessary. The party shall submit a written list of
witnesses and a summary of each witness’s testimony prior to the issuance of
the subpoenas. If a party deems it necessary to subpoena more than five (5)
witnesses, prior approval is required.
The commission shall, upon request of a party to an appeal, supply precipe and
subpoena forms to the requesting parties who are responsible for completing and
serving subpoenas. A subpoena is deemed served when:
It is personally served upon the person by a process server or persons
permitted to serve subpoena under the rules of civil procedure; or
It is received by the person at the person's last known address by certified
mail, return receipt requested; or
It is left at the usual place of residence, or last known address of the
person, with an adult residing therein by a process server or persons permitted
to serve subpoena under the rules of civil procedure; or
If the service by certified mail as provided by this rule is returned with an
endorsement showing the service was refused or unclaimed, then the subpoena may
be sent by ordinary mail, evidenced by a certificate of mailing.
The party serving the subpoena shall file a copy of the subpoena, properly
endorsed as to service, at or prior to the hearing for which the subpoena was
issued.
The commission may, when directed by a party, mail subpoenas by ordinary United
States mail to the last known address of the person as directed by the party
requesting the subpoena.
      1)   The commission shall not mail subpoenas less than fourteen (14)
calendar days in advance of a hearing. If subpoenas cannot be mailed more than
fourteen (14) calendar days in advance of a hearing, the Civil Service
Commission shall, on request, hold the subpoenas so they can be served on the
witness at the hearing.
      2)   If the commission is requested to serve the subpoena by ordinary
mail, then the subpoena is deemed delivered when mailed.
To be enforceable, witnesses shall receive their subpoenas at least seven (7)
calendar days prior to the hearing. Subpoenas duces tecum shall be received at
least ten (10) calendar days prior to the record hearing. Absent proof a
witness has received a subpoena in a timely manner, the commission shall not
enforce the subpoena nor hold the record open for the testimony of an
unsubpoenaed non-appearing witness.
Hearings shall not be continued due to the absence of a witness subpoenaed
under this rule.
The commission will not again issue subpoenas when a hearing has been continued
unless specifically requested to do so in writing.
Upon motion and for good cause, the commission may quash any subpoena. Motions
to quash shall be raised, in writing, prior to a hearing. Unless a motion to
quash has been granted, a witness shall attend the hearing to which he or she
was subpoenaed.
Witnesses may not be subpoenaed to prehearings.
No character witness shall be subpoenaed to attend hearings. This prohibition
does not pertain to witnesses testifying to the credibility of another witness.
To the extent as permitted by law, O.R.C. 124.09 (G) shall apply under the
limited adoption of O.R.C. 124.40, as limited by Chapter
155 of the Codified Ordinances and rule
2.1 of these Rules, which gives municipal civil service commissions all other
powers and duties which respect to the civil service of the city, city school
district and city health district as conferred upon the director of
administrative services and state personnel board of review.
Rule 14.37   Mileage Reimbursement And Subpoenaed Witness Fees
Public employees may be paid witness fees only if they were subpoenaed to a
hearing which they attended at a time they were not scheduled to work. Public
employees shall be paid by their appointing authority for the time they are
absent from their jobs to attend hearings before the commission, provided they
were either subpoenaed or were parties to the action.
Mileage shall be paid to any subpoenaed witness, not a party, who works or
resides outside of Henry County and who incurs unreimbursed travel expense to
attend hearings before the commission. Neither parking costs nor food and
lodging are reimbursable.
Parties may not subpoena themselves.
Mileage and witness fees shall not be paid to anyone who fails to register at
the hearing attended.
Any costs associated with any subpoena shall be taxed to the losing party.
Witness fees and mileage costs shall be deposited with the Finance Director (or
council clerk when one exists) prior to the issuance of any subpoena, subject
to refund to the prevailing party. In the event that the said Finance Director
or council clerk is of the opinion that the deposit on file regarding the
appeal is sufficient to cover the costs, then the additional deposit under this
paragraph may be waived by the Finance Director or council clerk.
When an appellant withdraws an appeal, the appellant shall be deemed for the
mere purpose of paying costs associated with subpoenas, the losing party,
unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.
Rule 14.38   Failure To Appear
If neither the appellant nor appellant's authorized representative appears at a
hearing, the commission may dismiss the appeal.
If neither the appellee nor appellee's authorized representative appears at a
hearing, the commission may grant appropriate relief, including disaffirmance
of the order.
If neither party appears at a hearing, the commission may, based upon the
information available to it, resolve the appeal in the manner it deems
appropriate.
Rule 14.39   Settlements And Withdrawals
An appeal may be withdrawn any time prior to the issuance of the final order of
the commission. All withdrawals shall be in writing and shall be signed by
either the appellant or appellant's representative.
An appeal may be settled by the parties thereto any time prior to the issuance
of a final order of the commission. The commission will accept signed
settlement agreements and incorporate them into its final order. All settlement
agreements shall be in writing and shall be signed by all affected parties and
their representatives.
If the commission is notified a case has been withdrawn or settled, and no
settlement agreement or withdrawal is filed with the commission within fourteen
(14) calendar days of the notification to the commission, then the commission
shall schedule the case for a hearing.
Rule 14.40   Reserved
Rule 14.41   Exchange Of Documents And Witness Lists
      1)   On written request of the opposing party, a party shall, at least
twenty-eight (28) calendar days prior to the first scheduled record hearing,
provide to the requesting party the documents intended to be introduced at the
hearing and a list of witnesses and shall provide to the commission a list of
documents intended to be introduced at the hearing and a list of witnesses.
Such requests must be served upon the opposing party at least forty-two (42)
calendar days prior to the first scheduled record hearing.
      2)   Upon receipt of a written request, and at least twenty-eight (28)
calendar days prior to the first scheduled record hearing, a party shall permit
the opposing party to view and copy, at the opposing party's expense, any
documents intended to be introduced at a hearing.
      3)   If a party fails, without good cause, to comply with paragraphs (1)
and (2) of this Rule, such testimony or documents may, upon motion of the
adversely affected party, be excluded from a hearing before the commission.
Failure to serve requests for documents and a list of witnesses or for the
examination of documents at least forty-two (42) calendar days before the first
scheduled record hearing waives all right to move to exclude such evidence.
      4)   The commission may extend times as established in this rule and
continue hearings in order to permit discovery under this rule.

The commission may order depositions upon motion of any party.
      1)   A motion to take deposition shall be filed, in writing, with the

commission may continue a hearing for depositions. Absent compelling reasons,
the commission may grant such motions.
      2)   The cost of such deposition shall be borne by the party requesting
the deposition.
      3)   If a deposition is to be submitted into evidence as a testimonial
deposition, the deposition must be submitted on videotape. As an alternative to

assertion of dismissal, demotion or suspension when no "order" has been filed
with the commission.
Motions to make definite and certain shall specify, with particularity, what

Failure to serve a motion to make definite and certain at least twenty-one (21)
calendar days prior to the record hearing waives all right to move to exclude

to make definite and certain within fourteen calendar days after receipt of the
motion.
The commission shall, upon proper motion, determine the adequacy of a party's
response.
The commission may extend the time to respond to a motion to make definite and

recommendation will be again mailed.
A copy of the report and recommendation may be secured in person by the
parties, in lieu of mailing, from the office of the commission after signing a
receipt for the report and recommendation.
Rule 14.47   Objections To Reports And Recommendations

not already in the record shall be stricken.
      3)   All objections and responses to objections shall have attached a
certificate of service. If none is attached, then the commission will not

Rule 14.48   Commission Action On Reports And Recommendations
The commission may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, any report
and recommendation.
The commission may take additional evidence, hear arguments, issue a stay order
pending the decision of the board on a motion for reconsideration or remand an
appeal to an assigned commission officer for further consideration or hearing.
Rule 14.49   Final Order Of The Commission

Rule 14.50   Motions For Reconsideration
Any party may move for reconsideration of a final order of the commission.
Motions for reconsideration shall be filed within ten (10) calendar days of
mailing of the final order. After a motion for reconsideration has been filed,
and if no appeal has been filed in a court of common pleas, then a stay of the
order will be issued pending the reconsideration. The opposing party will then
have ten (10) calendar days to file a response to the motion for
reconsideration. The filing of a notice of appeal of a commission order divests
the commission of jurisdiction to rule on a motion for reconsideration. The
filing of a motion for reconsideration does not toll the time to appeal the
commission’s final order.
Rule 14.51   Appeals To The Court Of Common Pleas
The parties if not contrary to ordinance or resolution, and where otherwise
authorized by law, may appeal a final decision of the commission in accordance

Upon filing with the commission a notice of appeal to the court of common
pleas, the party filing such notice shall deposit with the commission a sum in
accordance with the following schedule:
      1)   If audio recordings is requested, the sum of $1.00 or the actual
costs of the media, whichever is greater.
      2)   If transcripts are requested, the sum of $250.00 or the estimated
cost of the transcriptions, whichever is greater.
      3)   In the event the hearing was recorded by a stenographer, the sum of
$250.00 or the estimated cost of the transcription, whichever is greater.
After the commission has received the deposit, the transcript and copies of the
file will be prepared and the actual cost of those items will be calculated. If
the deposit exceeds the costs of these items, then a refund of the excess will
be issued; if the deposit does not cover the full amount, then it will be
retained in accordance with this rule.
The deposit will be retained by the commission until the appeal process has
been completed. If the deposit does not cover the full amount of the costs, and
the costs have been assessed to the party who paid the deposit, then that party
will be billed for the remaining costs and the deposit will not be returned.
Should the costs be assessed to the opposing party, then that party will be
billed for the full amount of the costs and the deposit will be returned to the
party who paid the deposit.
If a person alleges the inability to pay the deposit, then an "Affidavit of
Indigence" must be completed. Said affidavit is available from the commission
upon request.
Upon the submission of the affidavit, the commission will determine if the
person is or is not excused from paying the deposit.

construed as to invalidate any other rule.

of the State of Ohio.

representative who refuses to comply with its directions or who engages in
dilatory tactics or contemptuous behavior in the course of any proceeding
before the commission. (Ord. 016-12. Passed 3-5-12.)
   195.15  RULE 15 WAIVER OF RULES.
In specific cases where, in the judgment of the commission, it is in the best
interest of the public service, any Rule may be waived or suspended by a
majority vote of the commission. In addition, any Rule requested by an officer
or employee and concurred in by the appointing authority may be waived or

Should any section, clause or provision of these Rules and Procedures or any
amendment thereto be in conflict with any collective bargaining agreement,
covering a bargaining unit employee who is also a civil service employee, that

(a)   Applicability, Purpose and Interpretation
The term "Code" as used in this Chapter shall be interpreted to mean the
"Personnel Code" unless its context clearly indicates otherwise and shall be
considered part of the Administrative Code of the City of Napoleon, Ohio,
whether codified or not.

"Personnel Code" shall be construed to mean this Code.
This Code supersedes and replaces all applicable federal and state laws,
statutes, codes, policies, and all matters or issues pertaining to employee
wages, benefits, and working conditions over which it has authority to
supersede and replace. However, an ordinance or resolution of the City may
supersede this Code if the specific issue or issues addressed in the ordinance
or resolution conflict with this Code. A typical example of when this may occur
is when a new hire negotiates terms different than this Code, but it is not
limited to just this example.
Further, this Code does not pertain to the position of Judge of the Napoleon
Municipal Court which shall be controlled by the Ohio Revised Code, except for
the benefits as authorized by Section

In the event that any provision of this Code and its application to any
employee is held to be contrary to law by a court of competent jurisdiction, in
areas of law that it may not be contrary, it shall be of no further force and
effect, except to the extent permitted by law; but all other provisions and
applications shall continue in full force and effect.
Any provision of a collective bargaining agreement shall govern matters covered
herein only to the extent required by law. Nothing in this Code shall be
construed as giving additional benefits to members of a bargaining unit that

197.03    EMPLOYEE RECORDS AND DISCIPLINE
(a)   Access to Personnel Service Records
Employee service records shall only be accessible by the public to the extent
required or permitted by law.
(b)   Causes for Discipline
(1)   Applicability and Overview
Any employee may be disciplined for just or proper cause. Violations of any
municipal ordinance, statutes or other law of any political subdivision or any
state, and violations of any or all city policies, rules or regulations or
lawful orders shall constitute just or proper cause. Finally, any violation
contained in a collective bargaining agreement shall also constitute proper
cause for discipline as it relates to collective bargaining employees.
(2)   Closure of Items Related to Discipline
Employee's personal service record as it relates to discipline shall be marked
closed for the purpose of progressive discipline in accordance with the
following schedule; however, such shall be subject to the public records law:
•   Reprimands
 
Any reprimand shall be closed from the record after one (1) year from the date
of the reprimand, providing there is no intervening disciplinary action during
the one (1) year period.
 
   •    Suspensions Less Than Thirty (30) Days
 
Any suspension of less than thirty (30) days shall be closed from the record
after a period of two (2) years, providing there is no intervening disciplinary
action during the two (2) year period.
 
•   Suspensions Longer Than Thirty (30) Days
 
Any suspension of thirty (30) days or more shall be closed from the record
after three (3) years, providing that there is no intervening disciplinary
action during the three (3) year period.
 
(c)   Discipline Action as it Relates to Classified Employees
 
Where the City deems appropriate, the City will apply a policy of progressive
and corrective discipline, with the progressive steps as follows: oral
reprimand; written reprimand; suspension; demotion; or, dismissal (this section
is not applicable to those persons or positions considered the appointing
authority or to other unclassified employees). This section is not to be
construed as prohibiting suspension or dismissal without progressive discipline
where the cause for such suspension or dismissal is deemed warranted by the
City due to the nature or circumstances of the conduct involved.
 
(1)   Oral and Written Reprimands
 
When it becomes necessary for a supervisor to reprimand a classified employee,
it shall be done with discretion.
 
In the event that a supervisor finds it necessary to orally reprimand an
employee and determines to keep a record of that oral reprimand, such employee
shall be made aware that a record of such oral reprimand is being maintained in
the City's files or records. Employees are not entitled to hearings for oral
reprimands.
 
Classified Employees may appeal a written reprimand to a review officer
designated by the appointing authority, but may not appeal the disciplinary
action to the Civil Service Commission. Such review shall be informal and the
rules of evidence shall not apply. A classified employee may thereafter submit
a written statement to the appointing authority concerning the reprimand and
outlining such employee's basis for concern, and a copy of such statement shall
be appended to the copy of the reprimand in such employee's personal service
record. Such statement must be filed within ten (10) days of the determination
of the appointing authority to approve a reprimand.
 
The supervisor shall provide the classified employee with a copy of any written
reprimand or any record of oral reprimand entered in such employee's file. The
classified employee shall acknowledge receipt of same by signing and dating the
original copy of such record.
 
(2)   Procedure for (Disciplinary) Suspension, Demotion, or Dismissal.
 
Classified employees shall not be suspended, demoted, or dismissed for
disciplinary reasons from duty without first being afforded the opportunity for
a disciplinary review before the appointing authority or his/her designee,
except that, where it is necessary to immediately relieve the employee from
duty due to gross misconduct, a department head or his/her designee may
temporarily suspend such employee for a period not to exceed seventy-two (72)
hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.
 
When a classified employee has been suspended without a disciplinary review,
such employee shall be afforded a disciplinary review before the appointing
authority or his/her designee within seventy-two (72) hours, excluding
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. The employee's pay status for the days which
he/she was suspended shall be determined by the appointing authority or his/her
designee at the disciplinary review.
 
When a classified employee is charged with a violation that is likely to result
in such employee receiving a disciplinary suspension, demotion, or dismissal,
the following shall apply:
 
•   Except as provided above, the classified employee shall be given notice at
least five (5) calendar days in advance of the disciplinary review and that

(d)   Grievance Procedure
 
(1)   Applicability and Overview
 
This Section is not applicable to those persons or positions defined as the
appointing authority or other unclassified employees.
 
It is the intent of the City that this grievance procedure be the sole and
exclusive grievance and appeal procedure for classified employees, and any
other grievance and appeal procedures shall not be applicable.
 
Grievances and appeals related to disciplinary matters shall be handled in
accordance with the herein established grievance procedures. This Section is
limited to grievances related to all other issues regarding wages, benefits,
and terms and conditions of employment, excluding disciplinary action(s).

The time limits provided for herein shall be strictly adhered to. Any grievance
not initially submitted or appealed to the next step within the specified time
limits shall be deemed invalid or resolved based upon the City's last answer,
as the case may be (an untimely grievance is void and an untimely appealed
grievance is resolved based on the last answer); provided however, that any
grievance not answered by the City within the stipulated time limits may be
advanced by the employee to the next step in the grievance procedure. All time
limits on grievances may be extended upon mutual consent of the City and
employee affected.
If an emergency occurs, rights of grievance under this Code may be suspended.
Upon the termination of any emergency should valid grievances exist, they shall
be processed in accordance with the provisions outlined in the grievance
procedure of this Code and shall proceed from the point in the grievance
procedure to which they (the grievances) had properly progressed, prior to the
emergency.

In order for a grievance to receive consideration under this procedure, the
grievant must identify the grievance to the employee's immediate supervisor, in
writing, within twelve (12) calendar days of the employee having, through the
exercise of reasonable diligence, knowledge of the occurrence of the incident
giving rise to the grievance. The employee's immediate supervisor shall
investigate and provide an appropriate answer within six (6) calendar days
following the day on which the employee's immediate supervisor was presented
the grievance.
 
B.   Step 2 - Review by Department Head
 
If the grievance is not resolved in Step 1, and the supervisor is not the
department head, then the employee may, within six (6) calendar days of the
supervisor's response, take up the grievance with his department head. The
department head shall investigate and respond to the grievant within six (6)
calendar days after receiving the Step 1 reply.
 
C.   Step 3 - Review by Appointing Authority
 
Where the grievance is filed with a member of the appointing authority, due to
the absence of an immediate supervisor or department head position in that
department and is not resolved accordingly, another member of the appointing
authority shall be appointed to hear said grievance and render a decision in
accordance with the provisions of this Step 3.
 
(5)   Scheduling of Grievance Hearings
 
Grievance hearings called for in this chapter may be scheduled at the
discretion of the department head or appointing authority, whichever is
applicable, taking into consideration the grievant's work shift.
 
(6)   Who May Bring Grievance
 
A grievance may be brought by any employee, except: the appointing authorities,
unclassified employees and employees covered by a collective bargaining
agreement. Where a group of such employees desire to file a grievance involving
a situation affecting each employee in the same manner, one (1) employee
selected by such group may process the grievance as a class action grievance,
provided each such employee desiring to be included in the class action
grievance, signs said grievance and the grievance is filed in a timely manner.
For the purpose of this Section timely manner shall be within seven (7) days
after notice is received.

A recall from layoff shall be based on departmental seniority by job
classification (last laid off, first recalled). Notice of recall from a long
term layoff shall be by certified or registered mail. If certified or
registered mail is returned as undeliverable, the City shall be deemed to have
fulfilled its obligations by mailing the recall notice to the last mailing
address provided by the employee by regular U.S. Mail.
 
(4)   Response Time to Recall Notices
 
In the case of long term layoff, the employee shall have fourteen (14) calendar
days following the date of mailing the recall notice to notify the City of his/

until such time as the employee has met City residency requirements. In the
event the suspension exceeds two (2) weeks in duration, the employee may be
dismissed from the City service.
(e)   Unless otherwise prohibited by law, this section shall not be construed
as to limit the enforceability of any residency provision found in a collective
bargaining agreement between the City and a collective bargaining unit;
further, nothing herein shall be construed as to limit the ability of an
appointing authority of the City to require residency of its volunteers. (Ord.

position, he/she shall be subject to a thirty (30) calendar day probationary
period. The employee shall have ten (10) working days in which to voluntarily
return to his/her former position. The City may return the employee to his/her
former position at any time during the probation period.
If a full-time regular employee in the classified service is involuntarily
transferred from one (1) department to another, in a noncompetitive position,
he/she shall be subject to a probationary period of one hundred and eighty
(180) days. If he/she should be unsuccessful in his/her new position he/she may
be laid off if no other suitable position exists within the City.
(c)   Transfers Within City
If a full-time regular employee of the classified service voluntarily transfers
to another department within the City, such employee will lose all departmental
seniority rights previously earned in his/her pre-transfer department, and will
be placed at the bottom of the seniority list of the department to which he/she
has transferred.
In the case of non-disciplinary involuntary transfers to another City position,
such employee will retain all seniority rights which he/she would have had if
he/she had not been transferred.
(d)   Vacancies in the City
(1)   Except in the case of rehire, where the City’s policy on rehire shall
control, when a non-competitive classified vacancy occurs in a position within
the City, the appointing authority shall, when practical, cause to be posted
such position for a period of at least ten (10) business days and first
consider employees within the department division and then the department where
the vacancy exists and next consider employees generally within the City's
services. “First consider” shall mean, with all other things being equal, the
person within the division or department where the vacancy exists shall be
given the utmost consideration for filling the vacancy. “Employee” as used in
the context of this provision includes, full-time regular, permanent part time,
part time, and temporary employees. The City appointing authority may hire from
outside the City services, without necessity of posting, when deemed by the
appointing authority it not practical to post or fill the position by transfer.
Only when posted within the City services may an employee apply for the
position by proper filing of a transfer application therefor. If such employee
is granted the position applied for, such position shall be considered a
voluntary transfer.
   (2)   A person serving in a paid part-time position with the City’s Fire and
Rescue Department and who applied for a vacant position by transfer may accept
the new position that is the subject of the transfer without vacating his or
her current paid part-time position, unless otherwise determined by an affected
appointing authority.
   (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as to prohibit the
appointing authority from simultaneously posting the position within the City

competitive classified positions, civil service examinations and procedures
shall apply to the extent required.
(e)   Step Increases When Transferred.
When an employee is involuntarily transferred from one position to another, any
step increase eligibility shall be on the employee's original hire anniversary
date as if the employee was not transferred. If any employee makes a voluntary
transfer, an employee must complete probation within the new classification
prior to being eligible for any step increase, such eligibility being on the
employee’s original hire anniversary date. In the event that the voluntary
transfer employee's original hire anniversary date passes while an employee is
on probation, then the step increase eligibility shall be immediate upon
completing probation and said employee will be eligible for an additional step
increase at the employee's next immediate original hire anniversary date.
Finally, in the event that an employee returns to his/her prior classification
and missed a step increase in that prior classification, he/she shall be placed
in the step as if never vacating the position effective on the date of such
occurrence. Any increase shall be subject to successful performance evaluation.
Nothing in this provision shall be construed as requiring any step increase.

197.11 SAFETY WORK GROUP
A safety work group made up of those members that serve in or under the
Department of Management as deemed appropriate by the City Manager shall be
established by the City Manager. This is not a board of committee of city
council and is not a “public body” as defined in ORC 121.22. The purpose of the
Safety Committee is to discuss safety policies and procedures for City
operations for the approval of the City Manager, which, upon approval shall
have the full force and effect of any other rule or regulation established by
the City.
An employee within the Department of Management may be required to be a member
of and to participate in the City’s safety work group.
Enforcement of safety policies so established will be the same as for any other
work rule established by the City.
(Ord. 035-22. Passed 7-18-22.)
197.12 SENIORITY
Except as may otherwise specifically be provided for in this Code, seniority
shall be computed on the basis of an employee's uninterrupted length of
continuous service with the City. For the purpose of this section, all paid
leaves are considered uninterrupted continuous service; moreover, unpaid leaves
as follows, shall not be considered an interruption of continuous service:
suspensions, military leave during the time a person is eligible for
reinstatement, injury leave for injuries occurring on duty, FMLA leave and
pregnancy/temporary disability leave. An employee who is laid off and then is
properly reinstated to City service within one year from the date of the layoff

Likewise, up to a maximum of six months will be credited for time spent on an
approved unpaid leave of absence, except when the leave of absence is for
outside employment, including self-employment, then the employee shall receive
no credit during the leave. Nothing in this section shall be construed as
superseding or modifying provisions of this Code and policies of the City
concerning how probationary periods are calculated. Department seniority when
transfers are involved are controlled by Section
197.09(c).

(4)   Pay Changes - Promotions, Transfers, Demotions and Reallocations
 
A.   Promotions to Higher Class

authority.

When an employee's position is reallocated to a lower class of positions (non-
disciplinary), the employee shall be permitted to continue at his/her present
rate (except in event of general service wide reductions), but such employee
shall not be entitled to any base pay increase by any mechanism whatsoever,
until and unless the sum of the base rate of pay for the reallocated position
in the newly established level and class of the employee, plus any longevity
pay entitlements of the employee applied to the base pay of the new level and
class would become greater than the actual present pay rate of the employee.
 
E.   Reinstated Employees
 
A reinstated employee shall be paid at a base pay within the approval range for
the position to which he/she is reinstated. The appointing authority will
establish the rate of pay.

time off within the above categories will be determined by departmental
seniority from an employee's most recent employment date only when employees
apply for vacation on the same calendar day. Advanced application for vacation
may be made so long as the employee will have credited the requested hours at
the time the employee's vacation is to commence; however, an employee may not,
in advance, lock in vacation dates for multiple years.
Exceptions to minimum notice may be permitted subject to the approval of the
appropriate supervisor.
Authorization of time off is subject to availability of personnel, and the
recognized City objective of minimizing overtime paid.

Immediate family, for the purposes of this Section, shall be defined as the
employee's grandparents, brother, sister, father, father-in-law, mother,
mother-in-law, spouse, child, stepchild, grandchild, or legal guardian.
A full-time regular employee shall be granted a one (1) day leave of absence
with pay to attend the funeral of his/her spouse's brother, sister and

Except as herein provided, each employee shall be entitled to five (5) personal

the calendar year or they will be lost. Personal holidays from year to year

converted to eight (8) hours cash payment on the first pay of December.
Instead of what has been stated above, the Assistant Chief of the fire/rescue
department shall be entitled to five (5) personal days or one hundred twenty
(120) hours each calendar year.

(1)    Crediting of Sick Leave
Except as otherwise provided, sick leave credit shall be earned at the rate of
0.0575 hours for each hour of service only in active pay status, up to a
maximum yearly accumulation of one hundred twenty (120) hours. Unused sick
leave credit shall accumulate from year to year without limit. Effective
September 1, 2000, of the non-full-time regular status employees, only
permanent part-time employees shall earn sick leave credit and at the same rate
as full-time regular employees; however, any other part-time or temporary
employee that received such benefit prior to September 1, 2000 shall retain the
same until such time is otherwise exhausted.
The Assistant Chief if the fire/rescue department may accumulate a maximum of
one hundred ninety-two (192) sick leave hours each calendar year; however, in
no event shall the Assistant Chief of the fire/rescue department accumulate
more than three thousand six hundred (3,600) total hours.
(2)    Retention of Sick Leave
An employee who formerly worked for another public agency shall be given credit
for any accumulated but unused sick leave provided that the employee was hired
by the City within ten (10) years of the date on which the employee was last
terminated from public service, and further provided that deduction from such
sick leave credit shall be made for any payment or credit given by the previous
agency in lieu of taking sick leave.
Unless otherwise provided by a specific ordinance or resolution of Council
pertaining to employment or previously authorized by the City, the sick leave
so credited (transferred) may be used only to extend sick leave coverage while
in the employment of the City, and only after all sick leave earned at the City
has been exhausted; further, unless otherwise provided, such credited
(transferred) sick leave may not be used in computing sick leave payout at
retirement or additional (sick leave conversion) vacation leave purposes.
This provision shall not narrow or reduce the amount of sick leave credit
received, nor shall it narrow or reduce a current sick leave balance, a sick
leave conversion right or sick leave payout, as was previously authorized, of
any person who is employed by the City at the time of this Code enactment.
(3)    Expiration of Sick Leave
If illness or disability continues beyond the time covered by earned sick
leave, the employee may be granted further leave in accordance with the City's
FMLA policy, or other applicable leave policies, subject to qualification.
(4)    Charging of Sick Leave
Sick leave shall be charged in minimum units of one-quarter (1/4) hour. An
employee shall be charged for such leave only for days upon which he/she would
otherwise have been scheduled to work. Sick leave payment shall not exceed the
normal scheduled work day or work week earnings.
(5)    Uses of Sick Leave
Sick leave shall be granted to an employee who qualifies for sick leave only
upon approval of the City and for the following reasons:
   Illness or injury of the employee that requires time off from work.
   Illness or injury to a member of an employee's immediate family when care or
attendance by the employee is necessary requiring time off from work.
Medical, dental or optical examination or treatment of an employee or a member
of his/her immediate family which requires the employee to take time off work,
and which cannot be scheduled during non-working hours or, when a member of the
immediate family of an employee is afflicted with a contagious disease that
requires the care and attendance of the employee or when, through exposure to a
contagious disease the presence of the employee at his/her job would jeopardize
the health of others.
For the purpose of this section, immediate family shall include the employee's
father, mother, spouse, child, without regard to residency and will include a
stepchild if in the employee's residence. The immediate family provisions
contained herein shall be for a limited period of time (not to exceed three (3)
consecutive days per week) to enable the employee to secure other arrangements
for the care of the member of his/her immediate family, except as may be
approved by the employee's appointing authority in unusual and exceptional
circumstances.
* Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, pregnancy, childbirth
and other related medical conditions and temporary disability requiring the
necessity of an employee to take time off work, will be considered, subject to
qualification, under the FMLA and pregnancy and temporary disability policies
of the City. In cases where any other leave qualifies, the applicable leave
policy shall control in accordance with the City's Employment Policy Manual.
(6)    Evidence Required for Sick Leave Usage
Any employee requesting sick leave shall be required to furnish a satisfactory
written signed statement to justify the use of sick leave.
If medical attention is required, a certificate stating the nature of the
illness from a physician shall be required to justify the use of sick leave.
Falsification of either a written, signed statement, or a physician's
certificate may be grounds for disciplinary action including dismissal.
(7)    Notification by Employee
When an employee is unable to report to work, he/she shall notify his/her
immediate supervisor, or other designated person, one (1) hour before the time
he/she is scheduled to report to work on each day of absence, unless emergency
conditions make it impossible, or other arrangements have been made in advance
with the supervisor.
(8)    Abuse of Sick Leave
Employees failing to comply with sick leave rules and regulations shall not be
paid for the period of time missed from work. Application for sick leave with
intent to defraud will result in denial of pay to cover the day(s) in question
and may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. If pay has
been received for sick leave for which there was no entitlement, the City shall
have the right to recover from the employee any money wrongly paid.
Sick leave shall not be paid to any employee for time off of work which results
from any action within the control of the employee such as intentional self-
inflicted wounds, use of illegal drugs, alcoholic beverages, or injury
sustained while committing a felony or other criminal action. This provision
shall not apply to sick leave used for the purposes of participating in bona
fide drug treatment, alcohol treatment, or mental health treatment programs.
(9)    Physician Statement
Employees on sick leave on more than three (3) consecutive working days shall
be required to furnish a certificate from a physician notifying the City that
the employee is unable to perform the job, and may be required to present a
like certificate from a physician upon the employee's return to work indicating
his/her fitness and ability to perform the job.
In addition, employees shall also be required to furnish a certificate from a
physician for each illness of less than three (3) days duration, for each
occasion which exceeds any one (1) of the following calendar year limits:
Two (2) occasions per employee for the employee's illness, for which no
physician's certificate was presented and/or two (2) occasions per family
member, for which no physician's certificate was presented; however, the total
occasions per calendar year shall not exceed four (4).
Exceptions may be made to the limits listed above in certain circumstances, and
only upon advance written approval of the department head or the appointing
authority, whichever is applicable.
Employees may be required to furnish a certificate from a physician for each
illness of less than three (3) days duration, for each occasion which is less
than any one (1) of the calendar year limits shown above, if the City has
reasonable suspicion that sick leave abuse is occurring or will occur.
Where sick leave is requested to care for a member of the immediate family, the
City may require a physician's certificate to the effect that the presence of
the employee is necessary to care for the ill person.
(10)    Physical Examination
The City may require an employee to take an examination, conducted by a
physician, to determine the employee's physical or mental capability to perform
the job. If determined incapable of doing so as a result of such examination,
the employee may be placed on paid leave of absence, unpaid leave of absence,
or disability separation. The cost of such examination shall be paid by the
City.
(11)    Sick-Leave Payout
Unless otherwise provided or modified by a specific ordinance or resolution of
Council pertaining to employment, or unless otherwise declined by the employee,
or otherwise deferred by the employee in anticipation of rehire by the City,
any employee who retires or otherwise departs service, other than an
involuntary departure, after ten (10) years of continuous service with the City
or who dies in service after five (5) years of continuous service with the
City, except part-time permanent employees, shall be compensated for
accumulated but unused sick leave at the time of retirement or, death in the
form of a lump sum payment at the rate of:
   • One (1) day's pay for every four (4) days of accumulated but unused sick
leave up to nine hundred sixty (960) hours; the remaining time shall be at the
rate of one (1) day's pay for every three (3) days of accumulated but unused
sick leave.
   • Such lump sum payment shall reduce to zero (i.e., eliminate) the
employee's sick leave credit.
An employee's "daily base rate" or "day's pay" shall be figured by dividing the
employee's annual base rate at the time of retirement or voluntary departure by
2080 hours and multiplying that base hourly rate figure by eight (8) hours.
The death benefit payment shall be made to the beneficiary designated by the
employee in writing on a form provided by the City. In the event that there is
no such valid designation, the payment shall be made to the employee's estate
upon application of the legal representative thereof.
In the case of sick leave payout being deferred in anticipation of rehire by
the City, the sick leave reconciliation shall be made as provided for in this
section. A rehired employee shall be entitled to use all or part of the
deferred sick leave so long as it is used in accordance with use of sick leave
policies of the City. Any deferred sick leave amount may be demanded for
payment by the earner of the sick leave, at anytime in accordance with the sick
leave payout schedule, so long as the sick leave is not used or otherwise
transferred to another governmental entity. In any event, full reconciliation
and settlement of deferred sick leave payout shall be completed not later than
twenty-four (24) months after last employment with the City.

converting three (3) sick leave days for each one (1) day of vacation time. An
employee may convert up to a maximum of fifteen (15) such excess sick leave
days per calendar year. However, such conversion shall not be permitted if
payment of overtime to another employee becomes necessary as a result. This

   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section arrives after the motor
vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the
property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give
the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator
may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor
vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing
service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available
at the time of the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.

removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the person
from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it has
been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.

vehicle was towed within a municipal corporation that has established fees for
vehicle removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (4)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

   303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible

the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private

the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the

operators to be licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,

to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a

search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.

party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of

guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars

fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation

court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the

any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be

   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn

during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.

The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not

walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.

R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.

(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three

be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance withdrawn under
this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved
by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by
the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.

hereof, the person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a
qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing
administer a chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to
any administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or

considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a

notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.

   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
                The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the
three-day jail term under this subsection if it places the offender under a
community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three
days, requires the offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a
drivers’ intervention program so certified, and sentences the offender to a
jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days that the
offender does not spend attending the program. The court may require the
offender, as a condition of community control and in addition to the required
attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily
complete any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum
standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental
Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the drivers’ intervention
program determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to
the court on the offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose
on the offender any other conditions of community control that it considers
necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
               The court may require the offender, under a community control
sanction imposed under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete
any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum standards
adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and
Addiction Services, in addition to the required attendance at drivers’
intervention program, that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program
determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to the
court on the offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose any
other conditions of community control on the offender that it considers
necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy- five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten- day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and

section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or other equivalent offenses is guilty of a misdemeanor. The court

section, it instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both
a jail term and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to
the thirty-day mandatory jail term. Notwithstanding the jail terms set forth in

      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty- day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

whose driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended under this section files an appeal regarding
any aspect of the person’s trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay
the operation of the suspension.
   (m)   Subsection (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the amount
specified in that subsection, if both of the following apply:

section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.16(D) in
the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (o)   Conflict of Terms. All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to
this section. If the meaning of a term defined in Ohio R.C . 4510.01 conflicts

violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of

punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

      (3)   An employer, school official or official affiliated with a
religious event is not liable in damages in a civil action for any injury,
death or loss to person or property that allegedly arises from, or is related
to, the fact that the employer, school official, or official affiliated with a
religious event provided the holder of a probationary driver’s license with the
written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.
The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to serve
as the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section,

vehicular travel or parking with more than one person who is not a family
member occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is
accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or

attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months

under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or
subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the violation may
terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under
subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
   (d)   No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon

vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or
is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.

if the stepparent has not adopted the probationary license holder;
         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets. “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a

age of eighteen years and no holder of a probationary driver’s license shall
drive a motor vehicle on any street, highway, or property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular traffic or parking while using in any manner an
electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor
vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and

   (c)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

Code, at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.

delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process which commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings thereon are set aside or reversed on appeal.

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

(Ord. 071-08. Passed 10-6-08.)
   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
   501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become    inadmissible because of
his complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
   501.13 CONSPIRACY.

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.

R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   A.   "Dangerous dog" means a dog that, without provocation, and
subject to subsection (a)(1)B. hereof, has chased or approached in either a
menacing fashion or an apparent attitude of attack, or has attempted to bite or
otherwise endanger any person, while that dog is off the premises of its owner,
keeper or harborer and not under the reasonable control of its owner, keeper,
harborer or some other responsible person, or not physically restrained or
confined in a locked pen which has a top, locked fenced yard or other locked
enclosure which has a top.
         B.   "Dangerous dog" does not include a police dog that has chased or
approached in either a menacing fashion or an apparent attitude of attack, or
has attempted to bite or otherwise endanger any person while the police dog is
being used to assist one or more law enforcement officers in the performance of
their official duties.
      (2)   “Menacing fashion" means that a dog would cause any person being
chased or approached to reasonably believe that the dog will cause physical
injury to that person.
      (3)   "Police dog" means a dog that has been trained, and may be used, to
assist one or more law enforcement officers in the performance of their
official duties.
      (4)   A.   "Vicious dog" means a dog that, without provocation and
subject to subsection (a)(4)B. hereof, meets any of the following:
            1.   Has killed or caused serious injury to any persons;
            2.   Has caused injury, other than killing or serious injury to any
person, or has killed another dog;
         B.   "Vicious dog" does not include either of the following:
            1.   A police dog that has killed or caused serious injury to any
person or that has caused injury, other than killing or serious injury, to any
person while the police dog is being used to assist one or more law enforcement
officers in the performance of their official duties;
            2.   A dog that has killed or caused serious injury to any person
while a person was committing or attempting to commit a trespass or other
criminal offense on the property of the owner, keeper or harborer of the dog.
      (5)   "Without provocation" means that a dog was not teased, tormented or
abused by a person, or that the dog was not coming to the aid or the defense of
a person who was not engaged in illegal or criminal activity and who was not
using the dog as a means of carrying out such activity.
   (b)   Except when a dangerous or vicious dog is lawfully engaged in hunting
or training for the purpose of hunting and is accompanied by the owner, keeper,
harborer, or handler of the dog, no owner, keeper or harborer of a dangerous or
vicious dog shall fail to do either of the following:
      (1)   While that dog is on the premises of the owner, keeper or harborer,
securely confine it at all times in a building, in a locked pen which has a
top, locked fenced yard or other locked enclosure which has a top, except that
a dangerous dog may, in the alternative, be tied with a leash or tether so that
the dog is adequately restrained;
      (2)   While that dog is off the premises of the owner, keeper or
harborer, keep it on a chain-link leash or tether that is not more than six
feet in length and additionally do at least one of the following:
         A.   Keep that dog in a locked pen which has a top, locked fenced yard
or other locked enclosure which has a top;
         B.   Have the leash or tether controlled by a person who is of
suitable age and discretion or securely attach, tie or affix the leash or
tether to the ground or stationary object or fixture so that the dog is
adequately restrained and station such a person in close enough proximity to
that dog so as to prevent it from causing injury to any person;
         C.   Muzzle that dog.
   (c)   No owner, keeper or harborer of a vicious dog shall fail to obtain
liability insurance with an insurer authorized to write liability insurance in
this State providing coverage in each occurrence, subject to a limit, exclusive
of interest and costs, of not less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000)
because of damage or bodily injury to or death of a person caused by the
vicious dog. The failure to furnish a copy of the liability insurance policy to
a Dog Warden or a law enforcement officer that has authority to enforce Section
505.14 within ten (10) days of request by such Dog Warden or law enforcement
officer shall be prima facie evidence that the insurance does not exist.
   (d) No owner, keeper, or harborer of a dangerous or vicious dog shall
negligently permit said animal, when within the City, in a public park, public
parking lot, or upon any public sidewalk, or upon other public property that is
owned, leased, or controlled by the local, state or federal government, or upon
any private sidewalk or parking lot that is placed for use by the general
public, unless the dog is muzzled and on a chain-link leash or tether that is
not more than six (6) feet in length, except that such dangerous or vicious dog
may be transported in a motor vehicle when meeting the minimum requirements of
subsection (b)(2) hereof. 
   (e)   If a violation of subsection (b) hereof involves a dangerous dog,
whoever violates that subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree on a first offense and of a misdemeanor of the third degree on each
subsequent offense. Additionally, the court may order the offender to
personally supervise the dangerous dog that he owns, keeps or harbors, to cause
that dog to complete dog obedience training, or to do both, and the court may
order the offender to obtain liability insurance pursuant to subsection (c)
hereof. The court, in the alternative, may order the dangerous dog to be
humanely destroyed by a licensed veterinarian, the Dog Warden or the Humane
Society.
   (f)   If a violation of subsection (b) hereof involves a vicious dog,
whoever violates that subsection is guilty of one of the following:
      (1)   A misdemeanor of the first degree on a first offense. Additionally,
the court may order the vicious dog to be humanely destroyed by a licensed
veterinarian, the Dog Warden or the Humane Society.
      (2)   In the event the vicious dog kills or causes serious injury to a
person while violating subsection (b), then the charge should be filed pursuant
to Section 955.22 of the Ohio Revised Code as a felony.
   (g)   Whoever violates subsection (c) hereof is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
 
   (h)    Whoever violates subsection (d) hereof is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the fourth degree.
   (i)   Whenever an alleged violation of Section
505.14 comes to the attention of the official with authority to enforce Section
505.14, as it relates to a dangerous or vicious dog as herein defined, not
being properly insured, restrained or confined, he or she shall promptly
investigate prior to the filing of a criminal charge. Should the official,
after such investigation, believe that a violation does exist, or believe that
the dog is dangerous or vicious, he or she shall promptly notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer in the manner prescribed in this section to appear before
the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee at a date, time and place
certain to determine the question as to whether or not the dog is dangerous or
vicious as defined in Section
505.14 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (1)   The investigator shall cause a written report concerning the
dangerous or vicious dog to be filed with the City Manager along with any
photographs and evidence thereof stating his or her findings.
      (2)   Notice shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy thereof is:
         A.   Delivered to the owner, keeper or harborer of the dog by either
personal or residential service or by certified mail; or,
         B.   If the certified letter is returned showing that the letter was
not delivered, when a copy thereof is posted in a conspicuous place at the
residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog.
         C.   Notice of the hearing shall be in substantially the following
form:

the name and address of the person against whom the complaint is filed; a

   (b)   On the filing of a complaint the secretary of the Board shall make
such investigations as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues. The
investigation shall be conducted within 14 business days after the filing of
the complaint. The investigation may be extended when deemed necessary by the
chairman of the Fair Housing Board. If the secretary shall determine that there
are reasonable grounds to believe a violation has occurred, he shall attempt to
conciliate the matter by methods of initial conference and persuasion with all
interested parties and such representatives as the parties may choose to assist
them. Conciliation conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done
during such initial conferences shall be made public by any member of the Board
or its staff unless the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an
admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent agreements shall
be signed on behalf of the Board by its chairman.
   (d)   The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Commission, Ohio Civil Rights Commission, or the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development and any other person or group regarding any

appear before the Board.

of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a complaint is not
susceptible of conciliation, he shall so notify the Board and the Board shall
thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of this
chapter has been committed. The Board shall serve on the respondent a written
statement of charges and a summons and shall serve on all interested parties a
notice of the time and place of the hearing. The respondent or his authorized
counsel may file and amend such statements with the Board prior to the hearing
date as it deems necessary in support of its position. The hearing shall be
opened to the public. The hearing shall be held not less than 15 calendar days
nor more than 30 calendar days after service of the statement of charges and
summons. The summons so issued must be signed by two members of the Board and
the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of named persons and
the production of relevant documents and records. The failure to comply with a
summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The interested parties
may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or by a duly authorized
representative and may have the assistance of an attorney. The parties may
present testimony and evidence, and the right to cross examine witnesses shall
be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be given under oath or by
affirmation. The secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing, which
record shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and on request by
an) principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such party a
copy of the hearing record, at such cost as the Board deems appropriate.
   (g)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine on the
preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has violated
this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Law Director in
executive session, state its findings to and cause the Law Director to prepare
and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person complained
against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take such
affirmative action as will effectuate the purpose of this chapter, with notice
that if the Board on investigation by the secretary determines that the person
complained against has not after 15 calendar days following service of the
Board's order complied with the order, the Board will recertify the matter to
the Law Director for enforcement.
   (h)   The Law Director shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action
brought in the name of the Fair Housing Board of the City before a court of
competent jurisdiction.
   (i)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine on the
preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained against
has not violated this chapter, the Board shall so state and publish its
findings and issue its orders dismissing the complaint.

underground in the Public Rights-of-Way of the City, the Permit Holder must,
when practical, as determined by jointly by the City Engineer, also locate its
Facilities underground, Permit Holder utilizing best efforts to do so.
      (2)   Unless otherwise authorized by the Inspector for good cause,
Construction of Underground Facilities shall utilize Trenchless Technology,
including, but not limited to, horizontal drilling, directional boring, and
microtunneling, if technically and/or technologically feasible. In addition,
all cable, wire or fiber optic cable facilities to be installed underground
shall be installed in conduit, without using direct bury techniques.
   (b)   Overhead Facilities. In the event underground location of its
Facilities is not practical, the Permit Holder shall install its Facilities
only on existing utility poles. In the event it is not practical to do so, as
determined by the City Engineer after consultation with the City Electrical
Superintendent, Permit Holder utilizing best efforts to do so, then new utility
poles may be erected and used with the Citys permission. Nothing in this
provision shall be construed as eliminating any requirement of Permit Holder's
to obtain Facility attachment agreements with public or private owners of poles
and/or infrastructure and pay any fees associated therewith.
   (c)   Excess Capacity. To reduce Excavation in the Public Right-of-Way, it
is the Citys goal to encourage Permit Holders to share occupancy of underground
conduit as well as to Construct, whenever possible, excess conduit capacity for
occupancy of future Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way. Therefore, if a
Permit Holder is Constructing underground conduit in the Public Right-of-Way
for its own Facilities, and the City reasonably determines such Construction is
in an area in which other Providers would likely construct Facilities in the
future, the City may require the Permit Holder to Construct extra conduit
capacity in the Public Right-of-Way, provided the Permit Holder shall be
reimbursed for the use of the excess capacity by any other Permit Holder that
uses the excess capacity. The Permit Holder may charge a reasonable market
lease rate for occupancy of the additional conduit space as reimbursement.
   (d)   City Owned Conduit. If the City owns or leases conduit in the path of
a Permit Holders proposed Construction of Facilities, and provided it is
technologically feasible for the Permit Holders Facilities to occupy the
conduit owned or leased by the City, the Permit Holder shall be required to
occupy the conduit owned or leased by the City in order to reduce the necessity
to Excavate the Public Right-of-Way. The Permit Holder shall pay to the City a
reasonable fee for such occupancy. The City and the Permit Holder may agree to
amortize the fee through annual payments to the City.
(Ord. 133-01. Passed 12-3-01.)

telecommunications facilities or other similar Facilities are located or
relocated underground in the Public Rights-of-Way of the City, the Permit
Holder shall relocate its Facilities underground within a reasonable period of
time as determined by the City. Absent extraordinary circumstances or undue
hardship, as determined by the City, such relocation shall be made concurrently
to minimize the disruption of the Public Rights-of-Way. (Ord. 133-01. Passed
12-3-01.)

trading or exchanging products, goods, services, or crop, either for profit or
not for profit. For the purpose of this definition, services include, but are
not limited to the providing of education. Also, “commercial property” means
any property not otherwise clearly fitting into the classification of
residential or industrial property.
         B.   Common Area - Impervious areas on a premise such as driveways,
private streets, parking lots and the like utilize by tenants, guests, or
owners.
         C.   Industrial property - Any property, whether privately or publicly
owned, where such property is or was developed for, in full or in part, or on
such property there is engaged, the business or activity of developing,
manufacturing, constructing, producing or assembling any product, good, or
service either for profit or not for profit.
         D.   Impervious surface - Surfaces on or in a lot or parcel of real
property that substantially reduces the rate of infiltration of storm water
into the earth.
         E.   Residential property - Any single-family unit, whether privately
or publicly owned, standing alone or contained within a multiple- family
dwelling or mixed-use building. This includes, but is not limited to,
containment within duplex units, condominium units, apartment units,
manufactured homes and the like. This also includes residential dwellings upon
manufactured home communities or courts.
      (2)   For residential, commercial and industrial properties where the
overflow abatement charge is applicable pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, the
party that will be assessed and deemed responsible for the overflow abatement
charge will be determined utilizing utility billing information for such
property. The City will determine the responsible party for payment as being
the party contracting for any City utility service on said premises. The
primary contracted utility service to be used for identifying the responsible
party for payment will be the water meter utilized by the City for billing
purposes. Responsible parties for payment for properties without individual
water meters, such as where master meters are used, will be identified
utilizing other identifiable City utility services, such as electric meters. In
the case of commercial and industrial property, where no such contract or
meters exists, then the owner of the property, as identified by property tax
records found in the office of the Henry County (Ohio) Auditor, will be charged
as the responsible party for payment. In the event that impervious areas exist
in common areas, the owner of the common areas shall be the responsible party
for payment of those common areas.
   (e)   Rate.  An overflow abatement charge, charged in addition to the
capacity and commodity charge, is assessed monthly where the overflow abatement
charge is applicable pursuant to subsection (c) hereof. The overflow abatement
charge will incorporate a fee to serve as a just and equitable contribution to
the overflow abatement resolution and is calculated to reflect the estimated
amount of stormwater runoff created by such properties.
   The City has calculated the average impervious surface of a single-family
residential property within the City to be 3009 square feet. For purposes of
calculating the water abatement charge, one Equivalent Residential Unit (“ERU”)
shall herein be equal to 3009 square feet of impervious surface.
   Each residential property where the overflow abatement charge is applicable
pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, shall be assigned one ERU. The fee schedule
for residential properties is as established in this subsection (e).
   The total number of ERU’s of each commercial or industrial property where
the overflow abatement charge is applicable pursuant to subsection (c) hereof,
shall be calculated by determining the total square footage of impervious
surface on each such property and dividing that total by 3009. In no case shall
any commercial or industrial property have an ERU of less than one. The fee
schedule for commercial and industrial properties is as established in this
subsection (e).
   The total square footage of impervious surface shall be measured by the City
based on the records of the City Engineer, or through field examination or
photo grammetric analysis; provided, however, that the owners of properties
which are proposed for subdivision and/or development after the date of the
adoption of this section shall include on all preliminary plan and final plan
drawings submitted to the City in connection with the plan approval process, a
certification as to the total square footage of impervious surface to be
located on the property upon its development. Impervious area, as ascertained
in this section shall be reported to the Utility Department, including any
known changes thereto.
   Regardless of any provision to the contrary, the Napoleon City area school
district may, solely for the purpose of this overflow abatement charge, have
all properties that are utilized for public education aggregated as one.
   Effective with the first billing cycle in January in the year 2007, to be
reflected in the January 1st billing of the year 2007, and for each billing
cycle thereafter, the following rate structure shall be charged monthly as
follows:
   Residential Property
 
Inside Corporation Limits:  $9.50
Outside Corporation Limits: $14.25
   Commercial and Industrial Property
Tier ERU*
Corp. Limit Inside
Corp. Limit Outside
Less than   3.0            $9.50   $14.25
One         3.0 - 8.9      $20.00  $30.00
Two         9.0 - 16.9     $48.00  $72.00
Three       17.0 - 26.9    $90.00  $135.00
Four        27.0 - 47.9    $134.00 $201.00
Five        48.0 - 89.9    $248.00 $372.00
Six         90.0 and above $330.00 $495.00
   * ERU is calculated to the nearest one-tenth.
   (f)   Credit and Reduction.
      (1)   Commercial and industrial properties - Runoff is dramatically
increased by the impervious surfaces created by development, such as buildings
and pavement; however, some commercial and industrial properties where the
overflow abatement charge is applicable pursuant to subsection (c) hereof have
facilities on-site that reduce the amount or intensity of storm water that is
discharged to the City’s storm water collection system. In order to be
equitable and encourage future detention or retention to eliminate overflow
conditions, these properties may be granted a reduction of up to eighty percent
(80%) of their calculated ERU’s, subject to approval of an application made by
the responsible party for payment to be submitted to the City Utility
Department to be approved by the City Manager. In the case of multiple
responsible parties for payment applying for credit in regard to common
detention or retention, the City Manager may prorate said credit at any time.
      (2)   Multiple-level building reduction - In the case of multiple-level,
multiple- unit buildings that contain at least one single family unit wherein
one or more single family units occupy some or all of the space above or below
another residential, commercial, or industrial unit, the responsible party for
payment, as it applies to only the residential portion, may be granted a
reduction of up to fifty percent (50%) of the overflow abatement charge,
subject to approval of an application made by the responsible party for payment
to the City Utility Department and approved by the City Manager.
   (g)   Appeal.
      (1)   Commercial and industrial properties - If a responsible party for
payment feels that said responsible party for payment is entitled to credit or
greater credit than conferred pursuant to subsection (f)(1) hereof, the
responsible party may appeal to the City Manager, in writing, to see if a
credit or greater credit is warranted. Appeals should be made in accordance
with the established policies and procedures of the Water and Sewer Rules, Rule
26. The appeal must provide a discussion of the reason for the credit or
additional credit, documentation, including hydraulic calculations, and must be
in conformance with the City’s engineering standards. No more than an eighty
percent (80%) ERU credit will be given to any commercial or industrial
property.
      (2)   Multiple level buildings - If a responsible party for payment feels
that said responsible party is entitled to a reduction in fees, pursuant to
subsection (f)(2) hereof, the responsible party may appeal to the City Manager,
in writing, to see if a reduction is warranted. Appeals should be made in
accordance with the established policies and procedures of the Water and Sewer
Rules, Rule 26. No more than a fifty percent (50%) reduction in the overflow
abatement charge will be given to any residential unit.
      (3)   Subject to approval of application by the City Manager, a
responsible party may be granted such credit or reduction in fees retroactively
for up to sixty days prior to the application submission date, but the credit
or reduction is not to precede the effective date of this section.
   (h)   Conflict with Rules for Water and Sewer Service. Where a conflict
arises between this section and the Rules for Water and Sewer Service, this
section shall control.
   (i)   Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, all buildings and land
owned by this municipality are exempt from the overflow abatement charge;
moreover, any overflow abatement charge billed to this municipality is exempt
from collection.
(Ord. 023-07. Passed 3-19-07.)
   931.13 SEWER LATERAL CHARGE.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the sewer lateral charge, that is charged in
addition to the overflow abatement charge, capacity charge, and commodity
charge, is as follows:
      (1)   To raise revenue to offset the costs of assuming repairs to
customer sewer laterals which occur at or between the right-of-way and the
main.
      (2)    By assuming those costs, the City benefits by having more control
over who does work and how the work is being done to sewer lines that are in
the right-of-way to the main, which may include going under City streets.
      (3)   To improve the public health, safety, and welfare and providing for
the safe and efficient delineation of the sewer lateral responsibility.
 
   (b)   Rules. The City of Napoleon Water and Sewer Rules, and as amended from
time to time, are established to assist in decisions regarding this charge.
 
   (c)   Application of Charge. This charge will be considered a sanitary sewer
lateral fee is to be charged, in addition to any overflow abatement, capacity,
or commodity charge, to any real property that currently or in the future has
been determined to qualify for the Overflow Abatement Fee. The responsible
party for payment will be the same as the responsible party for the Overflow
Abatement Fee.
 
   (d)   Rates. The Sewer Lateral Charge is assessed monthly as follows:
 
Class User:                 Charge:
Residential - In            $2.10

   The City Manager may initiate an Energy Reduction Program to users of
electricity having an account classification of commercial, large power or
industrial customers whereby credits shall be applied to the customer’s
electrical invoice, up to 1/2% per 100 KW of pre-selected and approved
reduction of electricity use during a rolling 12 continuous month period basis,
in return for reduction of electrical consumption by the customer at times of
approach of a peaking condition, during an electrical peak condition, or when

(base price) plus $0.002 per kWh (to be retained by the City) for a total of
$0.007 per kWh. The customer can have participation levels (“usage breaks”) of
50% (fifty percent) and 100% (one hundred percent).
(Ord. 055-12. Passed 9-4-12.)
 
   939.05 NET METERING.
   (a)    Net Metering. Net Metering means measuring the difference between the
electricity supplied over the electric distribution system (power grid) and the
electricity generated by the consumer's solar power system which is fed back
into the electric distribution system over a specific billing period.
   (b)    Availability of Service. Net Metering is available to qualifying
consumers on a first come, first served basis, until the nameplate capacity of
all participating generators is equal to the maximum program limit of three
percent (3.0%) of the system peak demand of all customers during the previous
calendar year. The City Manager reserves the right to deny any consumer, for
any reason, the ability to enter into a net metering agreement with the City.
   (c)    Conditions of Service.
      (1)   A qualifying consumer is one whose generating facility complies
with all the following requirements:
         A.   Is owned and operated by the consumer and is located on the
consumer-generator's premises;
         B.   Is designed and installed to operate in parallel with the City's
Electric System without adversely affecting the operation of equipment and
service of the City and its consumers and without presenting safety hazards to
City and consumer personnel; and
         C.   Is intended primarily to offset part or all of the consumer-
generator's electricity needs.
      (2)   The consumer's generating equipment:
         A.   Shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's
specifications as well as all applicable provisions of the National Electrical
Code. All equipment and installations shall comply with all applicable safety
and performance standards established by the National Electrical Code, the
Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, and Underwriters
Laboratories.
         B.   Shall be installed in compliance with the Standards for
Interconnection and Parallel Operation of Small-Scaled, Customer-Owned Solar,
Wind, Hydroelectric or Fuel Cell Powered Generating Facilities up to 25kW
(residential) or 100 kW (commercial/industrial), and with all applicable
requirements of Wood County Building Inspection (inside corporation limits) or
Napoleon Power and Light (outside corporation limits).
      (3)   An application for interconnection with the City's distribution
system must be made by the consumer or the consumer's authorized
representative. The interconnection permit must provide at least the following
information regarding the consumer-generator's facility: Inverter type, array
size, certification, and manufacturer's specifications including details about
circuit protective devices; generation facility certifications; the installing
electrician name, address, and phone number; and proof of inspection and
approval from the appropriate City inspector(s).
   (d)   Metering. Net energy metering shall be accomplished using a single
meter capable of registering the flow of electricity in each direction. If the
existing electrical meter installed at the consumer's facility is not capable
of measuring the flow of electricity in two directions, the consumer shall be
responsible for all expenses for the purchase and installation of an
appropriate meter with such capability. The City may, at the consumer's or the
city's expense and with written consent of the consumer, install one or more
additional meters to monitor the flow of electricity.
   (e)   Rate. At the end of the billing period a calculation will be made to
determine the difference, if any, between the amount of kWh supplied to the
consumer from the city's system and the amount of kWh supplied to the city's
system from the consumer.
      (1)   Credit: If the consumer generator's facility feeds more kWh of
electricity back to the City's system than the City supplies to the consumer,
at the same site, during the billing period, then fifty percent (50%) of the
excess kWh will be given as a kWh credit for the beginning of the next billing
period for the same site. At no time will the consumer be entitled to, nor
compensated for, any monetary payout of the excess electricity fed back to the
city's system.
      (2)   Billing Period: The billing period is January 1st through either
December 31st of each calendar year or the last day of the month in which the
consumer ceases operation of the net metering agreement, whichever comes first.
      (3)   For Example: At the end of the billing period it was determined
that consumer X's solar system delivered to the City's system 100 kWh, then
consumer X would receive a credit of 50 kWh for that same site.
   (f)   Special Terms and Conditions.
      (1)   Each consumer under a net meter system must carry a minimum of one
hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) in liability insurance naming the City
as an additional insured.
      (2)   The consumer-generator must install and maintain a manual
disconnect switch that will disconnect the net metering facility from the
Napoleon Utilities electric system. The disconnect switch must be a lockable,
load-break switch that plainly indicates whether it is in the open or closed
position. The disconnect switch must be readily accessible to Napoleon Utility
personnel at all times and located within ten (10) feet of the meter. The
disconnect switch may be located more than ten (10) feet from the billing meter
provided that permanent instructions are posted at the meter indicating the
precise location of the disconnect switch. This information must be indicated
on the application form and approved by the Utility.
   (g)   Additional Charges. The consumer shall pay any additional charges, as
determined by the City, for equipment, labor, metering, testing or inspections
that are requested by the consumer or needed by the City.
   (h)   Length of Term. Contracts under this schedule shall be automatically
renewed on January 1st of each year, unless either the consumer or the City
provides written notice to terminate the agreement within ten (10) calendar
days of the renewal.

approval of the plat with the variances without further necessity of separate
approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals, so long as the minimum notification is
given pursuant to Section

reduce any front, side, or rear setback of existing buildings to less than
required by this Planning and Zoning Code, or create a change in any zoning
district, shall be exempt from Planning Commission review, provided that notice

this Planning and Zoning Code, and an adequate legal description of the
property that is to be transferred is provided, along with other applicable
information as required by the Zoning Administrator, then the Zoning
Administrator shall in the name of the City sign the survey and release the
document for recording upon the payment of the review fee.
      (2)   The exception clause is intended to be used for the purpose of
straightening lot lines between unusually shaped parcels of land or

Zoning Administrator shall not approve transfer of land which will result in
odd or unusual shaped parcels of land or to avoid the subdivision regulations
of this chapter.

considered null and void if, within one year after the issuance of such
approval:
         A.   No substantial construction, erection, alteration, excavation,
demolition, or similar work is commenced on the site that is the subject of the
preliminary plat; or,
         B.   Less than ten (10) percent of the total cost of all construction,

         B.   The recipient of the preliminary plat approval has proceeded with
due diligence and in good faith, and conditions have not changed so
substantially as to warrant a new application. Successive extensions may be
granted for periods up to six (6) months upon the same findings. All such

1121.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide an orderly method to amend
regulations and districts. The regulations imposed and the districts created by
this Planning and Zoning Code may be amended from time to time by ordinance,
but no such amendments shall be made without a review by the Planning
Commission.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1121.02 APPLICATION FOR AMENDMENT.
   Applications for an amendment to this Planning and Zoning Code, including
the Zone Map, may be initiated by any property owner or agent of any property
owner, by the City administration, by the Planning Commission, or by the
Council, by filing an application for amendment with the Zoning Administrator.
The Zoning Administrator shall prepare a form and instructions as to what
information is necessary for an application for amendment.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1121.03 HEARING ON APPLICATION FOR AMENDMENT.
   Within 60 days of receipt of any application by the Zoning Administrator for
an amendment, the Planning Commission shall hold a hearing on such application
at such time and place as shall be established by the Planning Commission.
Notice of said hearing shall be given in accordance with the provision of
Section
159.03 of the Administrative Code; moreover, if the amendment proposed is to
rezone or redistrict ten (10) or less parcels of land, written notice of the
hearing shall be given to the owners of property within a two hundred foot
(200') radius from such parcel as listed on the tax duplicate. In addition, if
the amendment proposed is to rezone any property currently zoned as industrial,
then written notice shall be provided to all owners of such properties
currently zoned as industrial. Such notice shall be mailed by the Zoning
Administrator by first class mail to the address of such owners appearing on
the County Auditor's current tax list or the Finance Director's mailing list
and to such other list that may be specified by the Planning Commission at
least twenty (20) days before the date of the public hearing. The failure of
delivery of such notice shall not invalidate any such ordinance, measure, or
regulation. The Zoning Administrator shall cause to be made a search of the
records of the Henry County Recorder to determine the record owners. (Ord. 026-
16. Passed 9-6-16.)
      
1121.04 FINDINGS OF FACT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
   The Planning Commission shall cause to be made written findings of fact
regarding a proposed amendment and shall submit same together with its
recommendations to Council. The Planning Commission report to Council shall
indicate the vote of each member present and voting on every recommendation.
Any member of the Planning Commission that dissents from the majority regarding
a recommendation may make his or her dissention known, in writing, to be
submitted to the Council as part of the record. Where the purpose and effect of
the proposed amendment is to change the zoning classification of particular
property, the Planning Commission shall make findings based on the evidence
presented to it in each specific case with respect to the following matters:
   (a)   The zoning classification of property within the general area of the
property in question;
   (b)   Existing uses of property within the general area of the property in
question;
   (c)   The suitability of the property in question to the uses permitted
under the existing zoning classification;
   (d)   The trend of development, if any, in the general area of the property
in question, including changes, if any, which have taken place in its present
zoning classification; and
   (e)   Changed or changing conditions in the applicable area, or in the City
generally, that make the proposed zoning or amendment thereto reasonably
necessary to the promotion of the public health, safety, or general welfare.
   The Planning Commission shall not recommend the adoption of a proposed
amendment unless it finds that the adoption of such amendment is in the public
interest and is not solely for the interest of the petitioner or applicant,
except that no finding is required that “the amendment is not solely for the
interest of the petitioner or applicant” when an application is initiated by
the City Administration, by the Planning Commission, or by the Council. When
the petition for an amendment to the Zone Map is made by a property owner or
agent of a property owner, the Planning Commission may recommend the adoption
of an amendment changing the zoning classification of the property in question
to any higher classification than that requested by the petitioner. For the
purpose of this paragraph, the "R-1" Suburban Residential District shall be
considered the highest classification and the "I-2" Open Industrial District
shall be considered the lowest classification. When the petitioner is other
than the property owner or an agent of a property owner, then the Planning
Commission may recommend any different zone classification, higher or lower,
than that requested by the petitioner.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1121.05 ACTION BY THE CITY COUNCIL.
   The Council shall not act on a proposed amendment to this Planning and
Zoning Code until it has received a written report and recommendation from the
Planning Commission on the proposed amendment.
   On receipt of a written report and recommendation from the Planning
Commission, the Clerk of Council shall place such report, recommendation, and
ordinance for amendment on its agenda. Before any ordinance for amendment may
be passed, the Council shall hold a public hearing thereon as set by the Clerk
or by the Council as a whole, and shall give at least thirty (30) days notice
of time and place thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. If
the ordinance, measure, or regulation intends to rezone or redistrict ten (10)
or less parcels of land, as listed on the tax duplicate, written notice of the
hearing shall be mailed by the Zoning Administrator, by first class mail, at
least twenty (20) days before the date of the public hearing to the owners of
property, within a two hundred (200') foot radius from such parcel, to the
address of such owners appearing on the County Auditor's current tax list or
the Finance Director's mailing list and to such other list that may be
specified by Council. The failure of delivery of such notice shall not
invalidate any such ordinance, measure, or regulation.
   During such thirty (30) days the text or copy of the text of such ordinance,
measure, or regulation, together with the maps or plans, or copies thereof,
forming part of or referred to in such ordinance, measure, or regulation and
the maps, plans, and written report submitted by the Planning Commission, shall
be on file for public examination, in the office of the Zoning Administrator.
Approval or disapproval of any amendment to this Planning and Zoning Code by
Council shall be in accordance with Section
159.02(b) of the Administrative Code.
   If a manifest error be discovered in this Planning and Zoning Code
consisting of the misspelling of any word or words, the omission of any word or
words necessary to express the intention of the provisions affected, the use of
a word or words to which no meaning can be attached, or the use of a word or
words when another word or words were clearly intended to express the intent,
the spelling shall be corrected, and the word or words supplied, omitted, or
substituted as will conform with the manifest intention, and the provision
shall have the same effect as though the correct words were contained in the
text as originally published. No alteration shall be made or permitted if any
question exists regarding the nature or extent of the error.

1125.03 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the
Official Zone Map, the following rules shall apply:
   (a)   Centerlines of Streets and Boundaries. Unless otherwise indicated, the
district boundary lines are the centerlines of streets, rights-of-way,
parkways, alleys or railroad rights-of-way, or such lines extended.
   (b)   Boundaries. Boundaries indicated as approximately following section
line limits, half-section and quarter-section lines, City corporate limit
lines, or platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lines.
   (c)   Railroad Lines. Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall
be construed to be midway between the main tracks. The official railroad
drawings shall establish the railroad boundaries.
   (d)   Shore Lines and Water Ways. Boundaries indicated as following shore
lines shall be construed to follow such shore lines, and in the event of change
in the shore line shall be construed as moving with the actual shore line;
boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streams,
rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow
such center lines.
   (e)   Use of Scale on Zone Map. Boundaries indicated as parallel to or
extensions of features indicated in subsections (a) to (d) inclusive above
shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the Official
Zone Map shall be determined by the scale of the map.
   (f)   Boundaries Determined by Board. Where physical or cultural features
existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the Official Zone
Map, or in other circumstances not covered by this section, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall interpret the district boundaries and order an official survey.
      (Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1125.04 LOTS DIVIDED BY DISTRICT LINES.
   (a)   Whenever a single lot two (2) acres or less in size is located within
two (2) or more different zoning districts, the district regulations applicable
to the district within the larger portion of where the lot lies shall apply to
the entire lot.
   (b)   Whenever a single lot greater than two (2) acres in size is located
within two (2) or more different zoning districts, each portion of that lot
shall be subject to all the regulations applicable to the district in which it
is located.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)

(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1127.15 NOISE.
   (a)   No person in any commercial district may generate noise or permit
noise to be generated that tends to have an annoying or disruptive effect upon
others within or outside the district regardless if the noise so generated is a
result of one or more uses upon the lot within the commercial district.
   (b)   No person in any industrial district may generate or cause to be
generated noise in excess of that as established in subsection (c) of this
section.
   (c)   Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, the table set
forth in subsection (f) of this section establishes the maximum permissible
noise levels in the I-1 and I-2 districts. Measurements shall be taken at the
boundary line of the lot where the enterprise or enterprises that are
generating the noise are located; however, as indicated, the maximum
permissible noise levels may vary according to the zoning of the lot adjacent
to the industrial zoned lot on which the enterprise or enterprises that are
generating the noise are located.
   (d)   A decibel is a measure of a unit of sound pressure. Since sound waves
having the same decibel level "sound" louder or softer to the human ear
depending upon the frequency of the sound wave in cycles-per-second (i.e.,
whether the pitch of the sound is high or low) and A- weighted filter
constructed in accordance with the specifications of the American National
Standards Institute, which automatically takes into account the varying effect
on the human ear of different pitches, shall be used on any sound level meter
taking measurements required by this section and accordingly, any measurements
are expressed in dB(A) to reflect the use of this A- weighted filter.
   (e)   The standards established in the table are set forth in subsection (f)
of this section and expressed in terms of the Equivalent Sound Level (Leq),
which must be calculated by taking 100 instantaneous A-weighted sound levels at
10 second intervals.

   (g)   Impact noises are sounds that occur intermittently rather than
continuously. Impact noises generated by sources that do not operate more than
one minute in any one-hour period are permissible up to a level of 10 dB(A) in
excess of the figures listed in subsection (f) of this section, except that
this higher level of permissible noise shall not apply from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.
when the adjacent lot is zoned residential. The impact noise shall be measured
using the fast response of the sound level meter.

   (a)   No person in any commercial district may generate or cause to be
generated any ground-transmitted vibration that is perceptible to the human
sense of touch measured at (i) the outside boundary of the immediate space
occupied by the enterprise generating the vibration if the enterprise is one of
several located on a lot, or (ii) the lot line if the enterprise generating the
vibration is the only enterprise located on a lot.
   (b)   No person in an I-1 or I-2 district may generate or cause to be
generated any ground-transmitted vibration in excess of the limits set forth in
subsection (e) of this section. Vibration shall be measured at any adjacent lot
line or residential district line as indicated in the table set forth in
subsection (e) of this section.
   (c)   The instrument used to measure vibrations shall be a three-component
measuring system capable of simultaneous measurement of vibration in three
mutually perpendicular directions.
   (d)   The vibration maximums set forth in subsection (e) of this section are
stated in terms of particle velocity, which may be measured directly with
suitable instrumentation or computed on the basis of displacement and
frequency. When computed, the following formula shall be used: PV = 6.28 F x D,
Where: PV = Particle Velocity, Inches-Per-Second, F = Vibration Frequency,
Cycles-Per-Second, D = Single Amplitude Displacement of the Vibration, Inches.
The maximum velocity shall be the vector sum of the three components recorded.

1127.20 SATELLITE ANTENNAS, MICROWAVE ANTENNAS AND EQUIPMENT.
   (a)   SCOPE. This section of the Planning and Zoning Code regulates the
installation of satellite antennas, microwave antennas, other microwave
equipment and microwave transmitting and relay stations in all zoning districts
within the City.
   (b)   FINDINGS AND DECLARATION. The Planning Commission and Council
recognize that this section may be preempted under 47 CFR 25.104; however, the
Planning Commission and Council finds that the installation of satellite and
microwave antennas and equipment can, unless controlled, affect the aesthetic
and safety values of agricultural, residential, commercial and industrial
areas. Therefore, the installation of those antennas and equipment is regulated
to result in locations which are least visible from public rights-of-way in the
vicinity, while not burdening adjacent property owners with adverse visual
impacts. The Planning Commission and Council do hereby declare that the purpose
of adopting this Part of the Planning and Zoning Code is to protect the
aesthetic integrity and safety values of neighborhoods within the City. The
City has adopted regulations which provide for such aesthetic and safety
protection while placing the least possible restrictions or limitations upon
the legitimate ability of residents to avail themselves of the current and
future satellite and microwave technology. The Planning Commission and Council
have knowingly and intentionally provided for restrictions on such aspects of
satellite and microwave antennas as to color and location and roof mounting
because those aspects of regulation relate directly to aesthetic and safety
considerations which are important to all residents of the City, not just those
who choose to avail themselves of the technology of satellite and microwave
technology, and those aspects of regulation are deemed not to interfere
unreasonably with the right of a homeowner or business owner to avail himself
or herself of, and to receive, said technology.
   (c)   SATELLITE ANTENNAS. A satellite antenna or microwave receiving
antenna, as defined in Section
1101.01 may be installed in any zoning district, as an accessory use. Each such
antenna shall comply with the following criteria:
      (1)   A setback equal to the height of the antenna or the setback which
applies to the principal structure, whichever is greater, is required between
the property line and any part of the antenna. In addition, installation is
prohibited between any street and principal building on the site except as
provided in paragraph (2) below.
      (2)   In any case where a lot backs up to a public right-of-way or
private street, a setback of 15 feet is required between the public right-of-
way or the curb of a private street and any portion of the satellite antenna.
      (3)   The maximum height of the antenna shall be 12 feet measured from
ground level immediately under the antenna to the highest point of the antenna
or any appurtenance attached to it.
      (4)   All wires or cables necessary for the operation of the antenna or
reception of the signal shall be placed underground except those wires or
cables attached flush with the surface of a building.
      (5)   An antenna may not be installed with the use of guy wires.
      (6)   An antenna may not have a highly reflective surface or color. In
addition, colors shall be subdued.
      (7)   No more than one (1) antenna is allowed on a parcel.
      (8)   An application for architectural review shall be filed by the
property owner or his or her duly authorized agent in a form and manner
prescribed by the Zoning Administrator. An applicant shall file, with the
Zoning Administrator, a site plan and landscaping plan and other related data
which may be required.
      (9)   Landscaping or solid screening shall be installed around an antenna
to screen it from adjacent public streets, public areas of the development or
adjacent properties. No such screening is required when the antenna is located
so that it is not visible from adjacent public streets, public areas of the
development or adjacent properties.
      (10)   Additional landscape screening shall be installed around an
antenna located in a hillside area where visibility from surrounding area is
greater.
      (11)   A satellite antenna may not be installed on the roof of a
structure, unless structural integrity is provided by an applicable Engineer
with the application.
      (12)   An antenna shall be maintained in an operational state with no
structural defects or visible damage.
      (13)   The design and location of the satellite antenna must be approved
by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall consider the
application for compliance and may require such plans and supplemental
information as may be needed to review the application. The following criteria
shall be considered:
         A.   Whether or not the aesthetic and safety values of agricultural,
residential, commercial and industrial areas have been adequately protected.
         B.   Whether or not there has been compliance with all rules,
regulations and codes.
         C.   Whether or not the placement is least visible from public rights-
of- way in the vicinity, while not burdening adjacent property owners with
adverse visual impacts.
   (d)   MICROWAVE RECEIVING ANTENNAS. Microwave receiving antenna installation
shall comply with the following criteria:
      (1)   A microwave receiving antenna installed in a residential zoning
district or residential area of a planned unit district shall comply with the
following:
         A.   The antenna may not exceed 48 inches in diameter and shall be
mounted on a building or roof.
         B.   If installed on a roof, the highest point of the antenna may not
be higher than the diameter of the antenna above the roof surface directly
under the antenna.
         C.   All wires or cable necessary for the operation of the antenna or
reception of the signal shall be placed underground when wires are extended
past the primary building where the antenna is placed, except those wires or
cables attached flush with the surface of a building.
      (2)   A microwave receiving antenna installed in any nonresidential
zoning district or nonresidential portion of a planned unit district shall
comply with the following:
         A.   Installation is prohibited in any required front or street side
yard setback area.
         B.   All wires or cables necessary for the operation of the antenna or
reception of the signal shall be placed underground, except those wires or
cables attached flush with the surface of the building.
         C.   An antenna may not be installed with the use of guy wires.

1127.21 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES.
   (a)   PURPOSE. These regulations are established to provide for the
construction and use of Wireless Telecommunication Facilities in the City. The
regulations allow Wireless Telecommunication Facilities as a permitted use,
conditional use, or accessory use depending upon the specific land areas of the
City in which, and circumstances under which, they are proposed to be located.
The purpose of these regulations is to balance the competing interests created
by the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104, codified at
47 U.S.C. §§151 et seq.) and the interests of the City in regulating Wireless
Telecommunication Facilities for the following reasons:
      (1)   To provide for orderly development within the City;
      (2)   To protect property values;
      (3)   To maintain the aesthetic appearance of the City, including, but
not limited to, its unique residential character, historic character,
unobstructed open spaces and attractive commercial/office areas;
      (4)   To protect residential properties, open spaces and the nonintensive
commercial zoning districts which are characteristic of the City from the
adverse effects of Towers and related Facilities;
      (5)   To promote Collocation of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities in
order to decrease the total number of Towers in the City;
      (6)   To provide for and protect the health, safety and general welfare
of the residents and visitors of the City; and
      (7)   To maintain, where possible, the integrity of the existing zoning
regulations contained in this Planning and Zoning Code.
   The regulations established a hierarchy of acceptable land areas for the
location of Wireless Telecommunication Facilities through the establishment of
such use as a permitted use in certain zoning districts or as a conditional use
in certain zoning districts for erection of Antennas only, which determination
is dependent upon the location and characteristics of such land areas.
   Where applicable, the regulations governing the Wireless Telecommunications
Facilities shall control and supersede wherever they are inconsistent with
other provisions of this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (b)   As used in this chapter, the definitions found in Section
1101.01 shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
   (c)   APPLICABILITY. No person shall construct, erect, maintain, extend or
remove a Wireless Telecommunication Facility in the City without compliance
with the provisions of this Section.
   (d)   USE REGULATIONS.
      (1)   Permitted use.
         A.   A Wireless Telecommunication Tower shall be permitted in all
Districts so long as acquiring a conditional use permit and meeting the zoning
requirements.
      (2)   Conditional use.
         A.   Antennas. The erection or construction of a Wireless
Telecommunication Antenna(s) on an existing Wireless Telecommunication Tower
may be permitted as a conditional use as a Collocation on such a Tower provided
that all electronic and relay equipment for the Wireless Telecommunication
Antenna shall be housed within the existing Equipment Shelter or as such
Shelter may be expanded. Such use may be approved by the Planning Commission
upon submission of an application to the Zoning Administrator which meets all
applicable regulations of this section related to the placement of the Wireless
Telecommunication Equipment and related Facilities associated with such Antenna
(s).
         B.   Towers. A Wireless Telecommunication Tower may be permitted as a
permitted or conditional use only in the areas indicated in this Planning and
Zoning Code, unless a variance is approved. Such use may be approved by the
Planning Commission upon submission of an application to the Zoning
Administrator, provided the applicant demonstrates compliance with each of the
following Collocation requirements in this section, as well as the standards
set forth in Provision (e) of this section.
         C.   Collocation Requirements.
            1.   Construction of a Wireless Telecommunications Tower will only
be considered as a Conditional Use under subsection (d)(2)B. where the
applicant demonstrates, in addition to any other specified required criteria,
that there is no Technically Suitable space for the applicant’s Antenna(s) and
related Facilities reasonably available on an existing Tower, building or
structure within the geographic area to be served. With the application, the
applicant shall list the location of every Tower, building or structure that
could support the proposed Antenna(s) or area where it would be Technically
Suitable to locate so as to allow it to serve its intended function. The
applicant must demonstrate that a Technically Suitable location is not
reasonably available on an existing Tower, building or structure. If another
existing Tower, building or structure is Technically Suitable, the applicant
must demonstrate that it has requested to Collocate on the existing Tower,
building or structure and the Collocation request was rejected by the owner of
the Tower, building or structure. In all circumstances, owners of existing
Towers shall promptly respond in writing to requests for Collocation, but in no
event shall they respond more than thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of
a written request for Collocation. If another Tower, building or structure is
Technically Suitable, the applicant must further show that it has offered to
allow the owner of that other Tower, building or structure to Collocate an
Antenna(s) on another Tower, building or structure within the City which is
owned or controlled by the applicant, if any, on reasonably reciprocal terms
and the offer was not accepted.
            2.   All applicants for construction or erection of Wireless
Telecommunication Towers shall be required to construct on a base Tower
structure and structure foundation that is designed to be buildable up to, but
not including two hundred (200) feet above grade. Such structure shall be
designed to have sufficient structural loading capacity to accommodate at least
four (4) Antenna platforms or Antenna arrays of equal loading capacity for four
(4) separate providers of service to be located on the structure when
constructed to the maximum allowable height. The Wireless Telecommunication
Facility shall also be designed to show that the applicant has enough space on
its site plan for an Equipment Shelter large enough to accommodate at least
four (4) separate users of the Facility. If an Equipment Shelter is initially
constructed to accommodate fewer than four (4) users, space shall be reserved
on site for Equipment Shelter expansions to accommodate up to at least four (4)
separate users. Agreement to the provisions of this subsection must be included
in the applicant’s lease with the landowner, if different from the owner/user
of the Tower. Written documentation must be presented to the Zoning
Administrator evidencing that the landowner of the property on which the Tower
is to be located has agreed to the terms of this subsection. As an additional
condition of issuing a conditional use permit, the owner/user shall respond in
writing to any inquiries regarding Collocation of another user of the Facility
within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written inquiry. Copies of all
written requests to Collocate and all written responses shall be sent to the
Zoning Administrator.

Nonconforming uses - see Ohio R.C. 713.15
 
1129.01 PURPOSE AND ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to recognize the existence of uses,
buildings, lots, and structures that lawfully existed at the time of this
Planning and Zoning Code enactment, for amendments thereto, but which now does
not conform to one or more of the regulations contained in this Planning and
Zoning Code. Such nonconforming status shall be permitted to continue only in
conformance with this chapter. The provisions are intended to encourage greater
compliance with this Planning and Zoning Code in the short term and eliminate
nonconforming uses in the long term.
   (b)   The Zoning Administrator shall determine if a use, lot, structure, or
site is less nonconforming than another use, lot, structure, or site based upon
criteria such as land use intensity, required parking spaces, trip generation,
potential nuisances, setbacks, bulk, or other criteria relevant to the intent
of this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (c)   An applicant and/or owner of property that deals with nonconformity
shall bear the burdon of proof in demonstrating that the use was a legal
nonconformity on the effective date of this Planning and Zoning Code.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1129.02 CONTINUATION OF NONCONFORMING USES AND COMPLETION OF NONCONFORMING
PROJECTS.
   (a)   Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Planning and Zoning
Code and subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in Sections
1129.03 to
1129.07, nonconforming uses that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of
this Planning and Zoning Code may be continued.
   (b)   Nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
   (c)   Nonconforming uses as a result of annexation shall be treated as a
legal nonconforming use so long as it was otherwise legal under the township
zoning immediately prior to annexation.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1129.03 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (a)   When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all
regulations applicable to the intended use, except that the lot is smaller than
the required minimums set forth in Chapters
1131 to
1137, then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming.
   (b)   When the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is
conforming in all other respects but the applicable setback requirements cannot
reasonably be complied with, then the Board of Zoning Appeals may allow
deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that:
      (1)   The property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed
without such deviations.
      (2)   These deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the
nonconforming lot, and
      (3)   The property can be developed as proposed without any significantly
adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety.
   (c)   For the purposes of subsection (b), compliance with applicable
building setback requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that
serves the minimal needs of the use proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot
practicably be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with such
setback requirements. However, mere financial hardship does not constitute
grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible.
   (d)   This section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots. A lot is
undeveloped if it has no substantial structures on it. A change in the use of a
developed nonconforming lot may be accomplished in accordance with Section
1129.06.
   (e)   If an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous
frontage with one (1) or more other undeveloped lots under the same ownership,
then neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor his or her successors in
interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section. This subsection
shall not apply to a nonconforming lot if a majority of the developed lots
located on either side of the street that are within 500 feet where such lot is
located are also nonconforming. The intent of this subsection is to require
nonconforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to create
conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein, but not to require
such combination when that would be out of character with the way the
neighborhood has previously been developed.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1129.04 EXTENSION OR ENLARGEMENT OF NONCONFORMING USE PROHIBITED.
   (a)   Except as specifically provided in this Planning and Zoning Code, no
person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of a
nonconforming use.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1129.05 REPAIR, MAINTENANCE AND RECONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   On any nonconforming structure or portion thereof containing a
nonconforming use, ordinary repairs and routine maintenance to the structure
and property is allowed; provided however, that the cubic content existing when
it became nonconforming is not increased.
   (b)   Should the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion thereof be
damaged by more than fifty percent of its fair market value, as estimated by a
professionally recognized or certified appraiser, by fire, neglect, or by an
act of God, it may, only after a zoning permit is issued, be reconstructed as
it previously existed and restored on the same building footprint. All
remaining debris shall be cleared away and disposed of properly within two
months of the time of destruction. The nonconforming structure may be restored
on the same footprint, provided such restoration begins two months after the
damage occurred and is completed by the time period designated in the zoning
permit.
   (c)   The Zoning Administrator shall issue a permit if he or she finds that
in completing the renovation, repair, or replacement work that the permittee
will comply to the extent reasonably possible with all provisions of this
Planning and Zoning Code.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1129.06 CHANGE IN USE OF PROPERTY WHERE A NONCONFORMING USE EXISTS.
   (a)   A change in use of property (where a nonconforming use exists) that is
sufficiently substantial as to require a new zoning or conditional-use permit
in accordance with Chapter
1141 may not be made except in accordance with subsections (b) through (d) of
this section. However, this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit
is needed.
   (b)   If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is
permissible in the district where the property is located, and all of the other
requirements of the Planning and Zoning Code applicable to that use can be
complied with, permission to make the change must be obtained in the same
manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot. Once conformity
with this Planning and Zoning Code is achieved, the property may not revert to
its nonconforming status.
   (c)   If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is
permissible in the district where the property is located, but all of the
requirements of this Planning and Zoning Code applicable to that use cannot
reasonably be complied with, then the change is permissible if the entity
authorized by this Planning and Zoning Code to issue a permit for that
particular use finds, in addition to any other findings that may be required by
this Planning and Zoning Code, that:
      (1)   The intended change will not result in a violation of Section
1129.04; and
      (2)   All of the applicable requirements of this Planning and Zoning Code
that can reasonably be complied with will be mandated compliance (compliance
with a requirement of this Planning and Zoning Code is not reasonably possible
if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot
where the nonconforming situation is maintained or without moving a substantial
structure that is on a permanent foundation). Mere financial hardship caused by
the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute
grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible.
   (d)   If the intended change in use is to another principal use that is also
nonconforming, then the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this
Planning and Zoning Code to authorize the issuance of a permit for that
particular use finds, in addition to other findings that may be required by
this Planning and Zoning Code, that:
      (1)   The use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning
district with either a zoning or conditional-use permit; and
      (2)   All of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in
subsection (c) of this section are satisfied; and
      (3)   The proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on
those most affected by it and will be more compatible with the surrounding
neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the permit is applied for
issuance.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1129.07 ABANDONMENT AND DISCONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)   Nonconforming land use, structure, or portion thereof, shall not be
reinstated if it is discontinued for a period of six consecutive months.
Thereafter any use of the premises shall conform to the use regulations of the
district in which the property is located. The intent to continue a
nonconforming use shall not be assumed to be evidence of its continuance.
   (b)   Nonconforming land use, structure, or portion thereof, that has been
made conforming shall not be made nonconforming.
   (c)   When a structure or operation is made nonconforming by the enactment
of this Planning and Zoning Code or any amendment thereto, and the structure
thereafter becomes vacant or the operation is discontinued, the six consecutive
month period for purposes of this section shall begin at time the vacancy
occurs or the operation is discontinued.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1129.08 NONCONFORMING PROJECT PERMITS.
   (a)   All nonconforming projects on which application for a zoning permit
was issued may proceed under this Planning and Zoning Code in existence at the
time of application so long as these permits were validly issued and unexpired.
A zoning permit issued under this chapter expires one (1) year after date of
issuance.
   (b)   The Zoning Administrator shall establish expedited procedures for
hearing applications for permits under this section. (Procedures listed
previously in this Planning and Zoning Code under Board of Zoning Appeals and/
or Planning Commission whichever apply, shall be the established procedures).

1133.01 COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.
   The following commercial districts are hereby established:
   (a)   C-1,
   (b)   C-2,
   (c)   C-3,
   (d)   C-4, and
   (e)   C-5.
   These districts are created to accomplish the purposes and serve the
objectives set forth in the remainder of this section.
   (a)   The C-1 GENERAL COMMERCIAL DISTRICT is intended to serve as the
primary business district (Downtown Business District) of the community, where
a full range of goods and services are offered and where the greatest land use
intensity is located. This District is the focal point for community
identification, highly accessible to the entire trade area, and designed
primarily for pedestrian- oriented services.
   (b)   The C-2 COMMUNITY COMMERCIAL DISTRICT is intended primarily to
accommodate commercial development on a scale less intensive than the C-
1 GENERAL COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. A lesser intensity of development is achieved
through setback, height, and minimum lot size requirements that are more
restrictive than those applied in the C-1 zone. The types of businesses
permissible in these zones are generally similar to the types permissible in a
C-1 zone. These zones provide a transition in some areas between a C-1 zone and
a residential zone or may provide for a smaller scale business that primarily
serves one neighborhood or area of the City as opposed to a regional area of
the City. The dimensional restrictions in the zone are also designed to
encourage, in appropriate areas, the renovation for commercial purposes of
buildings that formerly were single-family dwellings.
   (c)   The C-3 LOCAL COMMERCIAL DISTRICT is intended primarily for office
uses, personal services uses, and retail services which dispense goods and
services directly to consumers. This district is designed to serve residential
neighborhoods with a highly varied grouping of indoor business services which
are not generators of heavy traffic.
   (d)   The C-4 PLANNED COMMERCIAL DISTRICT is designed to encourage well-
planned commercial uses, particularly with respect to unified design, safe
ingress and egress, and adequate and properly located parking and service
facilities, along with convenient and safe pedestrian accessibility.
   (e)   The C-5 HIGHWAY COMMERCIAL DISTRICT is intended to accommodate
commercial activities that draw business primarily from and provide services to
highways.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1133.02 GENERAL COMMERCIAL DISTRICT PROHIBITIONS.
   In any Commercial District, the following prohibitions shall supplement the
regulations set forth in the district regulations.
   (a)   Lights utilizing flashing devices, unshielded incandescent lamps, or
attention- attracting lighting from apparatus of a type used by emergency
vehicles will not be permitted on any premises in a Commercial District.
   (b)   Exterior displays which restrict visibility or which impede the
movement of pedestrians or motor vehicles shall not be permitted on public
property within a Commercial District.
   (c)   Large trash containers (roll-offs), or large donation boxes (more than
2 foot square) shall not be installed or maintained within view of the public
street or thoroughfare.
   (d)   Vending machines shall not be permitted in the front of any building
unless set back five feet or more from the property line.

detached building or structure shall be located on a zoning lot.

1137.01 FLOOD PLAIN AND FLOODWAY DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.
   (a)   The FP FLOODPLAIN AND FLOODWAY DISTRICTS are hereby established as
"overlay" districts, meaning that these districts are overlaid upon other
districts and the land so encumbered may be used in a manner permitted in the
underlying district only to the extent such use is also permitted in the
applicable overlay district. The FP Floodplain and Floodway District is
intended for those areas adjoining any waterway which have been or may be
expected hereafter to be covered by flood water, as determined by historical
and technical studies. The FP Floodplain and Floodway District is created to
protect the public health and safety, and to reduce the financial burdens which
may be imposed on the community as a result of the improper use of lands having
excessively high water tables or which are subject to periodic flooding.
   (b)   Performance Standards for Existing Uses.
      (1)   Maintenance and repair work may be accomplished that will protect
the existing structure and will not create additional flood hazard on the
premises.
      (2)   Subject to established height restrictions in the zone district,
additions may be constructed to existing buildings if the new addition
foundation top is one foot above the flood plain elevation.
      (3)   New additions not greater than 10% of the existing floor area may
be constructed at the same elevation as the existing foundation structure if
the new addition will not add to the flood hazard on the premises.
   (c)    Flood Plain and Floodway District Conditional Uses.
      (1)   New buildings or major additions to existing buildings shall be
constructed with the lowest floor elevation three feet above flood height.
Basements shall not be approved with openings below the flood height elevation.
      (2)   Any structures permitted shall be so located as to offer minimum
obstruction to the flow of water.
      (3)   Filling and re-grading land shall be permitted if the proposed
filling and grading is approved by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources
and/or any other governmental agency having jurisdiction.
      (4)   All developments shall have engineered plans and procedures and
demonstrate proper plats.
      (5)   Applications for a flood plain conditional use permit shall be
filed with the Zoning Administrator containing the following information:
         A.   A survey by an Ohio registered land surveyor of the zoning lot
proposed for use, including the entire area proposed to be used for the
development.
         B.   A site plan indicating the arrangement and location of each
building on the premises. The site plan shall also include a topographic survey
having contour lines shown on a five foot interval.
         C.   The flood plain development requests shall be examined and
evaluated by the Planning Commission in the terms of conformance with the
regulations stated herein, and may recommend approval only after a
determination has been made that the proposed development complies with the
regulation of this Planning and Zoning Code.

1138.01 DEFINITIONS. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR’S NOTE: See Definitions in Section
1101.01.)
1138.02 CREATION OF PRESERVATION DISTRICT.
   Council hereby declares as a matter of public policy that distinctive areas
of the City where structures tend to be more than fifty (50) years of age
exemplify a predominant architectural style, possess historical significance,
and/or portray the early development of the City collectively contribute to the
economic, cultural, and educational development of the City; further, Council
hereby declares as a matter of public policy that the preservation and
enhancement of such historic buildings and areas in the City is a public
necessity and is required in the interest of the health, safety, and welfare of
the people; moreover, Council hereby declares the necessity to identify areas,
places, buildings, structures, sites, objects, and works of art based upon
historic, architectural, archaeological, or cultural significance related to
the historical development of the City for establishment as a preservation
district; finally, Council hereby declares the necessity to have a Preservation
Commission and shall establish the same along with procedures for the
enforcement of historic design review guidelines whereby historic,
architectural, archaeological, and cultural resources within a duly designated
preservation district are afforded protection from actions that would be
detrimental to their preservation, enhancement, and continued use, as well as
to prevent inappropriate or incompatible construction within the preservation
district. Purely residential structures are expressly exempt from regulation
under this chapter.
(Ord. 032-09. Passed 5-21-09.)
1138.03 PURPOSES.
   The purposes of this chapter are:
   (a)   To establish procedures whereby certain specified areas of the City
are afforded protection from actions that would be detrimental to preserving
established historic and cultural resources in the community, and to pursue the
following objectives:
      (1)   Maintain and enhance the distinctive character of historic
buildings and historic areas;
      (2)   Safeguard the architectural integrity of historic properties and
resources within designated districts;
      (3)   Seek alternatives to demolition or incompatible alterations within
designated areas before such acts are performed; and,
      (4)   Encourage development of vacant properties in accordance with the
character of the designated districts.
   (b)   To contribute to the economic, cultural and educational development of
the City by:
      (1)   Protecting and enhancing the City's attractions to prospective
residents, businesses, and visitors;
      (2)   Providing support and stimulus to business and industry;
      (3)   Strengthening the economy of the City by stabilizing and improving
property values; and,
      (4)   Facilitating reinvestment in and revitalization of certain older
districts and neighborhoods.
         (Ord. 032-09. Passed 5-21-09.)
1138.04 ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICT IN ZONE MAP.
   The preservation district shall be established on the official zoning map as
an overlay district encompassing all commercial buildings in the downtown of
the City. As an overlay district, the requirements of both the preservation
district and the underlying zoning district shall apply. (Ord. 032-09. Passed
5-21-09.)
1138.05 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS REQUIRED.
   (a)   Within the boundaries of any preservation district established, a
certificate of appropriateness shall be required from the Preservation
Commission, regardless of any other rule, regulation or law governing the same
or similar matter before any owner of property used for commercial purposes may
receive a zoning permit or commence work for any proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration, replacement, repair, modification, or demolition of
a structure, exterior wall, or exterior architectural feature of any building
or structure, including installation or visible changes to fences, signs, or
other visible exterior improvements.
   (b)   Exclusions.
      (1)   Normal maintenance and repair. Now or hereafter in the preservation
district, nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any normal
maintenance or repair of a structure or architectural feature which does not
involve a change in material, architectural design, arrangement, or texture. At
this time, no review of color is required.
      (2)   Demolition after substantial damage. Any structure that has been
burned or damaged by an event not within the landowner's control and where more
than fifty (50%) percent of the structure is substantially "affected," may be
demolished, regardless of the building's significance.
      (3)   Emergency orders.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as to
prevent the alteration, change, construction, reconstruction, or demolition of
any structure or architectural feature which any governmental authority
designates as being unsafe or presents a dangerous condition as may be required
for the public safety pursuant to any applicable City code.
         (Ord. 032-09. Passed 5-21-09.)
1138.06 HISTORIC DISTRICT GUIDELINES.
   This section provides design review standards for buildings and structures
within the preservation district which have been designated as a historic
resource by Council or where such designation has been recommended by the
Preservation Commission and is pending Council approval, as well as standards
for new or existing buildings and structures which do not qualify as a historic
resource. These standards are designed to promote redevelopment of historic
structures and compatible new development within the preservation district.
   (a)   Standards for Historic Resources. In reviewing proposed alterations or
changes to property, the Preservation Commission shall use as evaluative
criteria the most recent update of the "United States Secretary of the
Interior's Standards and Illustrated Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic
Buildings" by Morton, Hume, Weeks, and Jandl (U.S. National Park Service,
Preservation Assistance Division, 1991, as reprinted in 1997). These standards
and guidelines are referenced and made a part of this planning and zoning code.
The ten (10) standards are restated herein:
      (1)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
      (2)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
      (3)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historic development, such
as architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
      (4)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
      (5)   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of skilled craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall
be preserved.
      (6)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing architectural features shall be substantiated by documentary,
physical, or pictorial evidence.
      (7)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
      (8)   Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
      (9)   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
      (10)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   (b)   Standards for Properties Not Designated as Historic Resources. For
property, except purely residential structures, which is not a designated or
recommended historic resource, the Preservation Commission shall determine
appropriateness by whether the proposed activity will have a negative effect on
the historic character and visual integrity of the preservation district.
Building architecture, materials, and height should be designed to complement
and coordinate with historic resources in the preservation district. If new
materials are to be used for buildings that are architecturally
undistinguished, they should be selected to coordinate with neighboring
structures and to complement the design of the structure. Color selection shall
not be subject to review.
   (c)   New Construction Design Standards. Any proposed new construction in
the preservation district shall not be limited to any one historical period or
architectural style, but shall seek to be evocative of the general
architectural styles, historic character, and preserve the architectural
integrity of existing historic resources in the district. For example, new
buildings should maintain the repetitive storefront widths along established
block facades to create a unified street wall. On traditional storefront
buildings, recessed entrances are encouraged.
   (d)   Vacant Structure Maintenance Required. The owner of an historic
structure or any structure within preservation district, if such structure is
vacant and uninhabited, shall provide sufficient maintenance and upkeep for
such structure to ensure its perpetuation and to prevent its destruction by
deterioration.
   (e)   Demolition Applications. Subject to Section
1138.05(b), and subject to an administrative review before the Preservation
Commission, demolition of a structure in the preservation district shall only
be approved when the structure contains no features of architectural or
historic significance, where the structure does not contribute to maintaining
the character of the preservation district, and where the applicant allows for
reasonable salvage of significant architectural features prior to the issuance
of the demolition permit. Factors for consideration may include: the building's
historic, architectural, and urban design significance; whether the building is
one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood, the City,
or the region; whether the structure has historic events or persons associated
with it; and the building's condition. If the building is not properly secured
and is lost during this period due to fire or other causes, then the action is
treated as an unlawful demolition.
(Ord. 032-09. Passed 5-21-09.)
1138.07 ZONING ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Zoning Administrator of the City shall receive all applications for
Certificates of Appropriateness. The Zoning Administrator shall ensure that any
application for a Zoning Permit, where a Certificate of Appropriateness is also
required, shall first receive a Certificate of Appropriateness from the
Preservation Commission prior to Zoning Permit application review. The Zoning
Administrator shall enforce all approvals issued by vote of the Preservation
Commission by including any conditions in a Certificate of Appropriateness as
part of the conditions of a subsequent Zoning Permit.
(Ord. 032-09. Passed 5-21-09.)
1138.08 APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   Application Requirements. Blank applications for a Certificate of
Appropriateness shall be available at the City's principal office or other

detail, and clarity for reasonable use by the Preservation Commission;
         B.   Sketches of proposed new construction facades, or changes to each
exterior wall, or proposed installation or visible changes to signs, fences,
and/or other visible exterior improvements. Sketches shall be drawn as near as
possible to scale and be easily understandable. Sketches shall depict and fully
describe using notations all proposed changes and additions, including:
            1.   Structural changes which impact the exterior of the building;
            2.   All windows and doorways;
            3.   Roof lines;
            4.   Signage;
         C.   A description of the proposed materials to be used;
         D.   A request for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be
accompanied by any applicable fees as may be directed by ordinance of Council.
   (b)   Determination of Completeness. Upon receipt of a request for a
Certificate of Appropriateness, the Zoning Administrator shall make a
determination the application is complete. The applicant shall be informed of
any omissions to the application. The determination that an application is
"complete" shall be noted on the face of the application by the Zoning
Administrator. Complete applications shall be forwarded to the Clerk of the
Preservation Commission.
(Ord. 032-09. Passed 5-21-09.)
1138.09 ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Hearing Date for Certificate of Appropriateness. An application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness shall require review by the Preservation
Commission at an administrative hearing.
      (1)   General applications. Upon receipt of a "complete" application for
a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Zoning Administrator, the Clerk for
the Preservation Commission shall contact the Chairman to set the date and time
for an administrative hearing to review the application. The administrative
hearing shall be designated neither less than ten (10) days nor more than
forty-five (45) days from the date of application. The Clerk shall forward
complete applications to the members of the Preservation Commission as soon as
possible.
      (2)   Hearing date for demolition applications.
         A.   Where a structure has not been reviewed for designation as a
Historic Resource, but the building or structure at issue is found to be both
"significant" and "preferably preserved," review for demolition may be delayed
up to ninety (90) days to allow for a determination of historical or
architectural merit.
         B.   Where a structure has been recommended as a Historic Resource by
the Preservation Commission and is pending Council approval, the hearing date
shall be delayed and the status quo preserved pending designation to prevent
anticipatory demolitions.
         C.   Where a structure is designated as a Historic Resource by
Council, a hearing on the demolition application may be delayed up to twenty-
four (24) months to allow the Preservation Commission, preservation
organizations, concerned citizens, and others to explore alternatives to
demolition, such as finding a purchaser for the structure or raising money for
its rehabilitation.
   (b)   Public Notice of Hearing. The public shall be given notice of: the
date, time, and place of the administrative hearing; a short description of the
purpose, location of the subject property, and the review body involved; and
informed that a copy of the application, together with all maps, plans, and
reports submitted with reference thereto, shall be on file for public
examination in the office of the Zoning Administrator. Notice shall be provided
as follows:
      (1)   First class mail. The Zoning Administrator shall cause to be
provided written notice by first class mail or hand delivery to the applicant
and all property owners within two hundred (200) feet of the subject property
at least ten (10) days in advance of the date the Preservation Commission is to
convene to review the request. Such notice shall also be sent by first-class
mail to any person who within the past twelve (12) months has submitted a
written request to the Zoning Administrator to be notified of any application
for a Certificate of Appropriateness.
      (2)   Sign. Notice shall also be posted by a sign placed by the Zoning
Administrator on the subject property and visible from the public right-of-way
for at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing.
   (c)   Administrative Hearing Proceedings. All administrative hearings of the
Preservation Commission shall be open to the public.
      (1)   Upon convening a public hearing, the Chairman shall:
         A.   State the application pending, indicate the dates and methods
public notice was provided, and state the standard set forth in this chapter
for the granting of the application.
         B.   The Chairman shall recognize any City staff report and
recommendation prepared on the application.
         C.   Administer the oath to each person presenting testimony to the
Preservation Commission at the hearing. The oath may be given on an individual
basis or to all persons present; however, where the oath is given as a group,
the Chairman shall verify that each person who presents testimony was present
and gave an affirmative response.
         D.   The applicant and any other proponent parties in interest shall
be invited to give testimony prior to opponent parties in interest. Any party
in interest may be represented by an attorney or expert witness. All testimony
shall be subject to cross-examination.
         E.   Prior to dismissing a witness, the Chairman shall recognize
members of the Preservation Commission with questions or comments regarding the
testimony. Members of the Preservation Commission should examine and compare
the application and testimony against the applicable Historic Design Review
Guidelines established for the Preservation District, and probe to separate
fact from opinion and lay opinion from expert opinion. All questions and
responses shall be directed through the Chairman.
         F.   Where additional time or information not available at the hearing
is required, the Chairman may continue a hearing to a date, time, and place
announced at the time the hearing is continued. Such a continuance shall not
require additional public notice.
         G.   Upon the presentation of all relevant testimony, the Chairman
shall close the administrative hearing and the Preservation Commission shall
deliberate upon the application and reach a decision.
      (2)   The Preservation Commission shall first determine if the structure
is identified by the City as a Historic Resource or has the potential for
designation as a Historic Resource. If the property has the potential for
designation as a Historic Resource, the Preservation Commission shall recommend
it to Council and proceed with review of the application according to the
Historic Design Review Guidelines as if the property has been identified as a
Historic Resource. If the application does not involve a Historic Resource, the
Preservation Commission shall proceed with review according to the Historic
Design Review Guidelines for properties not designated as Historic Resources.
   (d)   Decision by the Preservation Commission.  Regardless of any
continuances of the hearing, the Preservation Commission shall make every
reasonable effort to render a decision on the application within forty-five
(45) days after the application was received, unless an extension of time is
agreed to by the applicant.
      (1)   The Preservation Commission shall consider the application(s),
plans and specifications, and determine whether the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alterations, or demolition is appropriate, or whether it has an
adverse effect upon the purposes of the Preservation District. The Preservation
Commission shall issue its decision in the form of a written Final Order in
which it expressly sets forth the findings and conclusions of fact used as the
basis or rationale for the decision.
      (2)   Approval. If the applicant has proven by the preponderance of the
evidence on the whole record that the proposed activity will have no adverse
effect on a Historic Resource or the historic character or architectural
integrity of all or a portion the Preservation District, then the Preservation
Commission shall vote to grant the application and cause the Chairman to
endorse a Certificate of Appropriateness and return the plans and
specifications to the applicant, retaining a copy thereof to the extent that is
used for deliberation in the hearing. All evidence and record of the
proceedings may be maintained by the office of the Zoning Adminstrator, subject
to disposal in accordance with a record retention schedule.
         A.   Approval Subject to Modifications. The Certificate of
Appropriateness may include any reasonable conditions placed upon the approval
regarding the proposed activity. Such conditions shall be made part of the
Certificate of Appropriateness and of any subsequent zoning approval. Receiving
a Certificate of Appropriateness does not negate requirements to adhere to all
other City zoning regulations and City, County and/or State building
regulations.
         B.   Demolition. A Certificate of Appropriateness may be issued for
demolition upon a finding that:
            1.   The structure itself, or in relation to its environs, has no
significant historical, architectural, aesthetic or cultural value in its
present restored condition; or,
            2.   Realistic alternatives (including adaptive uses) are not
economically viable because of the nature or cost of work necessary to preserve
such structure or realize any appreciable part of such value. Such finding
shall require the applicant to submit sufficient evidence to meet the burden of
proof that "bona fide," reasonable, and unsuccessful efforts to locate a
purchaser for the building or structure who is willing to preserve,
rehabilitate or restore the building or structure; or,
            3.   The demolition is consistent with, or materially furthers, the
criteria and purpose of this chapter; or,
            4.   The applicant has agreed to accept a Demolition Permit on
specified conditions approved by the Preservation Commission.
         C.   Additional Demolition Instruction. When a Certificate of
Appropriateness is issued for demolition, the applicant shall receive further
instruction that new in-fill construction in the Preservation District is
subject to review by the Preservation Commission.
         D.   Termination. The Certificate of Appropriateness will be valid for
one (1) year from the date of approval.
      (3)   Denial. If however, the Preservation Commission determines that the
proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration, or demolition will have an
adverse effect on the District and violates the spirit and purposes of these
regulations, then the Preservation Commission shall deny issuance of the
Certificate of Appropriateness. If the Certificate of Appropriateness is
denied, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the following:
         A.   The reasons for denial, and recommendations for a subsequent
resubmission of a modified application, if any.
         B.   The Preservation Commission shall offer to undertake continuing
and meaningful discussions with the applicant over a period of at least thirty
(30) days, but not to exceed six (6) months, from the date of denial, during
which time the Preservation Commission shall search for an acceptable
compromise proposal that would allow for approval.
         C.   Denial of Application for Demolition. In the case of a denial of
an application for demolition, in addition to the offer to undertake continuing
and meaningful discussions in paragraph "B" above, the Preservation Commission
shall offer to investigate financial and other opportunities for the
preservation of the subject property, including purchase by a third party. The
Preservation Commission shall offer to continue to schedule good faith
discussions at least every forty-five (45) days after the initial
administrative hearing.
            1.   If a compromise proposal is accepted by both parties, or if
the Preservation Commission later determines that preservation of a structure
proposed for demolition is not feasible, the Preservation Commission may
henceforth reverse its Final Order and issue a Certificate of Appropriateness.
            2.   If the applicant fails to meet with the Preservation
Commission in good faith at the time specified, then discussions may terminate.
Upon termination for any reason, the Preservation Commission shall inform the
applicant in writing of the termination of such good faith discussions and that
the Final Order for denial of the application shall stand.
            3.   If, after holding such good faith discussion over the
continued discussion period, no alternative property use is developed or no
offer to preserve the structure or architecturally significant features is made
by the applicant, a third party, or the City, then the Preservation Commission
may also consider whether failure to issue a Certificate of Appropriateness
will create a situation where, because of the character of the property, it
cannot be used and the result would be a taking, violating the owner's
Constitutional rights. If such a finding is made, the Preservation Commission
shall further determine whether a Certificate of Appropriateness may be issued
without substantial detriment to the public welfare and without substantial
derogation from the purposes of this Ordinance. In such event, the Preservation
Commission may reverse its Final Order and grant the application, with or
without modifications.
               (Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1138.10 APPEAL OF PRESERVATION COMMISSION FINAL ORDER.
   An applicant who has received an approval subject to modifications or has
been denied a Certificate of Appropriateness by the Preservation Commission may
appeal the decision to Council, Council acting as an Administration Hearing
Board.
   (a)   Any such appeal shall be made within thirty (30) days of the date of
the Final Order or the date of termination of good faith discussions by the
Preservation Commission.
   (b)   Grounds for the appeal shall be given by the applicant in the papers
submitted and the grounds shall be limited to procedural errors by the
Preservation Commission, failure by the Preservation Commission to consider the
entire record presented to the Preservation Commission with respect to the
application, an incomplete explanation for the decision reached by the
Preservation Commission, or where there has been a clear misapplication of the
Historic Design Review Guidelines.
   (c)   When considering an appeal, the Council shall review the entire record
before the Preservation Commission.
   (d)   The Council may request additional information from the Preservation
Commission and/or from the applicant.
   (e)   The Council may by two thirds vote of its current members and by
motion, affirm, reverse, or modify the Preservation Commission's decision. If
the Council affirms the decision, the denial of the Certificate will stand. If
the Council reverses or modifies the decision of the Preservation Commission,
it shall state the reasons for the reversal or modification.

1139.01 DEFINITIONS. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR’S NOTE: Former Section
1139.01 was repealed by Ordinance 074-2010.)
1139.02 NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES REQUIRED.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) all developments in all zoning
districts shall provide a sufficient number of parking spaces, (according to
the parking tables in this chapter) to accommodate the number of vehicles that
ordinarily are likely to be attracted to the development in question.
   (b)   In the C-1 Zoning District, the number of parking space requirements
for use of basement, second, third and higher floor areas, shall be reduced by
50% from those figures stated in the parking tables in this Planning and Zoning
Code.
   (c)   Uses in the Table of Parking Requirements (subsection (e) of this
section), as indicated by a numerical reference and description keyed to the
Table of Permissible Uses, Section
1145.01 et seq. When determination of the number of parking spaces required by
this table results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of one-
half or less may be disregarded, while a fraction in excess of one-half shall
be counted as one parking space.
   (d)   In cases of parking requirements not specifically covered, the Zoning
Administrator is authorized to determine the parking requirements using this
table as a guide.
   (e)   Table of Parking Requirements (see Table of Parking Requirements in
this Planning and Zoning Code). (Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1139.03 FLEXIBILITY IN ADMINISTRATION REQUIRED.
   (a)   The Zoning Administrator may allow deviations from the parking
requirements set forth in the Table of Parking Requirements when the Zoning
Administrator finds that:
      (1)   A residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the
elderly; or
      (2)   A business is primarily oriented to walk-in trade; or
      (3)   The business does not require the number of spaces established in
this Planning and Zoning Code due to the nature of the business.
   (b)   Whenever the Zoning Administrator allows or requires a deviation from
the presumptive parking requirements set forth in the Table of Parking
Requirements, the Zoning Administrator shall enter on the face of the permit
the parking requirement that the Zoning Administrator imposes and the reasons
for allowing or requiring the deviation.
   (c)   If the Zoning Administrator concludes, based upon information it
receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal, that the
presumption established by the Table of Parking Requirements for a particular
use classification is erroneous, the Zoning Administrator shall initiate a
request for an amendment to the Table of Parking Requirements in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Chapter
1121.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1139.04 PARKING SPACE DIMENSIONS.
   (a)   Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, each parking space
shall contain a rectangular area at least nineteen (19) feet long and nine (9)
feet wide. Lines demarcating parking spaces may be drawn at various angles in
relation to curbs and aisles, so long as the parking spaces so created contain
within them the rectangular area required by this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (b)   In parking areas containing ten (10) or more parking spaces, up to
twenty (20%) percent of the parking spaces need contain a rectangular area of
only fifteen (15) feet in length and seven and one-half (7½) feet in width. If
such spaces are provided, they shall be conspicuously designated as reserved
for only small or compact cars.
   (c)   Wherever parking areas consist of spaces set aside for parallel
parking, the dimensions of such parking spaces shall not be less than twenty-
two (22) feet in length by nine (9) feet in width.
   (d)   Parking for the Disabled shall be in compliance with the requirements
set forth in the Americans with Disabilities Act.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1139.05 REQUIRED WIDTHS OF PARKING AISLES AND DRIVEWAYS.
   (a)   Parking area aisle widths shall conform to the following table, which
varies the width requirement according to the angle of parking (see Table A).
 
Table A. Aisle Width Parking Requirements.
Aisle Width     Parking Angle (in degrees)
                0  30 45 60 90
One-way Traffic 13 11 13 18 24
Two-way Traffic 19 20 21 23 24
 
   (b)   Driveways shall be not less than ten (10) feet in width for one-way
traffic and eighteen (18) feet in width for two-way traffic, except that ten
(10) feet-wide driveways are permissible for two-way traffic when (i) the
driveway is not longer than fifty (50) feet, (ii) it provides access to not
more than six (6) spaces, and (iii) sufficient turning space is provided so
that vehicles need not back into a public street.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
 
1139.06 GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Unless no other practicable alternative is available, vehicle
accommodation areas shall be designed so that, without resorting to
extraordinary movements, vehicles may exit such areas without backing onto a
public street. This requirement does not apply to parking areas consisting of
driveways that serve one or two dwelling units, although backing onto arterial
streets is discouraged.
 
   (b)   Vehicle accommodation areas of all developments shall be designed so
that sanitation, emergency, and other public service vehicles can serve such
developments without the necessity of backing unreasonable distances or making
other dangerous or hazardous turning movements.
 
   (c)   Every vehicle accommodation area shall be designed so that vehicles
cannot extend beyond the perimeter of such area onto adjacent properties or
public right-of-way. Such areas shall also be designed so that vehicles do not
extend over sidewalks or tend to bump against or damage any wall, vegetation,
or other obstruction.
 
   (d)   Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed
safely without posing a danger to pedestrians or other vehicles and without
interfering with parking areas.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
 
1139.07 VEHICLE ACCOMMODATION AREA SURFACES.
   (a)   Vehicle accommodation areas that:
      (1)   Include lanes for drive-in windows, or,
      (2)   Contain parking areas that are required to have more than ten (10)
parking spaces and that are used regularly at least five (5) days per week will
be graded and surfaced with asphalt, concrete and other material that will
provide equivalent protection against potholes, erosion, and dust.
Specifications for surfaces shall meet the standard as set forth in the City’s
Engineering Department Rules and Regulations.
   (b)   Vehicle accommodation areas that are not provided with the type of
surface specified in subsection (a) of this section shall be graded and
surfaced with crushed stone, gravel, or other suitable material to provide a
surface that is stable and will help reduce dust and erosion. The perimeter of
such parking areas shall be defined by bricks, stones, railroad ties, or other
similar devices. In addition, whenever such a vehicle accommodation area abuts
a paved street, the driveway leading from such street to such area (or, if
there is no driveway, the portion of the vehicle accommodation area that opens
onto such streets), shall be paved as provided in the City’s Engineering
Department Rules and Regulations, for a distance of fifteen (15) feet back from
the edge of the paved street or up to the property line which ever is the
greater distance from the edge of the abutting street. This Subsection shall
not apply to single-family or two-family dwellings or other uses that are
required to have only one or two parking spaces.
   (c)   Parking spaces in areas surfaced in accordance with subsection (a) of
this section shall be appropriately demarcated with painted lines or other
markings. Parking spaces in areas surfaced in accordance with subsection (b) of
this section shall be demarcated whenever practicable.
   (d)   Vehicle accommodation areas shall be properly maintained in all
respects. In particular, and without limiting the foregoing, vehicle
accommodation area surfaces shall be kept in good condition (free from
potholes, etc.) and parking space lines or markings shall be kept clearly
visible and distinct.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
 
1139.08 JOINT USE OF REQUIRED PARKING SPACES.
   (a)   One parking area may contain required spaces for several different
uses, but except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the required space
assigned to one use may not be credited to any other use.
   (b)   To the extent that developments that wish to make joint use of the
same parking spaces operate at different times, the same spaces may be credited
to both uses. For example, if a parking lot is used in connection with an
office building on Monday through Friday but is generally ninety (90%) percent
vacant on weekends, another development that operates only on weekends could be
credited with ninety (90) percent of the spaces on that lot.
   (c)   If the joint use of the same parking spaces for two or more principal
uses involves satellite parking spaces, then the provisions of the Satellite
Parking Section
1139.09 are also applicable.
 
1139.09 SATELLITE PARKING.
   (a)   If the number of off-street parking spaces required by this chapter
cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot where the principal use
associated with these parking spaces is located, then spaces may be provided on
adjacent or nearby lots in accordance with the provisions of this Section.
These off-site spaces are referred to in this Section as satellite parking
spaces.
   (b)   All such satellite parking spaces (except spaces intended for employee
use) must be located within eight hundred (800) feet of the lot on which the
use associated with such parking is located if the use is not housed within any
principal building. Satellite parking spaces intended for employee use may be
located within any reasonable distance.
   (c)   The developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this
Section must present satisfactory written evidence that the developer has the
permission of the owner or other person in charge of the satellite parking
spaces to use such spaces. The developer must also sign an acknowledgment that
the continuing validity of his or her permit depends upon his or her continuing
ability to provide the requisite number of parking spaces.
(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
 
1139.10 SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR LOTS WITH EXISTING BUILDINGS.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Planning and Zoning Code,
whenever:
   (a)   There exists a lot with one or more structures on it constructed
before the effective date of this Planning and Zoning Code, and
   (b)   A change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure
is proposed for such lot; and
   (c)   The parking requirements of the Parking Section that would be
applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot
because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably
be used for parking and there is sufficient area available on the lot that can
be used for parking, then the developer need only comply with the requirements
of the Parking Section to the extent that:
      (1)   Parking space is practicably available on the lot where the
development is located; and
      (2)   Satellite parking space is reasonably available as provided in the
Joint Use of Required Parking Spaces Section (
1139.08). However, if satellite parking subsequently becomes reasonably
available, then it shall be a continuing condition of the permit authorizing
development on such lot that the developer obtains satellite parking when it
does become available.
         (Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
 
1139.11 LOADING AND UNLOADING AREAS.
   (a)   Subject to subsection (e) of this section, whenever the normal
operation of any development requires that goods, merchandise, or equipment be
routinely delivered to or shipped from that development, a sufficient off-
street loading and unloading area must be provided in accordance with this
section to accommodate the delivery or shipment operations in a safe and
convenient manner.
   (b)   The loading and unloading area must be of sufficient size to
accommodate the numbers and types of vehicles that are likely to use this area,
given the nature of the development in question. The following table indicates
the number and size of spaces that, presumptively, satisfy the standard set
forth in this Subsection. However, the Zoning Administrator may require more or
less loading and unloading area if reasonably necessary to satisfy the
foregoing standard (see Table B).
Table B: Loading and Unloading Requirements
Gross Leasable Area of Building Number of Spaces
                                (see NOTE)
1,000 - 19,999                  1
20,000 - 79,999                 2
80,000 - 127,999                3
128,000 - 191,999               4
192,000 - 255,999               5
256,000 - 319,999               6
320,000 - 391,999               7
Plus one (1) space for each additional 72,000 square feet or fraction thereof.
NOTE: Minimum dimensions of twelve (12) feet by fifty-five (55) feet and
overhead clearance of fourteen (14) feet from street grade required.
 
   (c)   Loading and unloading areas shall be so located and designed that the
vehicles intended to use them can (i) maneuver safely and conveniently to and
from a public right-of-way, and (ii) complete the loading and unloading
operations without obstructing or interfering with any public right-of-way or
any parking space or parking lot aisle.
   (d)   No area allocated to loading and unloading facilities may be used to
satisfy the area requirements for off-street parking, nor shall any portion of
any off-street parking area be used to satisfy the area requirements for
loading and unloading facilities.
   (e)   Whenever (i) there exists a lot with one or more structures on it
constructed before the effective date of this Planning and Zoning Code, and
(ii) a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is
proposed for such lot, and (iii) the loading requirements of this section
cannot be satisfied because there is not sufficient area available on the lot
that can practicably be used for loading and unloading, then the developer need
only comply with this chapter to the extent reasonably possible.

CHAPTER 1141
Zoning Permits; Special and Conditional Uses
1141.01   Zoning permits.
1141.02   Conditional use permit procedures.
1141.03   Conditional use when required; regulations.
1141.04   Authorizing use.
 
1141.01 ZONING PERMITS.
   (a)   Permits Required.
      (1)   The use made of property may not be substantially changed without a
zoning permit. Substantial clearing, grading, or excavation may not be
commenced, and buildings or other substantial structures may not be
constructed, erected, moved, or substantially altered except in accordance with
and pursuant to a zoning permit and when applicable, a conditional use permit
or variance authorized by the applicable board, commission or Council as
provided in this Planning and Zoning Code.
      (2)   Zoning permits, and conditional use permits shall issue under this
Planning and Zoning Code only when a review of the application submitted,
including the plans contained therein, indicates that the development and use
of the land or structures will comply with the provisions of this Planning and
Zoning Code if completed as proposed. Such plans and applications as are
finally approved are incorporated into any permit issued, and except as
otherwise provided in Section
1141.04(c), all development shall occur strictly in accordance with such
approved plans and application.
      (3)   Physical improvements to land to be subdivided may not be commenced
until the preliminary plat has been approved by the Council and a zoning permit
has been issued.
      (4)   A zoning permit or conditional use permit shall be issued in the
name of the applicant ( except that applications submitted by an agent shall be
issued in the name of the principal), shall identify the property involved and
the proposed use, shall incorporate by reference the plans submitted, and shall
contain any special conditions or requirements lawfully imposed by the permit
issuing authority.
   (b)   No Occupancy, Use or Sale of Lots Until Requirements Fulfilled.
Issuance of a zoning permit and when applicable, a conditional use permit,
authorizes the recipient to commence the activity resulting in a change in use
of land or to commence work designed to construct, erect, move, or
substantially alter buildings or other substantial structures or to make
necessary improvements to a subdivision. However, except as provided in Section
1141.04(a) the intended use may not be commenced, no building may be occupied,
and in the case of subdivisions, no lots may be sold until compliance is
achieved by meeting all requirements of this Planning and Zoning Code and all
additional requirements imposed pursuant to the issuance of a zoning permit,
and where applicable, a conditional use permit.
   (c)   Who May Submit Permit Applications.
      (1)   Applications for zoning permits, conditional use permits, and
variances, or subdivision plat approval will be accepted only from persons
having the legal authority to take action in accordance with the permit or the
subdivision plat approval. By way of illustration, in general this means that
applications should be made by owners of property, or their authorized
representatives evidenced by a duly executed power of attorney.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall require an applicant to submit
evidence of the applicant’s authority to submit the application in accordance
with subsection (a) of this section whenever there appears to be a reasonable
basis for questioning this authority.
   (d)   All Applications to Be Complete.
      (1)   All applications for zoning, conditional use or variance, must be
complete before the permit issuing authority is required to consider the
application.
      (2)   Subject to subsection (d)(3) of this section, an application is
complete when it contains all the information that is necessary for the permit
issuing authority to decide whether or not the development, if completed as
proposed, will comply with all of the requirements of this Planning and Zoning
Code.
      (3)   In this Planning and Zoning Code, detailed or technical design
requirements and construction specifications relating to various types of
improvements (streets, sidewalks, etc.) are set forth in the Engineering
Department rules and regulations. It is not necessary that the applicant
contain the type of detailed construction drawings that would be necessary to
determine compliance with such rules and regulations, so long as the plans
provide sufficient information to allow the permit issuing authority to
evaluate the application in light of the substantive requirements set forth in
the text of this Planning and Zoning Code.
      (4)   However, whenever this Planning and Zoning Code requires a certain
element of a development to be constructed in accordance with the detailed
requirements set forth in the Engineering Department rules and regulations,
then no construction work on such element may be commenced until detailed
construction drawings have been submitted to and approved by the Zoning
Administrator. Failure to observe this requirement may result in permit
revocation, denial of final subdivision plat approval, or other penalty as
provided.
      (5)   The presumption established by this Planning and Zoning Code is
that all of the information set forth in the Engineering Department rules and
regulations is necessary to satisfy the requirements of this Section. However,
it is recognized that each development is unique, and therefore the permit
issuing authority may allow less information or require more information to be
submitted according to the needs of the particular case. For applications
submitted to the Council or Planning Commission, the applicant may rely in the
first instance on the recommendations of the Zoning Administrator as to whether
more or less information should be submitted.
      (6)   The Zoning Administrator shall make every effort to develop
application forms, instructional sheets, checklists, or other techniques or
devices to assist applicants in understanding the application requirements and
the form and type of information that must be submitted. The Zoning
Administrator shall develop standard forms that will expedite the submission of
the necessary plans and other required information.
   (e)   Pre-Application Consulting.
      (1)   To minimize development planning costs, avoid misunderstanding or
misinterpretation, and to ensure compliance with the requirements of this
Planning and Zoning Code, pre-application consultation between the developer
and the Zoning Administrator is encouraged or required as provided in this
Planning and Zoning Code.
      (2)   Before submitting an application for a development, the developer
shall submit to the Zoning Administrator a sketch plan of such development,
drawn approximately to scale (1 inch = 100 feet). The sketch plan shall contain
all the following:
         A.   The name and address of the developer,
         B.   The proposed name (if a subdivision) and location,
         C.   The approximate total acreage of the proposed development,
         D.   The tentative street and lot arrangement,
         E.   Topographic lines, and
         F.   Any other information the developer believes necessary to obtain
the informal opinion of the planning staff as to the proposed development's
compliance with the requirements of this Planning and Zoning Code.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall meet with the developer as soon as
conveniently possible to review the sketch plan.
      (4)   Before submitting an application for any other permit, developers
are strongly encouraged to consult with the Zoning Administrator concerning the
application of this Planning and Zoning Code to the proposed development.
   (f)   Staff Consultation After Application Submitted.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a formal application for a zoning permit,
conditional use permit, variance or subdivision plat approval, the Zoning
Administrator shall review the application and confer with the applicant to
ensure that the applicant understands the planning staff’s interpretation of
the applicable requirements of this Planning and Zoning Code, that applicant
has submitted all of the information that the applicant intends to submit, and
that the application represents precisely and completely what applicant
proposes to do.
      (2)   If the application is for a conditional use permit, variance or
subdivision approval, the Zoning Administrator shall place the application on
the agenda of the appropriate board or commission when the Zoning Administrator
determines the application is complete.
   (g)   Zoning Permits.
      (1)   A completed application form for a zoning permit shall be submitted
to the Zoning Administrator by filing a copy of the application with the said
Administrator in the Building/Zoning Department.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall issue any zoning permit when the
Zoning Administrator finds, after reviewing the application and consulting with
the applicant as provided in Section
1141.01(e) that the permit is being issued in compliance with this Planning and
Zoning Code.
         (Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1141.02 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to maintain uniformity in
zoning districts but provide for certain uses in an area which is economically
feasible and still compatible with neighboring properties within the
corporation limits, thus there are established conditional use permits.
   (b)   Existing Conditional, Special or Contingent Uses. Where a use is
classified as a conditional use under this Planning and Zoning Code, and
existed as a permitted, conditional, special or contingent use on or before the
effective date of this Planning and Zoning Code, it shall be considered a
lawful conditional use subject to the following:
      (1)   A conditional use, special use or contingent use authorized prior
to the adoption of this Planning and Zoning Code may continue to exist under
its current terms and status, subject to the provisions of this Planning and
Zoning Code.
      (2)   Existing conditional, special or contingent uses may be expanded or
extended only after applying for and obtaining an amended conditional use
permit.
   (c)   Application for a Conditional Use Permit. An application for a
conditional use permit shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator on a form
utilized by the Planning Commission. Such application shall be filed by those
persons identified in Section
1141.01(c)(1). The application shall be accompanied by plans and written data
that will provide adequate evidence that the proposed use will conform to the
standards of the appropriate sections of this Planning and Zoning Code.

   (e)   Findings of Fact and Recommendations of the Planning Commission. The
Planning Commission Chairman shall cause to be made written findings of fact
and shall submit the same together with the Planning Commission's
recommendations to the Council after the close of the hearing regarding
issuance of a conditional use. Any member of the Planning Commission dissenting
from the majority opinion may make his or her own dissention known in writing,
to be furnished to Council as part of the record. No conditional use shall be
recommended by the Planning Commission unless the Planning Commission finds
that the criteria found in subsection (e), paragraphs 1 through 8, as deemed
applicable by the Planning Commission, are satisfied.
      (1)   The proposed use is in fact a use subject to the issuance of a
conditional use permit as established under the provisions of this Planning and
Zoning Code, and that the use is not otherwise expressly prohibited by this

character of the general vicinity and that the use will not change the
essential character of the same area;
      (4)   The use will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future
neighboring uses;
      (5)   The use will be served adequately by essential public facilities
and services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer, and schools; or that the persons
or agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed use will be able
to provide adequately any such services;
      (6)   The use will not create excessive additional requirements at public
cost for public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the
economic welfare of the community;
      (7)   The use will not involve uses, activities, process, materials,
equipment and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons,
property or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic,
noise, smoke, fumes or odors; and,
      (8)   The use will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall
be so designated as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding
public thoroughfares.
   
   (f)   Conditions. The Planning Commission may recommend such conditions or
restrictions on the construction, location, use, and operation of a conditional
use as shall be deemed necessary to adequately address the general objectives
of the Master Plan and this Planning and Zoning Code after considering those
things, as applicable, as listed in subsection (e).
   (g)   Action by the Council. The Council shall not act on a proposed
conditional use permit until it has received a written report and findings of
fact and recommendation from the Planning Commission on the conditional use
permit.
   (h)   Effect of Denial of a Conditional Use Permit. No application for a
conditional use permit which has been denied by the Council shall be
resubmitted to the Planning Commission for a period of one year from the date
of such denial, except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of changing
conditions which the Zoning Administrator finds valid. No permit shall be
issued without following the procedure established in this Planning and Zoning
Code.

(Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1141.04 AUTHORIZING USE.
   (a)   Authorizing Use, Occupancy, or Sale Before Completion of Development
Under Conditional Use Permits.
      (1)   In cases when, because of weather conditions or other factors
beyond the control of the conditional use permit recipient (exclusive of
financial hardship) it would be unreasonable to require the permit recipient to
comply with all the requirements of this Planning and Zoning Code before
commencing the intended use of the property or selling lots in a subdivision,
the Planning Commission may authorize the commencement of the intended use or
the sale of subdivision lots (insofar as the requirements of this Planning and
Zoning Code are concerned) if the permit recipient provides a performance bond
or other security satisfactory to the Planning Commission to ensure that all of
these requirements will be fulfilled within a reasonable period (not to exceed
12 months).
      (2)   When the Planning Commission imposes additional requirements upon
the permit recipient in accordance with Section
1141.02 or when the developer proposes in the plans submitted to install
amenities beyond those required by this Planning and Zoning Code, the Planning
Commission may authorize the permittee to commence the intended use of the
property or to sell any subdivision lots before the additional requirements are
fulfilled or the amenities installed if it specifies a date by which or a
schedule according to which such requirements must be met or each amenity
installed and if it concludes that compliance will be ensured as the result of
any one or more of the following:
         A.   A performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit or other
security satisfactory to the Planning Commission is furnished;
         B.   A condition is imposed establishing an automatic expiration date
on the permit, thereby ensuring that the permit recipient's compliance will be
reviewed when application for renewal is made;
      (3)   With respect to subdivisions in which the developer is selling only
undeveloped lots, the Council may authorize final plat approval and the sale of
lots before all requirements of this Planning and Zoning Code are fulfilled if
the subdivider provides a performance bond or other security satisfactory to
the City’s Finance Director to ensure that all of these requirements will be
fulfilled within not more than 12 months after final plat approval.
   (b)   Completing Developments in Phases.
      (1)   If a development is constructed in phases or stages subsection (a)
of this section shall apply to each phase as if it were the entire development.
      (2)   As a prerequisite to taking advantage of the provisions this
section, the developer shall submit plans that clearly show the various phases
or stages of the proposed development and the requirements of this Planning and
Zoning Code that will be satisfied with respect to each phase or stage.
      (3)   If a development that is to be built in phases or stages includes
improvements that are designed to relate to, benefit, or be used by the entire
development (such as a swimming pool or tennis courts in a residential
development) then, as part of the developer’s application for development
approval, the developer shall submit a proposed schedule for completion of such
improvements. The schedule shall relate completion of such improvements to
completion of one or more phases or stages of the entire development. Once a
schedule has been approved and made part of the permit by the permit issuing
authority, no land may be used, no buildings may be occupied, and no
subdivision lots may be sold except in accordance with the schedule approved as
part of the permit, provided that:
         A.   If the improvement is one required by this Planning and Zoning
Code, then the developer may utilize the provisions of subsection (a)(1) or (3)
hereof.
         B.   If the improvement is an amenity not required by this Planning
and Zoning Code or is provided in response to a condition imposed by the
Planning Commission, then the developer may utilize the provisions of
subsection (a)(2) hereof.
   (c)   Expiration of Permits.
      (1)   Zoning and conditional use permits shall expire automatically if,
within one year after the issuance of such permits:
         A.   The use authorized by such permits has not commenced; in
circumstances where no substantial construction, erection, alteration,
excavation, demolition, or similar work is necessary before commencement of
such use; or,
         B.   Less than ten (10) percent of the total cost of all construction,
erection, alteration, excavation, demolition, or similar work on any
development authorized by such permits has been completed on the site. With
respect to phased development, this requirement shall apply only to the first
phase.
      (2)   If, after some physical alteration to land or structures begins to
take place, such work is discontinued for a period of one year, then the permit
authorizing such work shall immediately expire. However, expiration of the
permit shall not affect the provisions of subsection (d) hereof.
      (3)   The permit-issuing authority may extend for a period up to six (6)
months the date when a permit would otherwise expire pursuant to subsections
(c)(1) or (2) of this Section if the issuing authority concludes that:
         A.   The permit has not yet expired; and
         B.   The permit recipient has proceeded with due diligence and in good
faith, and conditions have not changed so substantially as to warrant a new
application. Successive extensions may be granted for periods up to six months
upon the same findings. All such extensions may be granted by the Zoning
Administrator without resort to the formal processes and fees required for a
new permit.
      (4)   For purposes of this Section, the permit within the jurisdiction of
the Council or the Board of Zoning Appeals is issued when the permit is signed
under the authority of the issuing body by the Zoning Administrator.
      (5)   Notwithstanding any of the provisions of Chapter
1129, this Section shall be applicable to permits issued prior to the effective
date of this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (d)   Effect of Permit on Successors and Assigns. Zoning and conditional-use
permits authorize the permittee to make use of land and structures in a
particular way. Such permits are transferable, unless otherwise specifically
designated nontransferable. However, so long as the land or structures or any
portion thereof covered under a permit continues to be used for the purposes
for which the permit was granted, then:
      (1)   No person (including successors or assigns of the person who
obtained the permit) may make use of the land or structures covered under such
permit for the purposes authorized in the permit except in accordance with all
the terms and requirements of that permit; and
      (2)   The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and restrict the
use of land or structures covered under the permit, not only with respect to
all persons having any interest in the property at the time the permit was
obtained, but also with respect to persons who subsequently obtain any interest
in all or part of the covered property and wish to use it for or in connection
with purposes for which the permit was issued, unless otherwise restricted by
the terms of the permit, other than those for which the permit was originally
issued, so long as the persons who subsequently obtain an interest in the
property had actual or record notice (as provided in subsection (d)(3) of this
Section) of the existence of the permit at the time they acquired their
interest.
      (3)   Whenever a conditional-use permit is issued to authorize
development (other than single-family or two-family dwellings) on a tract of
land in excess of one acre, nothing authorized by the permit may be done until
the record owner of the property signs a written acknowledgment that the permit
has been issued so that the permit may be recorded in the Henry County Registry
and indexed under the record owner's name as grantor, recording fee to be at
the expense of the recipient.
   (e)   Amendments to and Modifications of Permits.
      (1)   Insignificant deviations from the permits and minor design
modifications issued or authorized by the permit-issuing authority are
permissible by approval of the Zoning Administrator. A deviation is
insignificant if it has no discernible impact on neighboring properties, the
general public, or those intended to occupy or use the proposed development.
      (2)   All other requests for changes in approved plans will be processed
as new applications. If such requests are required to be acted upon by the
Council or the Planning Commission, new conditions may be imposed in accordance
with this Planning and Zoning Code, but the applicant retains the right to
reject such additional conditions by withdrawing the request for an amendment
and may then proceed in accordance with the previously issued permit.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether amendments to and
modifications of permits fall within the categories set forth above in
subsections (e)(1) and (2) of this Section.
      (4)   A developer requesting approval of changes shall submit a written
request for such approval to the Zoning Administrator, and that request shall
identify the changes. Approval of all changes must be given in writing.

1143.01 PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
   The regulations contained in this Chapter are established to encourage
imaginative design and to provide relief from zoning requirements which were
devised for conventional developments and which may inhibit innovation.
Additionally, each of the individual types of planned development regulations
were created for the purposes stated in subsections (a) through (d), both
inclusive.
   (a)   Planned Apartment Development. The Planned Apartment Development
regulations are established to provide a safe and desirable living environment
characterized by a unified building and site development plan, to preserve
natural features of the site, and to provide adequate open space for recreation
and other outdoor living purposes.
   (b)   Planned Commercial Development. The Planned Commercial Development
regulations are established to strengthen the economic viability and to enhance
the aesthetic qualities of the commercial district through the promotion of
larger scale developments of unified design; and to increase the total value of
commercial property for the benefit of the owner and the community.
   (c)   Planned Cluster Development. The Planned Cluster Development
regulations are established to permit the clustering of single-family dwellings
on reduced size lots to achieve more desirable developments by the creation of
common open space equal in area to the reduction in lot size and thereby
increase the total value of the development for the benefit of the property
owner and the community. Cluster Developments are intended to encourage a break
from monotonous rectilinear and curvilinear lot and street patterns that are
common subdivision practices.
   (d)   Planned Residential Development (PRD). The Planned Residential
Development regulations are established to permit developments constructed on a
tract of land at least five (5) acres under single ownership, planned and
developed as an integral unit, and consisting of single-family detached
dwellings combined with either two family dwellings or multi-family dwellings,
or both.
      (Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1143.02 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The following standards shall be utilized by the Planning Commission in
reviewing all site and building plans. These standards are intended to provide
a frame of reference for the applicant in the development of site and building
plans as well as a method of review for the Planning Commission. These
standards shall not be regarded as inflexible requirements. They are not
intended to discourage creativity, invention, and innovation.
   (a)   Relation of Proposed Building to Environment. Proposed structures
shall be related harmoniously to the terrain and to existing buildings in the
vicinity that have a visual relationship to the proposed buildings. The
achievement of such relationship may include the enclosure of space in
conjunction with other existing buildings or other proposed buildings and the
creation of focal points with respect to avenues of approach, terrain features
or other buildings.
   (b)   Drives, Parking, and Circulation. With respect to vehicular and
pedestrian circulation, including walkways, interior drives, and parking,
special attention shall be given to location and number of access points to the
public streets, width of interior drives and access points, general interior
circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and arrangement of
parking areas that are safe and convenient, and insofar as practicable, do not
detract from the design of proposed buildings, structures and/or the
neighboring properties.
   (c)   Surface Water Drainage.  Special attention shall be given to proper
site surface drainage so that removal of surface waters will not adversely
affect neighboring properties or the public storm drainage system. Storm water
shall be removed from all roofs, canopies, and paved areas and carried away in
an underground drainage system or the approved method of surface water
disposal. Surface water in all paved areas shall be collected at intervals so
that it will not obstruct the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic and will
not create puddles in the paved areas.
   (d)   Utility Service. Electric lines, telephone lines cable, internet and
fiber optic lines shall be all underground. Any utility installations remaining
above ground shall be located so as to have a harmonious relation to
neighboring properties and the site. The proposed method of sanitary sewage
disposal from all buildings shall be indicated.
   (e)   Advertising Features. The size, location, design, color, texture,
lighting and materials of all permanent signs and outdoor advertising
structures or features shall not detract from the design of proposed building
and structure and the surrounding properties.
   (f)   Special Features. Exposed storage area, exposed machinery
installations, service areas, truck loading area, utility buildings and
structures, and similar accessory areas and structures shall be subject to such
setbacks, screen plantings or other screening methods to reasonably prevent
their being incongruous with the existing or contemplated environment and the
surrounding properties.

Commission finds that the proposed development conforms to the design standards
of City Code Section
1143.02. Open space resulting from reduced lot size shall be utilized in
accordance with subsection (c)(3) hereof.
   (c)   Development Standards.
      (1)   The number of dwelling units within a Planned Cluster Development
shall be determined by dividing the net land area of the subject property by
the area of the minimum lot size permitted for the zoning classification, in
which the development is located. In the event that the subject property is
classified in two or more zoning classifications, the density shall be
determined by using the net land area described above for each zoning
classification; and
      (2)   The open space resulting from the Cluster Development of reduced
lot sizes shall be considered common open space for the enjoyment and benefit
of all residents of the development. Primary access from such common open space
to each building site need not be provided; however, convenient access through
permanent easement must be provided and perpetually guaranteed to all residents
of the development. Open space included with the Cluster Development shall not
be utilized for future residential building sites or for accessory buildings;
and
      (3)   All or any part of the open space may be dedicated to the City and
operated as a City recreational facility; provided however, that no substantial
permanent improvements above ground shall be permitted; and
      (4)   If the open space is not dedicated to the City, the space to be
reserved for use by resident property owners shall be assigned to a home-owners
association or some comparable type of organization establishing common
ownership and maintenance criteria for all common open space. Such ownership
document shall be submitted to and approved by the Planning Commission; and
      (5)   Open off-street parking areas shall be screened with shrubbery,
trees, or decorative fence if said parking area is designed for six or more
vehicles. Such screening shall be included in the development plan.
   (d)   Required Plans, Plats, and Procedures.
      (1)   Any applicant for a Planned Cluster Development under these
regulations shall file an application with the Zoning Administrator. The
application shall include all the following information:
         A.   A statement describing the general character of the intended
development, together with such pertinent information as may be necessary to
determine that the contemplated development conforms to the requirements of
this Planning and Zoning Code and the general and specific standards
established herein.
         B.   A site plan indicating the arrangement and location of buildings,
uses proposed, open space and landscaped area, pedestrian walkways, parking and
loading spaces and facilities and other special features of the development
plan.
         C.   Architectural elevations and perspective drawings of all proposed
structures and improvements.
         D.   A landscape plan, including a comprehensive drainage plan.
         E.   Ownership declaration: such declaration shall be filed with the
Zoning Administrator during the application filing if the Planned Cluster
Development premise is proposed to be in condominium ownership. Articles of
incorporation and declaration of covenants and restrictions shall be examined
and evaluated by the Planning Commission, in terms of statement of purpose,
standards and requirements contained therein. Planned Cluster Development shall
be recommended to the City Council for approval, only after a determination has
been made that the proposed development does in fact serves such purpose and
complies with such standards and requirements pursuant to this Planning and
Zoning Code.
      (2)   The Planned Cluster Development shall be examined and evaluated by
the Planning Commission in terms of the statement of purpose contained herein.
Recommendation for approval may be made only after a determination has been
made that the proposed development does in fact serve such purpose as contained
in this Planning and Zoning Code.
         (Ord. 074-10. Passed 12-20-10.)
1143.06 PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   Planned Residential Developments (PRDs) are permissible only on tracts
of at least five acres located within Zoning districts as found in Chapter
1145; and
   (b)   The overall density of a tract developed by a PRD shall be finally
determined by Council; and,
   (c)   Permissible types of residential uses within a PRD include single-
family detached dwellings, two-family dwellings, and multi-family dwellings. At
least fifty (50) percent of the total number of dwelling units must be single-
family detached dwellings on lots of at least 7,000 square feet; and
   (d)   A PRD shall be an architecturally integrated subdivision; and
   (e)   To the extent practicable, the two-family and multi-family portions of
a PRD shall be developed more toward the interior rather than the periphery of
the tract so that the single- family detached dwellings border adjacent
properties; and
   (f)   In a Planned Residential Development, the screening requirements that
would normally apply where two-family or multi-family development adjoins a
single-family development shall not apply within the tract developed as a
Planned Residential Development, but all screening requirements shall apply
between the tract so developed and adjacent lot.
   (g)   The Planned Residential Development must be approved in two steps, (1)
a preliminary site plan to be submitted to the Planning Commission so that they
can recommend the approval or disapproval to Council and (2) a final
development plan to be submitted to the Planning Commission so that they can
recommend the approval or disapproval to Council.
   (h)   Any applicant for a Planned Residential Development under these
regulations shall file an application with the Zoning Administrator. The
application shall include all the following information:
      (1)   A statement describing the general character of the intended
development together with such pertinent information as may be necessary to
determine that the contemplated development conforms to the requirements of
this Planning and Zoning Code and the general and specific standards
established herein.
      (2)   A site plan indicating the arrangement and tentative location of
buildings, uses proposed, open space and landscaped areas, pedestrian walkway
area, parking and loading spaces and facilities, and other special features of
the development plan.
      (3)   Architectural elevations and perspective drawings of all proposed
structures and improvements.
      (4)   A landscaping plan including a comprehensive drainage plan.
   (i)   The Planned Residential Development shall be examined and evaluated by
the Planning Commission in terms of the statement of purpose contained herein
and the Planning Commission may recommend such Planned Residential Development
for approval by the City Council only after a determination has been made that
the proposed development does in fact serve such purpose as contained in this
Planning and Zoning Code.

CHAPTER 1145
Table of Permissible Uses
1145.01   Table of Permissible Uses.
 
CROSS REFERENCES
Uses defined - see P. & Z. Ch.

1145.01 TABLE OF PERMISSIBLE USES.
   The Table of Permissible Uses should be read in close conjunction with the
definitions of terms set forth in Definitions of Basic Terms and the other
interpretive provisions set forth in this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (a)   Use of the Designation “P” and “C” in Table of Permissible Uses. When
used in connection with a particular use in the Table of Permissible Uses, the
letter “P” means that the use is permissible in the indicated zone with a
zoning permit issued by the Zoning Administrator. When the letter “P” is
nonexistent in the Table, then it shall be deemed a nonpermissive use unless a
special use or conditional use permit is approved in accordance with this
Zoning Code.
In the zone district. When used in connection with a particular use in the
Table of Permissible Uses, the letter "C" means that the use may be permissible
with a conditional use permit in the indicated zone as may be issued by the
Zoning Administrator upon approval by the Council after Planning Commission
review.
   (b)   Jurisdiction Over Uses Otherwise Permissible with a Zoning Permit.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Planning and Zoning Code, whenever
the Table of Permissible Uses (interpreted in light of subsection (a) hereof
and the other provisions of this Planning and Zoning Code) provides that a use
is permissible with a zoning permit, and/or a conditional use permit, as
applicable, shall nevertheless be required if the Zoning Administrator finds
that the proposed use would have an extraordinary impact on neighboring
properties or the general public. In making this determination, the Zoning
Administrator shall consider, among other factors, whether the use constitutes
a change from one principal use classification to another, whether the use is
proposed for a site that poses peculiar traffic or other hazards or
difficulties, and whether the proposed use is substantially unique or is likely
to have impacts that differ substantially from those presented by other uses
that are permissible in the zoning district in question.
   (c)   Permissible Uses and Specific Exclusions.
      (1)   The presumption established by this Planning and Zoning Code is
that all legitimate uses of land, except those uses which, if allowed, would
not serve to promote public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity or
general welfare, are permissible within at least one zoning district in the
City's planning jurisdiction. Therefore, because the list of permissible uses
set forth in (Table of Permissible Uses) cannot be all inclusive, those uses
that are listed shall be interpreted liberally to include other uses that have
similar impacts to the listed uses, subject to the issuance of a conditional
use permit.
      (2)   The "Table of Permissible Uses" shall not be interpreted to allow a
use in one zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to
another specified use that is permissible in other zoning districts.
      (3)   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions, the
following uses (a) through (d) are specifically prohibited in all districts:
         A.   Any use that involves the manufacture, handling, sale,
distribution, or storage of any highly combustible or explosive materials in
violation of the City's Fire Prevention Code.
         B.   Stockyards, slaughterhouses, and rendering plants.
         C.   Use of a travel trailer as a temporary or permanent dwelling.
         D.   Use of a motor vehicle parked on a lot as a structure in which,
out of which, or from which any goods are sold or stored, any services are
performed, or other business is conducted.
   (d)   Accessory Uses.
      (1)   The Table of Permissible Uses classifies different principal uses
according to their different impacts.
      (2)   Accessory use, or accessory: an "accessory use" is a use that is
clearly incidental to, customarily found in connection with, and (except in
case of accessory off-street parking spaces or loading) located on the same
zoning lot as the principal use to which it is related. When "accessory" is
used in the text, it shall have the same meaning as "accessory use". An
"accessory use" includes, but is not limited to, the following:
         A.   Swimming pools for use of occupants of a residence or their
guests.
         B.   Domestic or agricultural storage in a barn, shed, tool room, or
similar accessory building or other structure.
         C.   Home occupations when carried on by the owner-resident of the
dwelling when no physical or visual affects are observed beyond the walls of
the dwelling.
         D.   Storage of merchandise normally carried in stock in connection
with a business or industrial use, unless such storage is excluded in the
applicable district regulations.
         E.    Storage of goods used in or produced by industrial uses or
related activities, unless such storage is excluded in the applicable district
regulations.
         F.    Accessory off-street parking regulations for the district in
which the zoning lot is located.
         G.    Accessory signs, subject to the sign regulations for the
district in which the zoning lot is located.
         H.    Satellite antenna or microwave receiving antenna, following all
regulations set forth in Section
1127.20.
      (4)   The following activities shall not be regarded as accessory to a
residential principal use and are prohibited in residential districts.
         A.   Storage outside of a substantially enclosed structure of any
motor vehicle that is unlicensed and not operational.
         B.   Parking outside a substantially enclosed structure of more than
four motor vehicles between the front building line of the principal building
and the street on any lot used for purposes that fall within the permitted use
in a residential district.
   (e)   Permissible Uses Not Requiring Zoning Permits. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Planning and Zoning Code, no zoning, or conditional-
use permit is necessary for the following uses:
      (1)   Streets.
      (2)   Electric power, telephone, telegraph, fiber optic cable, cable
television, gas, water, and sewer lines, wires or pipes, together with
supporting poles or structures, located within a public right-of-way, except
that a use of right-of-way permit may be required by the City.
      (3)   Neighborhood utility facilities located within a public right-of-
way with the permission of the owner or controller (state or city) of the
right-of-way.
   (f)   Change in Use.
      (1)   A substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the
essential character or nature of the activity conducted on a lot changes. This
occurs whenever:
         A.   The change involves a change from one principal use category to
another; or
         B.   If the original use is a Combination Use or Planned Development,
the relative proportion of space devoted to the individual principal use that
comprises the Combination Use or Planned Development Use changes to such an
extent that the parking requirements for the overall use are altered; or
         C.   If the original use is a Combination Use or Planned Development
Use, the mixture of types of individual principal uses that comprise the
Combination Use or Planned Development Use changes; or
         D.   If the original use is a Planned Residential Development, the
relative proportions of different types of dwelling units change; or
         E.   If there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot
(regardless of whether that business or enterprise consists of one individual
principal use or a Combination Use), that business or enterprise moves out and
a different type of enterprise moves in (even though the new business or
enterprise may be classified under the same principal use or Combination Use
category as the previous type of business). For illustration purposes only, if
there is only one building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant
of the building moves out and is replaced by a clothing store, which
constitutes a change in use even though both tenants fall within a permitted
principal Use. However, if the florist shop were replaced by another florist
shop, that would not constitute a change in use since the type of business or
enterprise would not have changed. Moreover, if the florist shop moved out of a
rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store, that
would not constitute a change in use since there is more than one business on
the lot and the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot
(shopping center, Combination Use) has not changed.
      (2)   A mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied
or vice versa does not constitute a change in use. Whether a change in use
occurs shall be determined by comparing the two active uses of the property
without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have
been unoccupied, unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than 181
consecutive days or has been abandoned.
   (g)   Combination Uses.
      (1)   When a Combination Use comprises two or more principal uses that
require different types of permits, then the permit authorizing the Combination
Use shall be a conditional use permit along with a zoning permit.
      (2)   When a Combination Use consists of a single-family detached
residential subdivision that is not architecturally integrated and two-family
or multi- family uses, the total density permissible on the entire tract shall
be determined by having the developer indicate on the plans the portion of the
total lot that will be developed for each purpose and calculating the density
for each portion as if it were a separate lot.
      (3)   When a Combination Use consists of a single-family detached,
architecturally integrated subdivision two-family or multi-family uses, then
the total density permissible on the entire tract shall be determined by
dividing the area of the tract by the minimum square footage per dwelling unit
specified therein.
   (h)   More Specific Use Controls. Whenever a development could fall within
more than one use classification in the Table of Permissible Uses, the use
classification that most closely and most specifically describes the
development controls.

   Building setback lines shall be required along all public streets. Any yard
abutting a street shall be deemed a front yard for the purpose of determining
front building setback lines.
   In residential districts as it relates to residential uses, where 25% or
more of the lots in the block frontage are occupied by buildings, the average
setback of such buildings determines the dimension of the front yard in the
block frontage, but the front yard need not exceed 50 feet in any case.
   Building setback lines established in a recorded subdivision shall establish
the dimension of front yards in such subdivisions.
   In case of conflict with the front setback requirements of this zoning
district, conditional uses, or other applicable provisions of this Planning and
Zoning Code, the most restrictive requirement shall govern.
   On through or corner lots, front yards shall be provided from each street
with the same setback requirements.

      (1)   A notice of application shall have been given to the owners of lots
adjoining the lot from which the building or structure is to be removed or
demolished.
      (2)   The owner or agent of the building or structure shall notify all

purpose of obtaining written releases stating that their respective service
connections and appurtenant equipment, such as meters and regulators, have been
removed or sealed and plugged in a safe manner.
      (3)   A certificate shall be obtained from the Henry County Department of
Health, stating that the building or structure either has no rats, pigeons, or
vermin, or that the building or structure shall be exterminated by a commercial
exterminator prior to demolition or removal work.
      (4)   Every contractor for the removal of asbestos, toxic chemicals, and/
or hazardous materials from the demolition or removal site shall produce for
inspection by the Building Inspector of the City true and complete certified
copies of:
         A.   Any and all licenses issued therefor by the Ohio Department of

         B.   Any and all licenses issued for the disposal site thereof by the

hazardous materials at the demolition or removal site; and
         D.   Any and all compliances required by the Federal Occupational

hazardous materials found at such site. Every such contractor shall remove and
dispose of all such asbestos, toxic chemicals, and/or hazardous materials from
the demolition or removal site in the manner required by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency. To assure compliance with these provisions, the Building
Inspector of the City may require of every such contractor such additional
information and documentation as he may reasonably request from time to time.
   (c)   A certificate of insurance shall be filed with the Building Inspector
which shall provide for bodily injury liability for not less than $500,000 per
person and $1,000,000 per incident, and property damage liability in the sum of
$2,000,000. Liability insurance shall not be required under the following
conditions:
      (1)   Demolition is being done by the owner as the prime contractor;
provided, the owner must hold title to the land and building or structure.
      (2)   Demolition is being done by a governmental agency.
   (d)   Demolition or removal of any building or structure shall be completed
within 90 days from the time the permit is issued. Additional time may be
granted if a written letter is submitted to the Building Inspector explaining
circumstances.
   (e)   For purposes of this section, "completion of demolition or removal"
means that the vacant lot shall be filled, graded, and maintained in conformity
to the existing lot grade. The lot shall be maintained free from the
accumulation of rubbish and all other unsafe or hazardous conditions which
endanger the life or health of the public; and provisions shall be made to
prevent the accumulation of water or damage to any foundations on the premises
or the adjoining property.
   (f)   Additional requirements, unless otherwise deemed unnecessary by the
Building Inspector and waived in writing by the Building Inspector:
      (1)   During demolition, portable fire extinguishers shall be readily

Building Inspector. All fences shall be of adequate strength to resist wind
pressure.
      (3)   Material shall not be dropped by gravity or thrown outside the
exterior walls of a building during demolition or removal. Wood or metal chutes
shall be provided for this purpose and any material which in its removal will
cause an excessive amount of dust shall be wet down to prevent the creation of
a nuisance.
   (g)   Any building or structure demolished or removed shall have the
sanitary and storm sewers capped in an approved method and shall be inspected

         A.   One hundred dollars ($100.00)
      (3)   Small buildings. There shall be no permit fee imposed for
demolition or moving of buildings of 200 square feet or less. This does not
constitute a waiver of any of the provisions of this section, such as a waiver
of the requirement to obtain a permit or the right to inspect the site.
   (i)   In the event that work is being performed without proper permits when
required, the fees contained in this schedule shall triple. If it is necessary
for the Building Inspector to make more than two inspections of a particular
phase demolition or removal, an additional reinspection fee of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) shall be charged.
(Ord. 021-18. Passed 5-21-18.)

   1325.05 UNSAFE BUILDINGS TO BE REMOVED OR REPAIRED.
   No insurance company doing business in the State shall pay a claim of a
named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the City where the
amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all insurance
policies exceeds $5,000 and is greater than or equal to 60% of all fire
insurance policy monetary limitations unless there is compliance with the
following procedures:
   (a)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the
insurance company or insurance companies equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate
limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure,
the insurance company or companies in accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.26(F) shall
transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Finance Director in the aggregate
amount of $2,000 for each $15,000, and each fraction of that amount, of a
claim; or, if at the time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named
insured or insureds and the insurance company or companies, the named insured
or insureds have submitted a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of
removing, repairing, or securing the building or other structure, shall
transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate.
      (1)   Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
companies insuring the building or structure. Policy proceeds remaining after
the transfer to the City may be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms.
      (2)   The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing, or securing the building or other
structure after the transfer, and the Finance Director shall return the amount
of the fund in excess of the estimate to the named insured or insureds,
provided that the City has not commenced to remove, repair, or secure the
building or other structure.
   (b)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the City as authorized by this section the
Finance Director shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely
as security against the total cost of removing, repairing, or securing incurred
by the City pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261.
      (1)   When transferring the fund as required in this section, an
insurance company shall provide the City with the name and address of the named
insured or insureds, whereupon the City shall contact the named insured or
insureds, certify that the proceeds have been received by the City, and notify
them that the following procedures will be followed:
         A.   The fund shall be returned by the Finance Director to the named
insured or insureds when repairs, removal or securing of the building or other
structure have been completed no later than 60 days after the required proof is
received by the Finance Director, provided that the City has not incurred any
costs for those repairs, removal, or securing.
         B.   If the City has incurred any costs for repairs, removal or
securing of the building or other structure, the costs shall be paid from the
fund, and if excess funds remain, the City shall transfer, no later than 60
days after all such costs have been paid, the remaining funds to the named
insured or insureds after repair, rebuilding, or removal has been completed.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of
the City to recover any deficiency under Ohio R.C. 715.261.
      (3)   Nothing in Ohio R.C. 3929.86(C) and (D), shall be construed to
prohibit the City and the named insured or insureds from entering into an
agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured or insureds
if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been
negotiated.
(Ord. 052-07. Passed 7-2-07.)

(Ord. 047-06. Passed 6-5-06.)
PURPOSE AND SCOPE
   1335.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Sign Code is to establish standards for the fabrication,
erection and use of signs, symbols, markings and advertising devices within the
City. These standards are designed to protect and promote the public welfare,
health and safety of persons with the community and to aid in the development
and promotion of business and industry by providing sign regulations which
encourage aesthetic creativity, effectiveness and flexibility in the design and
use of such devices without creating detriment to the general public.
   (a)   This Sign Code authorizes the use of signs provided they meet all of
the following:
      (1)   Compatible with their surroundings, pursuant to the objectives of
proper design and zoning amenities;
      (2)   Designed, installed, and maintained to meet the sign user’s needs
while at the same time promoting the amenable environment desired by the
general public;
      (3)   Designed, constructed, installed and maintained in such a manner
that they do not endanger public safety or traffic safety;
      (4)   Legible, readable, and visible in the circumstance in which they
are used; and,
      (5)   Respectful of the reasonable rights of other advertisers whose
messages are displayed.
   (b)   It is the intent of this Sign Code to coordinate the type, placement
and scale of signs within the different land-use zones to recognize the
commercial communication requirements of all sectors of the business community;
to promote both renovation and proper maintenance; to allow for special
circumstances; and to guarantee equal treatment under the law through accurate
record keeping and consistent enforcement. The use of signs is regulated
according to zone. The placement and scale of signs are regulated primarily by
type and length of street frontage, though lot size, investment and surrounding
conditions must also be considered.
(Ord. 047-06. Passed 6-5-06.)

      (1)   A literal application of the Code would not allow the property to
be used at its highest and best use as zoned.
      (2)   The granting of the requested variance would not be materially
detrimental to the property owners in the vicinity.
      (3)   Hardship caused the sign user under a literal interpretation of the
Code is due to conditions unique to that property and does not apply generally
to the City.
      (4)   The granting of the variance would not be contrary to the general
objectives of this Code and the land use plan.
   (b)   In granting a variance, the Administrator may attach additional
conditions and requirements necessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of
this code in the public's best interest.
(Ord. 047-06. Passed 6-5-06.)
   1335.30 VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   When, in the opinion of the Administrator, a violation of the Sign
Code exists but such violation does not pose an immediate danger to the public,
the Administrator shall issue a written order to the alleged violator. The
order shall specify those sections of the Code which the individual may be in
violation of and shall state that the individual has thirty days from the date
of the order in which to correct the alleged violation or to appeal.
   (b)   If, upon inspection, the Administrator finds that any sign is
abandoned or structurally, materially or electrically defective, or in any
other way endangers the public, the Administrator shall issue a written order
to the owner of the sign and occupant of the premises stating the nature of the
violation and requiring them to repair or remove the sign within fifteen days
of the date of the order or to appeal.
   (c)   In cases of emergency, where a sign poses an immediate danger to the
public, the Administrator may cause the immediate removal of a dangerous or
defective sign without notice. Signs removed in this manner must present a
hazard to the public safety as defined in the enforceable Building or Traffic
Codes.
(Ord. 047-06. Passed 6-5-06.)
 
   1335.31 REMOVAL OF SIGNS BY ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   The Administrator may cause the removal of an illegal sign in cases of
emergency, or for failure to comply with the written orders of removal or
repair. After removal or demolition of the sign, a notice shall be mailed to
the sign owner, if known, and property owner stating the nature of the work and
the date on which it was performed and demanding payment of the costs of
removal which shall include incidental expenses incurred by the City in
connection with the sign’s removal or demolition as certified by the
Administrator.
   (b)   If the amount specified in the notice as provided in paragraph (a) of
this section is not paid within sixty days of the notice. The City may file
suit in court to collect the costs and, to the extent permitted by law, the
cost of removal or demolition may be levied as an assessment against the lot on
which the sign is located.
   (c)   The owner of the lot upon which the sign is located shall be presumed
to be the owner of all signs thereon unless facts to the contrary are brought
to the attention of the Administrator, as in the case of a leased sign.
   (d)   For purposes of removal, the definition of sign shall include all sign
embellishments and structures designed specifically to support the sign.
(Ord. 047-06. Passed 6-5-06.)
   1335.32 APPEALS.
   (a)   Any holder or applicant of a sign permit has thirty days of receipt of
any decision rendered by the Administrator in denying a permit or variance to
appeal the decision to the Board of Building Appeals or in the event no such
Board exists or is unable to meet in quorum, then to another Administrative
Appeals Board as determined by City Council for review and final determination.
The appeal shall be filed with the Clerk of Council accompanied with a fee of
thirty-five dollars ($35.00). The Board shall review the appeal and shall issue
its determination no later than forty-five days after receipt of the appeal.
Such appeal shall be limited in scope as to whether or not the Administrator
abused his or her discretion or was arbitrary or capricious in denying the
issuance of the requested permit or variance. Such hearing shall be recorded
with sworn testimony. In the event that the person appealing prevails with the
Board, the thirty-five dollars ($35.00) fee shall be reimbursed.
(Ord. 012-12. Passed 2-6-12.)
   (b)   The action being appealed shall be held in abeyance pending the
decision of the Board. No fines shall be levied during the appeal process. The
appeal process does not bar the Administrator from removing a sign in an
emergency condition."

GENERAL PROVISIONS
   1339.01 FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE.
   (a)   Findings of Fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss.
   (b)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to do
the following:
      (1)   Protect human life and health.
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains; electric, telephone, and sewer lines; streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazards.
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas.
      (7)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in an area
of special flood hazard.
      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
   (c)   Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter includes methods and provisions for the following:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities.
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve those uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction.
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters.
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage.
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

   This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the City as identified by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, including any additional flood hazard areas annexed by the City of
Napoleon that are not identified on the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map.
(Ord. 103-95. Passed 10-16-95.)
   1339.04 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   The areas of special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled
"Flood Insurance Study for the City of Napoleon, Ohio." This study, with
accompanying flood boundary and floodway maps and flood insurance rate maps
dated November 2, 1995 which are currently on file in the office of the City
Engineer are hereby adopted and declared to be a part of this chapter.
(Ord. 106-95. Passed 11-6-95.)
   1339.05 COMPLIANCE.
   Unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit as stated
in Section 1339.10, no structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged, or altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and all other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
(1978 Code 155.05)

another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(1978 Code 155.06)
   1339.07 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall
be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

state statutes. Where a provision of this chapter may be in conflict with a
state law, the state law shall take precedence over the chapter.
(1978 Code 155.07)
   1339.08 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.
(1978 Code 155.08)
ADMINISTRATION
   1339.09 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A development permit shall be obtained from the City Engineer before
construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard
established in Section
1339.04. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished
by the City Engineer and may include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate
drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the
area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials,
drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the
following information is required:
   (a)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor, including
basement, of all proposed structures located in special flood hazard areas
where base flood elevation data are utilized;
   (b)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any proposed
structure will be floodproofed in accordance with Section
1339.15(b)(1) where base flood elevation data are utilized;
   (c)   Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that
the floodproofing methods for a nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing
criteria in Section
1339.15(b)(1) where base flood elevation data are utilized; and
   (d)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development and certification by a registered
professional engineer that the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will
not be diminished.
(Ord. 103-95. Passed 10-16-95.)
   1339.10 EXEMPTION FROM FILING FOR DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   An application for a development permit shall not be required for
maintenance work such as roofing, painting, and basement sealing, or for small
development activities (except for filling and grading) valued at less than
$1,000. Any proposed action exempt from filing for a development permit is also
exempt from the standards of this chapter.
(Ord. 103-95. Passed 10-16-95.)
   1339.11 DESIGNATION OF FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION CHAPTER ADMINISTRATOR.
   The City Engineer is hereby appointed to administer and implement this
chapter by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance
with its provisions.
(1978 Code 155.17)
   1339.12 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CITY ENGINEER.
   The duties and responsibilities of the City Engineer shall include, but are
not limited to, the following:
   (a)   Permit Review.
      (1)   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
      (2)   Review all development permits to assure that all necessary permits
have been received from those federal, state or local governmental agencies

obtaining such permits as required including permits issued by the Department
of the Army under §10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and §404 of the Clean Water
Act.
      (3)   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located within a designated floodway. Floodways are delineated
in the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the
Flood Insurance Study. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of
flood information. If the proposed development is located within a designated
floodway, assure that the encroachment provision of Section 1339.16(a) is met.
   (b)   Use of Other Base Flood Elevation and Floodway Data. Areas of special
flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency in accordance with Section
1339.04 are designated as Zone A on the City's Flood Insurance Rate Map. Within
these areas, the City Engineer shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or
other source in order to administer Section
1339.15(a) to (c).
   (c)   Information to Be Obtained and Maintained. Where base flood elevation
data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on the City's Flood
Hazard Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map, regardless of the source of
such data, the following provisions apply:
      (1)   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and whether or not such structures contain an enclosure
below the lowest floor.
      (2)   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures:
         A.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which the structure was floodproofed; and

   (e)   Interpretation of Flood Boundaries. Make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Where a map boundary and
elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile
shall prevail. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
Section
1339.13.
(Ord. 103-95. Passed 10-16-95.)
   1339.13 VARIANCE PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Appeal Board.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals as established by the City shall hear
and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it
is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the City Engineer in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
      (3)   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals or
any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Henry County Court of Common
Pleas, as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
      (4)   In passing upon such applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (5)   Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (a)(4) hereof and
the purposes of this chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (6)   The City Engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions
and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon
request.
(1978 Code 155.19(A))
   (b)   Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing all items in subsection (4)(a) through
(k) hereof have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the
one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      (2)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
      (3)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon the following:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and,
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in
subsection (a)(4) hereof, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
(Ord. 103-95. Passed 10-16-95.)
PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
   1339.14 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazard, the following standards are required.
   (a)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic or hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      (2)   All manufactured homes not otherwise regulated by the Ohio Revised
Code pertaining to manufactured home parks shall be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Methods
of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top and
frame ties to ground anchors.
   (b)   Construction Materials and Methods.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.

   1339.16 FLOODWAYS.
   The Flood Insurance Study referenced in Section
1339.04 identifies a segment within areas of special flood hazard known as a
floodway. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in Section
1339.12(b). The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential.
The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:
   (a)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development unless a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practices demonstrates that
the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (b)   If subsection (a) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Sections
1339.14,
1339.15 and this section.
   (c)   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an increase
in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency. Such requests must be submitted by the
City Engineer to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and must meet the
requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
      (Ord. 103-95. Passed 10-16-95.)
   1339.99 PENALTY.
   Any person, firm, corporation or other entity who violates this chapter or
fails to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions of and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
upon conviction thereof be fined not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more
than one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each violation. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation. The owner or tenant of any building,
structure, premises, or part thereof, and any architect, building contractor,
realtor, agent, or other person who commits, participates in, assists in, or
maintains the violation may each be found guilty of a separate offense, and
suffer the penalties herein provided.
