ADOPTING ORDINANCE NO. 1019
AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES OF THE VILLAGE
OF BURTON, OHIO; TO REPEAL ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH, AND TO PUBLISH THE
ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER, AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of Burton, Ohio, has had the matter of
recodification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such recodification, and
   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council,
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the Village of Burton,
Ohio, County of Geauga and State of Ohio:
   SECTION 1: That the ordinances of the Village of Burton, Ohio, of a general
and permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Burton, Ohio, 1973.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the Village of Burton, Ohio.
   SECTION 2: That the provisions of this ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 4 of this ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to May 1, 1973, which are inconsistent with any provision of the
Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege;
      (2)    The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property;
      (3)    The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment;
      (4)    The assumption of any contract or obligation;
      (5)    The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness;
      (6)    The levy of imposition of taxes, assessments or charges;
      (7)    The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street
or public way;
      (8)    The dedication of property or plat approval;
      (9)    The annexation or detachment of territory;

the Codified Ordinances along with a copy of this ordinance in the five public
places designated. All sections of the Codified Ordinances without a previous
ordinance or resolution history at the end thereof indicate that the sections
contain new matter ordained by this adopting ordinance. A copy of the adopting
ordinance shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the
Village.
   SECTION 4: That this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency
measure, necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, safety,
convenience and welfare of the Village of Burton, and the inhabitants thereof,
for the reason that there exists an imperative necessity for the earliest
publication and distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and
residents of the Village, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation
and avoid practical and legal entanglements, and provided it receives the
necessary vote as required by State law for the passage of emergency
legislation it shall take effect and be in force immediately upon its passage
and approval by the Mayor, otherwise, it shall take effect and be in force at
the earliest period allowed by law.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the 1973 Codified
Ordinances without any history indicate that such sections contain new matter
ordained by the Adopting Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of

continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

and will respond to public records requests in a timely manner. Each request
for public records should be evaluated for a response using the following
guidelines:
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must contact
the requester for clarification, and should assist the requestor in revising
the request by informing the requestor of the manner in which the office keeps
its records.
   (b)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. It is this office's general policy that this
information is not to be requested.
   (c)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be
made available within a reasonable period of time. "Prompt" and "reasonable"
take into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the
location where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review
of the records requested.
   (d)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, etc. If fewer than
twenty (20) pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily
available in an electronic format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily,
these should be made as quickly as the equipment allows. If more copies are
requested, an appointment should be made with the requester on when the copies
or computer files can be picked up. All requests for public records must either
be satisfied or be acknowledged in writing by the (public office) within three
business days following the office's receipt of the request. If a request is
deemed significantly beyond "routine," such as seeking a voluminous number of
copies or requiring extensive research, the acknowledgement must include the
following:
      (1)   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
      (2)   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
      (3)   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
   (e)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. If there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority.
      (Ord. 2450-23. Passed 7-10-23.)
107.04 COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost of making
copies.
   (a)   The charge for paper copies is ten cents ($0.10) per page.
   (b)   The charge for electronic files to a USB is five dollars ($5.00).
   (c)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
   (d)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
      (Ord. 2450-23. Passed 7-10-23.)
107.05 E-MAIL.
   Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office. E-mail
is to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats and should
follow the same retention schedules.
   (a)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business are
subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of this office are
instructed to retain their e-mails that relate to public business (see Section
107.02 Public Records) and to copy them to their business e-mail accounts and/
or to the office's records custodian.
   (b)   The records custodian is to treat the e-mails from private accounts as
records of the public office, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining
them per established schedules and making them available for inspection and
copying in accordance with the Public Records Act.
      (Ord. 2450-23. Passed 7-10-23.)
107.06  FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
   The Village of Burton recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of
failure to properly respond to a public records request. In addition to the
distrust in government that failure to comply may cause, (the public office's)
failure to comply with a request may result in a court ordering (the public
office) to comply with the law and to pay the requester attorney's fees and
damages.

141.03 APPEAL OF PROFESSIONAL FEES.
   (a)   Whenever a person, firm, corporation, or other entity (the
"applicant") is required by ordinance, rule or regulation of this Village to
pay to the Village the fees for review or inspection of a project involving the
applicant by any professional on the Village's behalf (such as the Village's
Engineer, Solicitor, Architect, Landscape Architect, or Hydrogeologist,
hereinafter the "professional") unless such fees have been previously consented
to by the applicant, said applicant shall have the right to appeal to the
Planning Commission the amount of such professional's fees charged to the
applicant.
   (b)   Said appeal shall be initiated within ten days after the fees are
invoiced to the applicant by the Village, by the filing of a written Notice of
Appeal with the Secretary of the Planning Commission, together with a deposit
of an official bank check or certified check, or cash, in the full amount of
the professional's fees which the applicant disputes. Such deposits shall
thereafter be held by the Village until such time as the Planning Commission
renders its decision as set forth below. Said Notice of Appeal shall set forth
a written summary of the applicant's grounds for disputing such fees. The
professional involved shall thereafter file, within seven days, a written
response to the applicant's appeal.
   (c)   No later than ten days after the filing of such response, the Planning
Commission shall conduct a hearing relative to the applicant's appeal. The
Planning Commission shall afford both the applicant and the professional the
opportunity to present witnesses on its own behalf and to cross-examine
evidence of the other.
   (d)   The Planning Commission shall thereafter determine, within seven days
by a majority vote, whether the applicant has demonstrated, by a preponderance
of the evidence, that the professional's fees are unreasonable. Reasonableness
shall be determined based upon the following factors:
      (1)   The terms of the contract between the Village and the professional.
(Hourly rates as established in such contract shall not be subject to challenge
by the applicant.)
      (2)   The complexity of the matter under review by the professional.
      (3)   Any events or circumstances affecting the professional's review
which were beyond the reasonable control of the professional.
      (4)   The amount of time expended on the review by the professional and
the nature of the issues under review.
   (e)   In the event the Planning Commission denies the appeal, the Village
shall immediately utilize the deposit previously referred to herein for the
payment of the professional's fees. In the event the Planning Commission agrees
with the applicant that the professional's fees are unreasonable, then the
Planning Commission shall determine a reasonable amount for such professional
fees and shall thereafter direct the Village to pay to such professional the
amount so determined from the deposit previously referred to herein. The
balance remaining in such deposit shall be remitted to the applicant. Either
the professional or the applicant, or both, may appeal the decision of the
Planning Commission to the Court of Common Pleas under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
The Village shall have no liability to the professional for services rendered
on any project of an applicant for any sums determined under this section to
have been unreasonably charged for such professional's services.

structures in the Village of Burton Historic District be made in the spirit of
their architectural style. Finally, additions to structures may be made in
styles other than the one in which the structure was built, providing that such
additions are architecturally and aesthetically compatible with the original
structure and any later additions up to the date of adoption of this chapter.
It is not the intent of this chapter to limit new construction, alteration, or
repair to any one architectural style. Suggestions of appropriate design
criteria are contained in the Village of Burton Historic District Design Review
Guidelines.
   (d)    Council shall have the power to retain experts to aid in its
deliberations subject to normal financial procedures.
   (e)   Council shall have the power to issue a Historic District Construction
Permit if it approves of the plans submitted for its review. (See Section
 159.13: Role of Zoning Inspector for the procedure that applies.)
   (f)   Council shall conduct or cause to be conducted or assist the
conduction of a continuing survey of all areas, places, buildings, structures,
works of art, or other objects of environmental, aesthetic, historic, or
architectural interest in the Village which Council, on the basis of
information available and presented to it, has reasons to believe are or will
be eligible for designation as a Listed Property or additional Historic
District. No property may be listed and no Historic District shall be
established except upon the approval of Village Council after review and
recommendation by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 2474-24. Passed 7-8-24.)
   159.05 DESIGNATION CRITERIA OF HISTORIC DISTRICTS AND LISTED PROPERTIES.

   159.07 APPLICATION AND NOTICE.
   (a)   Whenever a structure, as defined by this chapter, whether public or
private, within the above-described District is proposed to be newly
constructed or erected, and whenever an existing structure is proposed to be
altered, reconstructed, enlarged, or remodeled, if such alteration,
reconstruction, enlargement, or remodeling involves the exterior design,

(Ord. 2474-24. Passed 7-8-24.)
   159.08 STANDARDS FOR REVIEW; HISTORIC DISTRICT CONSTRUCTION PERMIT.
   (a)   The Board, in deciding whether to issue a Historic District
Construction Permit, shall determine that the Application under consideration
promotes, preserves, and enhances the distinctive historical character of the
community and would not be so at variance with the existing structures within
that portion of the District in which the structure is, or is proposed to be
located, as to be detrimental to the interests of the District. In conducting
its review, Council shall examine all of the elements of the Application within
the framework of the Historic District Design Review Guidelines including, but
not necessarily limited to:
      (1)   Height, which shall include the requirements of Chapter
1139 of the Zoning Code or the requirements of the sections of the Zoning Code
appropriate to the area of the Village in which the structure is or will be
located.
      (2)    Building mass, which shall include the relationship of the
building width to its height and depth, and its relationship to the viewer's
and pedestrian's visual perspective.
      (3)   Window treatment, which shall include the size, shape and materials
of the individual window units and the overall harmonious relationship of
window openings.
      (4)   Exterior detail and relationships, which shall include all
projecting and receding elements of the exterior, including, but not limited
to, porches and overhangs, and the horizontal or vertical expression which is
conveyed by these elements.
      (5)   Roof shape, which shall include type, form and materials.
      (6)   Materials: texture and color, which shall include a consideration
of material compatibility among various elements of the structure.
      (7)    Compatibility of design and details, which shall include the
appropriateness of the use of exterior design details.
      (8)    Landscape design and plant materials, which shall include lighting
and the use of landscape details to accent architectural features or screen or
soften undesirable views.
      (9)   Pedestrian environment, which shall include the provisions of
features which enhance pedestrian movement and environment and which relate to
the pedestrian's visual perspective,
      (10)   Signage: The existing articles of the Village Zoning Ordinance
dealing with signage would apply to a Historic District with the following
additional guidelines:
         A.   Proposed signs should be compatible with the historic, aesthetic,
and architectural character of the building within reasonable limits of size
and placement and compatible with the surrounding streetscape.
         B.    Sign colors should be compatible within the sign itself and
should correlate with building colors.
         C.    Excellent signs already in place should be cited as guides for
future sign-making petitioners.
   (b)   In conducting its inquiry and review, Council may request from the
applicant such additional information, sketches, and data as it shall
reasonably require. It may call upon experts and specialists for testimony and
opinion regarding the matters under consideration. It may recommend to the
applicant changes in the plans that it considers desirable, and may accept a
voluntary amendment to the application to include or reflect such changes.
Council shall keep a record of its proceedings and shall append to the
application copies of information, sketches and data needed to clearly describe
any amendment to it.
   (c)   When its review is concluded, Council will determine, by a vote of its
members, whether the Application for a Historic District Construction Permit
shall be approved. If approved by a majority present, Council shall return the
application and appended material to the Zoning Inspector with the instruction
that the Historic District Construction Permit be issued, provided all other
requirements for a zoning permit and building permit, if applicable, are met.
If not so approved, Council shall cause the return of the application and
appended material to the applicant with a notice that the Historic District
Construction Permit shall not be issued because the application did not meet
the criteria and standards set forth herein.
(Ord. 2474-24. Passed 7-8-24.)
   159.09 FEDERAL TAX CREDITS.
   Once a Historic District Construction Permit has been granted for an
existing structure, the property owner may proceed with the construction,
reconstruction, alteration, renovation, or rehabilitation items included in the
Application as approved. After the issuance of such Historic District
Construction Permit, the owner may apply for any deduction or accelerated
depreciation that may be allowed in accordance with applicable provisions of
the Economic Recovery Act of 1981 and the Tax Reform Act of 1976. Federal law
shall control any such determination.
(Ord. 2474-24. Passed 7-8-24.)
   159.10 ROLE OF ZONING INSPECTOR.
   (a)   The Zoning Inspector shall issue a Historic District Construction
Permit for any new construction or existing structures that have been approved
by Council within seven (7) days of receipt of such approval, providing all
zoning permit requirements have been met. He may approve a Historic District
Construction Permit conditionally approved by Council as soon as the conditions
specified in such conditional approval have been fulfilled. The Zoning
Inspector shall refuse to issue a Historic District Construction Permit for any
application disapproved by Council, but may issue required zoning permits which
meet all other requirements. Should Council lack a quorum, a conditional permit
will be issued subject to Design Review and another meeting will be scheduled
within the twenty day time frame (see Section
159.14) for Historic District Construction Permit Review. The purpose of this
procedure is to eliminate unreasonable delay.
   (b)   The approval, disapproval, or review default of Council shall become a
permanent record in the project file to serve as documentation for approval of
the incentives as outlined in Section
159.11. (Ord. 2474-24. Passed 7-8-24.)
   159.11 APPEALS.
   Any person, firm or corporation, or any officer, department, board, or
agency of the Village who has been aggrieved by any decision of Council
involving an application for approval may appeal such decision to the Geauga
County Common Pleas Court pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Chapter 2506. (Ord.
2474-24. Passed 7-8-24.)
   159.12 DEMOLITION OR MOVING OF HISTORIC STRUCTURES.
   (a)   The demolition or moving of Contributing Buildings within the Historic
District or any non-contiguous Listed Property shall be discouraged. Council
may at its own discretion after due consideration issue a Historic District
Construction Permit for the demolition or moving of such aforementioned
structure. However, in order to grant such a certificate, Council must be
satisfied that the structure meets at least one of the following criteria:
      (1)   The Contributing Building has been deemed by appropriate authority
to be a hazard to public health or safety, and repairs are deemed to be
impossible as determined by the County Building Inspector or his designee;
      (2)    The Contributing Building is a deterrent to a major community
improvement program which the applicant must demonstrate will be of substantial
benefit to the community. This improvement must be shown to have great
potential for increasing surrounding property values and must be shown as a
part of a formally adopted long-range plan or improvement effort;
      (3)    Retention of the Contributing Building would require undue
financial hardship. Such hardship must be proved by the applicant and must be
demonstrated in terms of net loss in value of the structure in question; or
      (4)    The retention of the Contributing Building would not be in the
interest of the community as a whole as is determined by Council in
relationship to formally adopted overall plans for the Village of Burton
Historic District and other such districts and Listed Properties as shall be
designated.
   (b)   In cases where approval for demolition is granted for reasons other
than public health and safety, such Certificate shall not become effective
until two months after the date of such issuance in order to provide a period
of time within which it may be possible to relieve a hardship or to cause the
property to be transferred to another owner who will retain the structure. This
in no way implies approval by the County Building Department, whose approval
must also be secured in addition to the Historic District Construction Permit.
(Ord. 2474-24. Passed 7-8-24.)
   159.13 SEVERABILITY.
   The provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to be severable, and if any
of its provisions shall be held unconstitutional by any court of competent
jurisdiction, the decision of the court shall not impair any of the remaining
provisions.
(Ord. 2474-24. Passed 7-8-24.)
   159.14 ORDINARY MAINTENANCE.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent ordinary maintenance
or repair as defined in Section
159.02 of any structure within the Village of Burton Historic District or
subsequent Listed Properties, nor shall anything in this chapter be construed
to prevent any environmental change, including the construction,
reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any feature which in the view of
the proper authority acting lawfully for the public safety because of an unsafe
or dangerous condition.
(Ord. 2474-24. Passed 7-8-24.)
   159.15 VARIANCES.
   Due to the peculiar conditions of design and construction in historic
neighborhoods where structures were sometimes built close to lot lines, it is
in the public interest to retain a neighborhood's historic appearance by making
variances to normal yard requirements where such a variance does not adversely
interfere with the public health and safety. Where it is deemed that such a
variance is warranted and will not adversely affect neighboring properties,
Council shall recommend appropriate variances to the Zoning Board of Appeals
for their consideration and action. (Ord. 2474-24. Passed 7-8-24.)

         (Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.013 ALLOCATION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   METHOD OF DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX.
In the taxation of income which is subject to Village income taxes, if the
books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession both within
and without the boundaries of the Village disclose with reasonable accuracy
what portion of his net profit is attributable to that part of the business or
profession conducted within the boundaries of the Village, then only such
portion shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the Village for the
purpose of Municipal income taxation. The portion of the entire net profits of
a taxpayer to be allocated as having been derived from within the Village, in
the absence of actual records thereof, shall be determined as follows:
      (a)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the real
and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
      (b)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Village to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed.
      (c)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Village to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result.
   (B)   SALES MADE IN THE VILLAGE.
   As used in Section
171.05(c) "sales made in the village" means:
      (a)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village, regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the Village.
      (b)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village regardless of where title passes even though transported from a
point outside the Village if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (c)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Village to purchasers outside the Village regardless of where
title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
   (C)   TOTAL ALLOCATION.
   Add together the percentages determined in accordance with Section
171.05(a) to (c) or such of the aforesaid percentages as are applicable to the
particular taxpayer and divide the total so obtained by the number of
percentages used in deriving the total in order to obtain the business
allocation, percentage referred to in Section
171.05.
   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside the Village.
   (D)   RENTALS.
   Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the computation of
net profits from business activities under Section
171.03(c) to (e) only if and to the extent that the rental ownership,
management or operations of the real estate from which such rentals are
derived, whether so rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or
through agents or other representatives, constitute a business activity of the
taxpayer in whole or in part.
   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties, regardless of
number and value, aggregates in excess of one hundred twenty-five ($125.00) per
month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental, ownership, management
or operation of such properties is a business activity of such taxpayer, and
the net income of such rental property shall be subject to tax; provided that
in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered engaged in a
business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or fluctuating percentage
of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the lease, whether or not such
rental exceeds one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) per month; provided
further that in the case of farm property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when he shares in crops or when the rental is
based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from the farm
whether or not the gross income exceeds the one hundred twenty-five dollars
($125.00) per month; and provided further that the person who operates a
licensed rooming house shall be considered in business whether or not the gross
income exceeds one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) per month.
   (E)   OPERATING LOSS CARRY-FORWARD.
      (a)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to January 1, 1971, allocable to the Village may be applied against
the portion of the profit of succeeding tax years allocable to the Village
until exhausted but in no event for more than five taxable years immediately
following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating
loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
      (b)   The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the Village in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to
the Village
      (c)   The Administrator shall provide by rules and regulations the manner
in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
         (Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.014 STATEMENT OF PROCEDURAL HISTORY; STATE MANDATED CHANGES TO MUNICIPAL
INCOME TAX.
   (A)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to ORC 718 were enacted by Am
Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich
on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal corporations to conform to
and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have the authority to impose,
enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
   (B)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 2286-15,
effective January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends Chapter
171 in accordance with the provisions of ORC 718 to allow the Municipality to
continue the income tax and withholding tax administration and collection
efforts on behalf of the Municipality.
(Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.02 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   (A)   Ordinance 2286-15, effective January 1, 2016, and corresponding
changes to ORC 718, apply to municipal taxable years beginning on or after
January 1, 2016. All provisions of this Chapter
171 apply to taxable years beginning 2016 and succeeding taxable years.
   (B)   Ordinance 2286-15 does not repeal the existing sections of Chapter
171 for any taxable year prior to 2016, but rather amends Chapter
171 effective January 1, 2016. For municipal taxable years beginning before
January 1, 2016, the Municipality shall continue to administer, audit, and

withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.

failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to

   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting

the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.

   If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal

than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
171.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
171.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
171.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
      If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be

the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video

personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
171.03(23).
         (ii)   “Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:

         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would

      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise

customer, client, or patient.

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be

corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in

accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
171.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
171.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were

exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.

section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
171.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
171.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
171.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
171.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
171.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
171.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the

         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's

171.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be

      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, when a taxpayer who is a
non-resident of Burton, but who is domiciled in Geauga County or in any county
immediately contiguous to Geauga County is subject to the tax imposed by this
chapter and is also subject to a tax on the same income in the municipality his
residence, a credit of twenty-five percent of the tax due under this chapter or
twenty-five percent of the tax due under the ordinance of such other
municipality, whichever is the lesser, shall be allowed against the tax due
under this chapter, however, such credit shall not be allowed unless such other
municipality imposes on its residents a tax on the same income and reciprocal
provision is made in the ordinance of such other municipality granting to
nonresidents thereof of credit of not less than the percentage provided for
herein against the tax levied thereby and provided further that such reciprocal
credit shall not be allowed unless such nonresident is liable and has
acknowledged such liability in the municipality of his residence for any tax
due after such reciprocal credit is allowed, and the municipality of his
residence furnishes evidence of payment of tax therein or evidence of
assignment by the taxpayer of his claim for reciprocal credit to such other
municipality.
   The credit allowed under this section to a taxpayer who is a nonresident of
Burton but who I domiciled in Geauga County or in any county immediately
contiguous to Geauga County may be assigned to the municipality of his
residence and the amount of such credit paid to such other municipality in such
manner as the Administrator designated by the Village of Burton may prescribe.
   (B)   RESIDENT SUBJECT TO TAX IN OTHER MUNICIPALITY.
When the taxable income of a resident of the Village is subject to a municipal
income tax in another municipality on the same income taxable under this
chapter, such resident shall be allowed a credit in the amount of income tax
paid on such taxable income to such other municipality equal to fifty percent
(50%).

income taxable hereunder, or claim for or assignment of any refund due to the
credit provided for herein, must be filed with the Administrator on or before
December 31 of the year following that for which such credit is claimed,
provided that, in the case such claim for reciprocity refund has been assigned
to the municipality of residence, such municipality of residence shall file a
claim for refund with the Administrator of the Village of Burton on or before
January 31 following. Failure to file such claim for reciprocity credit or
refund, or assignment thereof, within the time prescribed herein shall render
such credit, claim for refund or assignment null and void.

described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
171.081 of this Chapter.

should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
171.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
171.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
171.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced

income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
171.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
171.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
171.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) or (c) of Section
171.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
171.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
171.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
      The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return. (Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
171.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
171.19 of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond
the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
171.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
              (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds
ten dollars.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
171.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
171.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,

Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers

of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document. (Ord.
2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.13 AUTHORITY AND POWERS OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
171.131 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS OF THE TAX
ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Tax Administrator has the authority to perform all duties and functions
necessary and appropriate to implement the provisions of this Chapter,
including without limitation:

by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths; provided that the powers
referred to in this division of this section shall be exercised by the Tax
Administrator only in connection with the performance of the duties
respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under a municipal corporation
income tax ordinance or resolution adopted in accordance with this chapter;
   (B)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax
Administrator's findings, and, if the Tax Administrator finds that there has
been an overpayment, approve and issue a refund payable to the taxpayer, the
taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as provided in this chapter;
   (E)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to the

pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator's own
motion, review, redetermine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax
Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,
determination, computation, assessment or order which the Tax Administrator has
made for which an appeal has been filed with the Local Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H) Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
   (I)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in Section
171.051 of this Chapter.
      (Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement. (Ord. 2286-15. Passed
11-23-15.)
171.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
171.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
171.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
171.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
171.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
171.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator. (Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23- 15.)
   
171.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
171.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality. Two members shall be
appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality, and may not be
employees, elected officials, or contractors with the Municipality at any time
during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of
appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top administrative official
of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but
may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax
Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in
municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to Section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
171.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
171.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
171.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
171.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the legislative
authority of the Municipality has the authority, by Ordinance or Resolution, to
adopt rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.
(Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.97 COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the
aforesaid period are fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the
collection of taxes or for the punishment of violations of this chapter have
been fully terminated, subject to the limitations contained in Section
171.19.
   (B)    Annual returns due for all or any part of the last effective year of
this chapter shall be due on the date provided in Section
171.091 as though the same were continuing.
(Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.98 SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this chapter.
(Ord. 2286-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
171.99 VIOLATIONS; PENALTY.
   (A)    Except as provided in division (B) of this section, whoever violates
Section
171.15 of this Chapter,, division (A) of Section
171.14 of this Chapter,, or Section

charge for the right or privilege of admission if the event giving rise to the
admissions charge is sponsored by a person or organization which has entered
into an agreement with the Village to provide compensation to the Village in
lieu of an admissions tax. Any person or organization conducting an event
within the Village which may give rise to an admissions tax may, but shall not
be required to, contract with the Village to pay the Village compensation in

of which is on file with the Clerk.
(Ord. 1726-92. Passed 8-17-92.)
172.03 ADMISSIONS TAX LEVIED.
   Regardless of where an Admission Charge to an event taking place within the
Village is imposed, there is hereby levied and imposed an Admissions Tax upon
every person who pays an Admission Charge to any place, event, or function
which takes place on property located within the Village. The Admissions Tax
imposed shall be twenty-five cents ($0.25) per person admitted.
(Ord. 1667-91. Passed 4-15-91.)
172.04 PLACE OF ADMISSION.
   (a)   Regardless of the existence of an admission gate or gates outside of
the municipal corporate boundaries of the Village of Burton, each person
conducting or sponsoring an event which takes place in whole or in part on
property located within the municipal boundaries and for which an admission
charge is levied shall maintain at least one "Place of Admission" on property
within the municipal boundaries.
   (b)   At such "Place of Admission", an accurate and complete count shall be
maintained of all individuals being admitted to any activity of the
aforementioned event located upon property within the municipal boundaries. All
such records shall be maintained in the form and manner prescribed by the
Administrator and shall be presented to the Administrator immediately following
the termination of each event or function. There shall be no necessity to
record at the "Place of Admission" the admission of those individuals who were
not required to pay an admission charge to the event, such as employees,
exhibitors, performers or others similarly-situated.
   (c)   The requirement of a "Place of Admission" may be waived by the
Administrator where the person conducting or sponsoring such event agrees to
maintain appropriate records of admission, and to collect the appropriate
Admissions Tax in some other fashion designed to consider the percentages of
the event's activities which are conducted within the Village. Any such
agreement shall be in writing, approved by Council and executed by the
appropriate parties.
(Ord. 1667-91. Passed 4-15-91.)
172.05 COLLECTION OF TAX; LIABILITY.
   (a)   Every person receiving any payment on which tax is levied under this
chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making such
payment. The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall be deemed to
be held in trust by the person required to collect the same until paid to the
Administrator as herein provided. Any person required to collect the tax
imposed under this chapter who fails to collect the same, or having collected
the same, fails to remit the same to the Administrator in the manner prescribed
by this chapter shall be liable to the Village for the amount of such tax, and
shall, unless the remittance be made as herein required, be guilty of a
violation of this chapter. However, no individual shall be personally liable
for the amount of such tax unless:
      (1)   He is personally sponsoring or conducting the event which gave rise
to the tax liability rather than as a member of a bona fide organization which
would otherwise protect that individual from personal liability, or
      (2)   He willfully and intentionally fails to collect or remit the tax as
described herein.
   (b)   The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the time the admission
charge is paid by the person seeking an admission to any place and shall be
reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the Administrator in
monthly installments and remittances therefor on or before the tenth day of the
month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in which the tax is
collected or received. Where an event occurs on consecutive days involving the
end of one month and the beginning of the next month, the time for filing shall
be extended to the tenth day of the month next succeeding such second month.
Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made by check, unless payment
or remittance is otherwise required by the Administrator but payment by check
shall not relieve the person collecting the tax from liability for payment and
remittance of the tax to the Administrator unless the check is honored and is
in the full and correct amount. The person receiving any payment for admissions
shall make out a return upon such forms and setting forth such information as
the Administrator may require, showing the amount of the tax upon admissions
for which he is liable for the preceding monthly period, and shall sign and
transmit the same to the Administrator with a remittance for such amount.
However, the Administrator may, in his discretion, require verified annual
returns from any person receiving admission payments setting forth such
additional information as he may deem necessary to determine correctly the
amount of tax collected and payable.
(Ord. 1678-91. Passed 8-19-91.)
172.06 ENTERTAINMENTS OF TEMPORARY NATURE; INTEREST ON DELINQUENT PAYMENT.
   (a)   Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition, entertainment or
amusement makes an admission charge which is subject to the tax herein levied,
and the same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Administrator
shall be the judge, the Administrator may require the report and remittance of
the admission tax immediately upon the collection of the same, at the
conclusion of the performance or exhibition, or at the conclusion of the series
of performances or exhibitions or at such other times as the Administrator
shall determine. Failure to comply with any requirement of the Administrator as
to report and remittance of the tax as required shall be a violation of this
chapter.
   (b)   The books, records and accounts of any person collecting a tax herein
levied shall as to admission charges and tax collections, be at all reasonable
times subject to examination and audit by the Administrator or his duly
authorized agent.
   (c)   If the tax imposed by this chapter is not paid when due there shall be
added, as part of the tax, interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month
from the time when the tax became due until paid.
(Ord. 1667-91. Passed 4-15-91.)
172.07 CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   Any person conducting or operating any place for entrance to which an
admission charge is made shall, on a form prescribed by the Administrator, make
application to and procure from the Administrator, a certificate of
registration, the fee for which shall be one dollar ($1.00). Such certificate
shall continue valid until December 31, of the year in which the same is
issued. Such certificate of registration, or duplicate original copies thereof
to be issued by the Administrator without additional charge, shall be displayed
in a conspicuous place in each ticket or box office where tickets of admission
are sold.
(Ord. 1667-91. Passed 4-15-91.)
172.08 CERTIFICATE FOR TEMPORARY SHOWS; JOINT LIABILITY.
   Whenever a certificate of registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owners, lessees or custodians of the
building, lots or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in this chapter by
such owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person receiving the
admission charge made in connection therewith. The applicant for a certificate
of registration for such purpose shall furnish with the application therefor
the name and address of the owner, lessee or custodian of the premises upon
which the amusement is to be conducted, and such owner, lessee or custodian
shall be notified by the Administrator of the issuance of such certificate and
the joint liability for collection and remittance of such tax.
(Ord. 1667-91. Passed 4-15-91.)
172.09 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Administrator shall have power to adopt rules and regulations not
inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out and enforcing the
payment, collection and remittance of the tax herein levied. A copy of such
rules and regulations shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation
in the Village at least once before they shall become effective and copies
shall be printed and made available in the office of the Administrator. Failure
or refusal to comply with any such rules and regulations shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 1667-91. Passed 4-15-91.)

   The tax herein levied and imposed shall be collected and paid on and after
the effective date of this chapter.

(Ord. 1667-91. Passed 4-15-91.)
172.13 APPEALS.
   Appeals from any ruling of the Administrator shall be made to Council, and
Council shall have authority to annul, modify or affirm any such ruling
appealed from, in conformity with the intent and purpose of this chapter.
(Ord. 1667-91. Passed 4-15-91.)
172.99 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.

excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
Section

taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
   partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
   Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
171.03  of the Codified Ordinances except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
171.01  to
171.99  of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal
income taxes and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
173.01  to
173.16  of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
171.03  (2) of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 2343-18. Passed 7-23-18.)
173.03 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the Village and that has made the election under Section
173.01  of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of Village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Chapter
171  of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the Village to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require,
that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Chapter
171  of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Chapter
171  of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the Village
as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the Village only if, regardless of where title passes, the
property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village from
a stock of goods located within the Village.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the Village from a location
outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the Village.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the Village in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the Village based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the Village to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under division 11 of Section
171.03  of the Codified Ordinances by the Village or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to the Village. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the Village any
amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay
tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Village under
this section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity. (Ord. 2343-18. Passed 7-23-18.)

judicial order, or as provided in Section 4123.271 or 5703.21 of the Revised
Code. The tax commissioner may furnish the internal revenue service with copies

173.01  to

information it receives in the performance of its administration of the
municipal net profits tax for taxpayers making the election provided in Section
173.01  of the Codified Ordinances The tax administrator shall review these
returns and information, as well as the information received pursuant to
divisions (B) and (C) of this section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer
for audit by the tax commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a form
prescribed by the commissioner and shall include any information that forms the
basis for the referral.
      (2)    If the tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the tax administrator under this section, the Village reserves its right to
pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the
correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
         (Ord. 2343-18. Passed 7-23-18.)
173.05 FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)    For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual

on a form and in the manner prescribed by the commissioner, on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable

      (2)    If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one
calendar year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to
compute the tax due under this chapter, in accordance with this Chapter and, if
applicable, Chapter
171  of the Codified Ordinances onto its annual return.
      (3)    The remittance shall be made payable to the treasurer of state and

         (b)    A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division

commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with this Chapter of the Codified
Ordinances the commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (E)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,

person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the

tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
(Ord. 2343-18. Passed 7-23-18.)
173.06 ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (A)    All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under Section
173.01  of the Codified Ordinances shall file any tax return or extension for
filing a tax return and shall make payment of amounts shown to be due on such
returns, electronically, either through the Ohio business gateway or in another
manner as prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)    A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the

173.07 CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.

Section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
173.01  of the Codified Ordinance a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (B)(1) or (2) of this section of the Codified Ordinance is binding
upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under Section
173.01  of the Codified Ordinance is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner

of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in this Chapter of the Codified
Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of this section of the
Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in this section of the Codified
Ordinances exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded,
the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in this section of the Codified
Ordinances include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included,
the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis
of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in this section of the Codified Ordinances exclude
the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the
computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
173.01  to
173.16  of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits
that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of
the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
173.03  of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit
from" appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of
corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
173.01  to
173.16  of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. 2343-18. Passed 7-23-18.)
173.08 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
173.01  of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
Sections
173.01  to
173.16  of the Codified Ordinances or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by Section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances whichever occurs first.

      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made

      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of Section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
Section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
173.01  to
173.16  of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with Section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 2343-18. Passed 7-23-18.)
173.10 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by Chapter
171  of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
173.01  to
173.16  of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
173.01  to
173.16  of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose
a penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
173.01  of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax
required to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty
equal to fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
173.01  to
173.16  of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of Sections
173.01  to
173.16  of the Codified Ordinances a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
173.01  to
173.16  of the Codified Ordinances a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances a penalty may be imposed not exceeding
the greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
Section
173.11  of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for
the assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
173.01  to
173.16  of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under Section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 2343-18. Passed 7-23-18.)
173.11 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under Section
173.01  to
173.16  of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Chapter
171  of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be no
bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by Sections
173.01  to
173.16  of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in Section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under Section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by Section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under Section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by Section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in Section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by this Chapter or Chapter
171  of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section. (Ord. 2343-18. Passed 7-23-18.)
173.12 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
173.01  to
173.16  of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of Section
173.11  of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in Section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with Section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under Section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by Section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 2343-18. Passed 7-23-18.)
173.13 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under Section
173.01  of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under this
Chapter of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances for
the purpose of assessing any additional tax due under this section, together
with any applicable penalty and interest. The amended return shall not reopen
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed
return no longer subject to assessment that are not affected, either directly
or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms
to the requirements of this Chapter. An application filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the
time prescribed in this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances. The application
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return.
(Ord. 2343-18. Passed 7-23-18.)
173.14 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
173.01  to
173.16  of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
173.01  to
173.16  of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 2343-18. Passed 7-23-18.)
173.15 CREDITS.
   (A)    A credit, granted by resolution or ordinance of the Village pursuant
to Chapter
171  or this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances, shall be available to a
taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
173.01  of the Codified Ordinances, against the municipal corporation's tax on
income. A municipal corporation shall submit the following information to the
tax commissioner on or before the later of January 31, 2018, or the thirty-
first day of January of the first year in which the taxpayer is eligible to
receive the credit:
      (1)    A copy of the agreement entered into by the Village and taxpayer
under Chapter
171  or this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances;
      (2)    A copy of the ordinance or resolution authorizing the agreement
entered into between the Village and the taxpayer.
   (B)   (1)    Each taxpayer that claims a credit shall submit, with the
taxpayer's tax return, documentation issued by the Village granting the credit
that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the credit, the amount of the
credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the tax year to which the credit
is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the Village and taxpayer under Chapter
171  or this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances, or to modify the terms or
conditions of any such existing agreement. (Ord. 2343-18. Passed 7-23-18.)
173.16 RECKLESS VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES.
   (A)    Except as provided in division (B) of this section, whoever
recklessly violates division (A) of Section
173.04  of the Codified Ordinances shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree and shall be subject to a fine of not more than one thousand
dollars or imprisonment for a term of up to six months, or both.
   (B)    Each instance of access or disclosure in violation of division (A) of
Section
173.04  of the Codified Ordinances constitutes a separate offense.
   (C)    These specific penalties shall not be construed to prevent the
Village from prosecuting any and all other offenses that may apply.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to

person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection

shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (4)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in

patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the

time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under

retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval
fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio
R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the
towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice required under
Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. However, the owner shall not do either
of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in addition
to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and

guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars

resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section

(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
 313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,
or a combination of them.
            2.   The person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or
urine contains at least the concentration of alcohol specified in subsection
(a)(1)B., C., D. or E. hereof.
            3.   Except as provided in subsection (d)(3) of this section, the
person has a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the concentration specified in
subsection (a)(1)J. hereof.
         B.   No person under twenty-one years of age shall be in physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or
a combination of them or while the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine contains at least the concentration of alcohol specified in
subsection (b)(1) to (4) hereof.
      (3)   Subsection (d)(2)A.3. of this section does not apply to a person
who is in physical control of a vehicle while the person has a concentration of
a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or
exceeds the amount specified in subsection (a)(1)J. hereof, if both of the
following apply:
         A.   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
         B.   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.
            (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).

commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. (ORC 4511.19)

felony of the third degree and shall be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
subsection (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver’s or occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section as a result of the conviction or guilty
plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in division (F)(2) of Ohio R.C.
4511.191.
      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may
sentence the offender to five consecutive days in jail and not less than
eighteen consecutive days of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into

Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s

restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other

      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is

network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio  R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is

aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. (ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 JURISDICTION OUTSIDE VILLAGE LIMITS.
   (a)   The Police Department of the Village is hereby granted jurisdiction to
enforce all existing provisions, rules and regulations of the Codified
Ordinances of the Village where necessary, in order to properly protect any and
all lands, buildings and structures owned or used by the Village which are

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 Type of Misdemeanor                         Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

                                              1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the

excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the

      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

purpose;

activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)

or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that
is not an occupied structure;
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
(ORC 2909.03)

      (1)   Knowingly, by any means;
      (2)   Recklessly, by means of fire, explosion, flood, poison gas, poison,
radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or
endangering, a misdemeanor of the second degree. If violation of this section
creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an
aircraft and if the violation creates a risk of physical harm to any person or

545.08, 
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
 545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
 
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

R.C. 4503.22, a temporary motor vehicle license registration as prescribed by
Ohio R.C. 4503.182, or any comparable temporary motor vehicle license
registration as prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United

specially damaged by such violation, in addition to other remedies provided by
law, may institute injunction, mandamus, abatement or any other appropriate
action, actions, proceeding or proceedings to prevent, enjoin, abate or remove
such unlawful location, erection, construction, reconstruction, enlargement,
change, maintenance or use.
(Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
1113.08 REVOCATION OF ZONING PERMIT.
   (a)    In the event the Zoning Inspector determines within one year of
issuance that a zoning permit or certificate was erroneously issued based upon
either misrepresentation by the applicant (whether willful or unintentional),
mistake of fact, or mistake of law, then the Zoning Inspector may seek
revocation of such zoning permit.
   (b)    Such revocation shall be accomplished by notice in writing to the
owner stating the following:
      (1)   The error alleged to have occurred in the issuance of the permit.
      (2)    The zoning violation which arises from such error.
      (3)    The remedies, if any, the owner must follow in order to eliminate
the violation.
      (4)    Recitation of the owner’s right to appeal as set forth herein.
   (c)    Such notice shall be either hand-delivered to the owner or sent to
him at his last known address by certified mail, return receipt requested.
   (d)    If, within thirty days of receipt of the notice, the owner makes a
written request to the Zoning Board of Appeals for an appeal of the Zoning
Inspector's decision, such owner shall be entitled to a public hearing before
the Zoning Board of Appeals which shall thereafter determine, by majority vote,
whether or not the owner's zoning certificate should be revoked. Notice of the
public hearing shall be issued in the same manner as notice for a variance
request under this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (e)    In making its decision, the Zoning Board may permit the nonconforming
use to continue only upon the owner complying with certain conditions.
   (f)    Factors which shall be considered by the Zoning Board in reaching its
decision include:
      (1)   The extent to which the owner has acted in reliance upon the
previously issued permit.
      (2)    The extent to which the owner or Village officers are at fault in
the issuance of the permit.
      (3)    The impact the nonconforming use may have upon surrounding
properties if permitted to continue.
      (4)    The cost and burden on the owner of any corrective measures.
      (5)    The impact the continuation of the nonconforming use would have
upon public health, safety, and welfare and upon the spirit and intent of the
Zoning Code.
   (g)    In the event the owner fails to request a hearing before the Zoning
Board of Appeals within the time limit permitted in this section, then the
Zoning Inspector may issue an order revoking such zoning certificate which
shall be enforceable in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 1696-91. Passed 11-25-91.)
1113.99 PENALTY.
   No person shall locate, erect, construct, reconstruct, enlarge, change,
maintain or use any building or land in violation of any regulation in or any
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance or any amendment or supplement thereto
adopted by Council. Any person, firm or corporation violating any regulation in
or any provision of the Zoning Ordinance or any amendment or supplement thereto
shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be
fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per offense. Each and
everyday, after notification, during which such illegal location, erection,
construction, reconstruction, enlargement, change, maintenance or use continues
shall be deemed a separate offense. If construction has begun before the
issuance of a permit, the fee is double. (Ord. 2178-09. Passed 2-23-09.)

1117.01 MEMBERSHIP; ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Appointment. There is hereby established a Board of Zoning Appeals
which shall consist of five electors appointed by the Mayor, subject to
confirmation by Council. Vacancies shall be filled by the same procedure. The
five electors first appointed shall serve for terms of one, two, three, four
and five years respectively; thereafter appointments shall be for five year
terms, beginning January 1. Each member shall serve until his successor is
appointed and qualified. Members of the Board shall be removable for
nonperformance of duty, misconduct in office or other cause, by Council, upon
written charges having been filed with the Clerk of Council and after a public
hearing has been held regarding such charges, a copy of the charges having been
served upon the member so charged at least ten days prior to the hearing,
either personally or by registered mail or by leaving the same at his usual
place of residence. The member shall be given an opportunity to be heard and
answer such charges.
   (b)   Organization and Procedure. The Board shall organize annually to elect
a Chairman, a Vice-Chairman and Secretary. It shall further adopt rules for its
own government not inconsistent with law or with any other ordinances of the
Municipality to hear appeals on any variance or hardship created by the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
      (1)   Meetings. Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the
Chairman and at such other times as the Board may determine. The Chairman or in
his absence, the Vice-Chairman may administer oaths and the Board may compel
the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the Board shall be open to the
public. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of
each member upon each question, or if absence or failing to vote, indicating
such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official
actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the Clerk and
shall be a public record.
      (2)   Quorum. Three members of the Board shall constitute a quorum. The
Board shall act by resolution and the concurring vote of three members of the
Board shall be necessary to reverse any order or determination of the Zoning
Inspector or to decide in favor of an applicant any matter of which the Board
has original jurisdiction under the Zoning Ordinance or to grant any variance
from the requirements stipulated in the Zoning Ordinance.
      (3)   Department assistance. The Board may call upon the various
departments of the Municipality for assistance in the performance of its
duties, and it shall be the duty of such departments to render such assistance
to the Board as may reasonably be required.
         (Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
1117.02 APPLICATIONS AND APPEALS.
   (a)   Applications. An application, in cases in which the Board of Zoning
Appeals has original jurisdiction under the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance,
may be taken by any person aggrieved including a tenant or a governmental
officer, department, board or bureau. Such application shall be filed with the
Zoning Inspector, who shall transmit the same to the Board. The fee for any
action presented to the Board of Zoning Appeals for determination shall be
sixty- five dollars ($65.00), all of which shall be paid to the General Fund of
the Village. An additional advance deposit of five hundred dollars ($500.00) is
required for expenses related to the appeal or application, including any fees
associated with the review of the appeal or application by the Solicitor,
Engineer or other professional retained by the Village. Any portion of a
deposit not expended for advertising, administrative costs or fees for the
Solicitor, Engineer or other professional retained by the Village, shall be
refunded to the applicant within thirty days of the final order of the Board.
The fee shall be paid to the Zoning Inspector at the time an application or
appeal is filed, in which event, the Zoning Inspector shall forthwith pay over
to the Clerk- Treasurer, to the credit of the General Revenue Fund, all of such
fee. In the event the Village determines funds in excess of the five hundred
dollar deposit are necessary for the proper review of the appeal or
application, the Clerk-Treasurer shall notify the Applicant in writing that the
Applicant must deposit such additional funds with the Village. If such funds
are not deposited within seven working days thereafter, the appeal will be
stayed and not heard until such funds are deposited by the Applicant with the
Village. No grant of a variance or a conditional use permit or any other grant
of relief by the Board of Zoning Appeals is effective until all actual costs of
the appeal are reimbursed by the Applicant to the Village. The application
presented to the Board shall also be accompanied by a list of the last known
names and addresses of the owners of all property within and contiguous to and
directly across the street from any parcel or parcels which is the subject of
review by the Board, as shown upon the tax maps for Geauga County.
(Ord. 1998-00. Passed 10-16-00.)
   (b)   Appeals.
      (1)   An appeal to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved or by
any officer of the Municipality affected by any decision of the Zoning
Inspector. Such appeal shall be taken within twenty days after the decision by
filing with the Zoning Inspector and with the Board a notice of appeal
specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning Inspector shall forthwith transmit
to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from was taken.
      (2)    An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from unless the Zoning Inspector shall certify to the Board after the
notice of appeal has been filed with it that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order which may be granted by a court of equity after notice to the
officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
      (3)    The Board may, in conformity with the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination appealed from and shall make such order,
requirement, decision or determination as in its opinion ought to be made in
the premises; and to that end, shall have all powers of the Zoning Inspector
from whom the appeal is taken.
         (Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
1117.03 HEARINGS.
   (a)    The Board of Zoning Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the
hearing of an appeal, shall give public notice in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Municipality at least ten days prior to the hearing and
written notice of the hearing and the stated purpose of the hearing shall be
mailed by first class mail to the owners of property within and contiguous to
and directly across the street from such parcel or parcels which will be the
subject of the hearing as prescribed in Section
1117.02 at least ten days prior to the hearing. At this hearing any party may
appear in person or by attorney.
(Ord. 1251-82. Passed 2-15-82.)
   (b)    The hearings of the Board shall be public. The Board may go into
executive session for discussion as permitted pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code
and the Village ordinances. (Ord. 1627-90. Passed 10-15-90.)
   (c)    Upon the day for hearing any application or appeal the Board may
adjourn the hearing in order to permit the obtaining of additional information
or to cause such further notice as it deems proper to be served upon such other
property owners as it decides may be substantially interested in the
application or appeal. In the case of an adjourned hearing, persons previously
notified and persons already heard need not be notified of the time of
resumption of the hearing unless the Board so decides.
(Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
1117.04 DECISIONS OF THE BOARD.
   (a)    The Board of Zoning Appeals shall decide all applications and appeals
within thirty days after the final hearing thereon.
   (b)    A certified copy of the Board's decision shall be transmitted to all
parties in interest. Such decision shall be binding upon the Zoning Inspector
and observed by him, and he shall incorporate the terms and conditions of the
same in the permit to the applicant or appellant, whenever a permit is
authorized by the Board.
   (c)    A decision of the Board shall not become final until the expiration
of ten days from the date such decision is made unless the Board finds the
immediate taking effect of such decision is necessary for the preservation of
property or personal rights and shall so certify on the record. (Ord. 914.
Passed 11-8-66.)
1117.05 APPEALS TO COMMON PLEAS COURT.
   Any person, firm or corporation, or any officer, department, board or agency
of the Municipality, or any interested elector of the Municipality who has been
aggrieved or affected by any decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals may appeal
from such decision to the Geauga County Common Pleas Court by filing notice of
intent to appeal within ten days and filing a petition with the Clerk of Court
within twenty days from the date of the decision and setting forth the facts of
the case.
(Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
1117.06 POWERS OF THE BOARD.
   (a)    Exceptions and Interpretations. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
have the power to hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance, applications filed as hereinbefore provided for special
exceptions or for interpretation of the District Map, or for decisions upon
other special questions on which the Board is authorized by the Zoning
Ordinance to pass. In considering an application for a special exception or
interpretation of the District Map the Board shall give due regard to the
nature and condition of all adjacent uses and structures; and in authorizing a
special exception the Board may impose such requirements and conditions with
respect to location, construction, maintenance and operation, in addition to
those expressly stipulated in the Zoning Ordinance for the particular special
exception or as the Board may deem necessary for the protection of adjacent
properties and the public interest.
   (b)    Administrative Review and Variances.
      (1)    The Board shall have the power to hear and decide appeals, filed
as hereinbefore provided, where it is alleged by the appellant that there is
error in any order, requirement, decision, grant or refusal made by the Zoning
Inspector or other official in the interpretation of the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance.
         (Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
      (2)    A.    The Board shall have the power to authorize upon appeal in
specific cases, filed as hereinbefore provided, such variances from the
provisions or requirements of the Zoning Code as will not be contrary to the
public interest. Where the appellant seeks a variance pertaining to the use of
property, no variance may be granted unless, owing to special conditions
pertaining to the property at issue, the literal enforcement of the provisions
or requirements of the Zoning Ordinance would cause undue and unnecessary
hardship.
         B.    Where the appellant seeks a variance pertaining to an area
requirement otherwise applicable to the property, no variance may be granted
unless the appellant has demonstrated the literal enforcement of the provisions
or requirements of the Zoning Ordinance pertaining to area requirements would
cause the appellant practical difficulties.
   The factors to be considered and weighed in determining whether an appellant
seeking an area variance has encountered practical difficulties in the proposed
use of his property include, but are not limited to:
            1.    Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable
return or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
            2.    Whether the variance is substantial;
            3.    Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
            4.    Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g., water, sewer, garbage);
            5.    Whether the appellant purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restrictions;
            6.    Whether the appellant's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
            7.    Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement
would be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
      (3)    Where the Board has determined that literal enforcement of the
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance would involve practical difficulties or
would cause undue hardship, unnecessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of
the Zoning Ordinance, the Board shall have power to authorize a variance from
such strict application so as to relieve such hardship or difficulties so that
the spirit and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance shall be observed and
substantial justice done. In authorizing a variance the Board may attach
thereto such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of
the proposed structure or use as it deems necessary in the interest of the
furtherance of the purpose of the Zoning Ordinance and in the public interest.
In authorizing a variance with attached condition, the Board shall require such
evidence and guaranty or bond as it may deem to be necessary to ensure that the
conditions attached are being and will be complied with.
      (4)    No such variance in the provisions or requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance shall be authorized by the Board unless the Board finds that the
authorizing of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent
property and will not materially impair the purposes of the Zoning Ordinance or
the public interest.
         (Ord. 1632-90. Passed 10-15-90.)
      (5)    No grant of a variance shall be authorized unless the Board
specifically finds that the condition or situation of the specific piece of
property or the intended use of the property for which variance is sought, one
or the other in combination, is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to
make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation for such
conditions or situation.
      (6)    In exercising its power the Board may, in conformity with the
provisions of State statutes and the Zoning Ordinance, reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all powers of the
office from whom the appeal is taken.
   (c)    Performance Requirements Procedure. The Board shall have the power to
authorize, upon application in specific cases filed as hereinafter provided,
issuance of a zoning certificate for uses that are subject to performance
requirements procedure under Chapter
1161 ss provided in the following:
      (1)   Application. An application for a zoning certificate for a use
subject to performance requirements shall be submitted in duplicate on a form
prescribed by the Board. The applicant shall also submit in duplicate a plan of
the proposed construction or development, including a description of the
proposed machinery, processes and products and specifications for the
mechanisms and techniques to be used in restricting the emission of dangerous
and objectionable elements as set forth in Chapter
1161 in accordance with rules prescribed by the Board specifying the type of
information required in such plans and specifications. The fee for such
application shall include the cost of the special reports that may be required
to process it, as set forth in subsection (c)(2) hereof.
      (2)    Report by expert consultants. If in its opinion the proposed use
may cause the emission of dangerous or objectionable elements the Board may
refer the application to one or more expert consultants qualified to advise as
to whether a proposed use will conform to the applicable performance standards
specified in Chapter
1161 for investigation and report. Such consultant or consultants shall report
as promptly as possible after his or their receipt of such application. A copy
of such report shall be promptly furnished to the applicant.
      (3)    Review by Board. Within thirty days after the Board has received
the aforesaid application or the aforesaid report, if a report was required, or
within such further period as agreed to by the applicant, the Board shall
decide whether the proposed use will conform to the applicable performance
standards, and on such basis shall authorize or refuse to authorize issuance of
a zoning certificate or require a modification of the proposed plan of
construction or specifications, proposed equipment or operation. Any zoning
certificate so authorized and issued shall be conditioned upon, among other
things:
         A.    The applicant's completed buildings and installations conforming
in operation to the applicable performance standards; and
         B.    The applicant paying the fees for services of the expert
consultant or consultants deemed reasonable and necessary by the Board to
advise the Board as to whether or not the applicant's completed buildings and
installation in operation will meet the applicable performance standards.
      (4)    Continued enforcement. The Zoning Inspector shall investigate any
purported violation of performance standards, and if there is reasonable ground
for the same, shall notify the Board of the occurrence or existence of a
probable violation thereof. The Board shall investigate the alleged violation
and for such investigation shall employ qualified experts. If, after public
hearing on due notice, the Board finds that a violation occurred or exists, a
copy of the findings shall be forwarded to Council. The services of any
qualified experts, employed by the Board to advise in establishing a violation,
shall be paid by the violator if the violation is established, otherwise, by
the Municipality.
         (Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
1117.07 TIME PERIOD FOR COMMENCEMENT WHEN VARIANCE GRANTED.
    Whenever a variance is granted under the provisions of this Chapter
1117, such variance shall be null and void if the construction, alteration,
erection, use or other purpose for which such variance was granted is not
commenced within one year from the date of the Board of Zoning Appeals meeting
at which such variance was granted.
(Ord. 1629-90. Passed 10-15-90.)

hearing shall be mailed by the Clerk- Treasurer, by first class mail, at least
twenty days before the date of the public hearing to the owners of property
within and contiguous and directly across the street from such parcel or
parcels, to the addresses of such owners appearing on the County Auditor's tax
list of the Treasurer's mailing list and to such other list or lists that may
be specified by Council from time to time. The failure of delivery of such
notice shall not invalidate any such amendment.
(Ord. 1251-82. Passed 2-15-82.)
   (c)    The published and mailed notification shall set forth the time and
place of the public hearing and a summary of the proposed amendment. During the
thirty days' advertising period the text or copy of the text of such ordinance
or amendment and the maps, plans and reports submitted by the Commission shall
be on file for public examination in the office of the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (d)    After the public hearing Council may adopt the proposal as
recommended by the Commission by majority vote of its entire membership. If
Council modifies the proposal, it shall resubmit the proposed modification to
the Commission for further consideration and approval. Council may adopt the
modified proposal without the approval of the Commission by a three- fourths
vote of the full membership of Council. The Clerk-Treasurer shall submit a copy
of any action in regard to the Zoning Ordinance to the Commission. (Ord. 914.
Passed 11-8-66.)
1121.05 DEPOSIT; REFUNDS.
   (a)    At the time that an application for an amendment to the Zoning
Ordinance is filed with the Planning Commission by the owner of property
involved or any other person having an interest in the premises affected, as
provided in Section
1121.02, there shall be deposited with the Clerk-Treasurer the sum of one
thousand dollars ($1,000) for the cost of review by the Commission, for the
cost of expert consultation, engineering review by the Engineer, legal expenses
for the review of all proposed ordinances, plans, attendance at public
meetings, for the cost of all legal notices and other administrative expenses
incidental to the determination of such application for a change in the zoning
amendment. At any time that the actual cost incurred in reviewing such
application for a change in zoning prior to action by the Commission is two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) less than the amount on deposit, the Commission
or Council, after action taken by the Commission, may require the applicant to
submit an additional cash bond of five hundred dollars ($500.00).
   (b)    In the event that the actual cost incurred for review is less than
the amount on deposit, the unused portion of the cash bond shall be refunded
after final action by Council or by final action of the Commission if it
disapproves the application and the petitioner elects not to have the
application certified to Council.
   (c)    In the event the actual cost is greater than the cash bond on deposit
the petitioner shall be billed for such additional costs and such additional
costs shall be paid before final action is taken by the Commission and/or
Council.

classified as a Historic District. Property within the Historic District is
subject to the provisions of Chapter
159 of the Village’s Codified Ordinances in addition to the regulations in this
Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2253-13. Passed 3-25-13.)
1131.02 DISTRICT MAP.
   The boundaries of the districts are shown upon the Official District Map
which is made a part of the Zoning Ordinance. The District Map and all the
notations, references and other information shown thereon are a part of the
Zoning Ordinance and have the same force and effect as if the District Map and
all the notations, references and other information shown thereon were all
fully set forth or described therein. The original District Map is properly
attested and on file with the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (a)    No amendment to the Zoning Ordinance which involves matter portrayed
on the Official District Map shall become effective until after such change and
entry has been made on the Map. The Mayor is responsible for delegating a
councilman and/or the Engineer to keep the Map up-to-date.
   (b)    No changes of any nature shall be made in the Official District Map
or matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in
the Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)    Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the Official
District Map which may from time to time be made or published, the Map, which
shall be located in the office of the Clerk-Treasurer shall be the final
authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas, buildings
and other structures.
   (d)    In the event that the Official District Map becomes damaged,
destroyed or lost, Council may, by resolution, adopt a new Map which shall
supersede the prior Map. The new Map may correct drafting or other errors or
omissions in the prior Map, but no such corrections shall have the effect of
amending the original Zoning Ordinance or subsequent amendments thereof.
      (Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
1131.03 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   (a)    The district boundary lines on the District Map are intended to
follow either streets or service street or lot lines; and where the districts
designated on the Map are bounded approximately by such street, alley or lot
lines, the street or service street or lot shall be construed to be the
boundary of the district, unless such boundary is otherwise indicated by
dimensions noted on the Map. In the case of unsubdivided property, the district
boundary lines shall be determined by dimensions appearing on the Zoning
District Map.
   (b)    Whenever any street, service street, or other public way is vacated
by official action of Council, the zoning district adjoining each side of such
street, service street or public way shall be automatically extended to the
center of such vacation and all area included in the vacation shall then and
henceforth by subject to all appropriate regulations of the extended districts.
(Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
1131.04 COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS.
   The regulations set by the Zoning Ordinance within each district shall be
minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of
structure or land, and particularly, except as hereinafter provided:
   (a)    No building, structure or land shall hereafter be used or occupied
and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered unless in conformity
with all of the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is
located.
   (b)    No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or altered:
      (1)    To exceed the height requirements;
      (2)    To accommodate or house a greater number of families;
      (3)    To occupy a greater percentage of lot area; or
      (4)    To have narrower or smaller rear yards, front yards, side yards or
other open spaces;
than herein required; or in any other manner contrary to the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)    No part of a yard or other open space, or off-street parking or
loading space required about or in connection with any building for the purpose
of complying with the Zoning Ordinance, shall be included as part of a yard,
open space or off- street parking or loading space similarly required for any
other building.
   (d)    No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of the Zoning
Ordinance shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements
set forth herein. Yards or lots created after the effective date of the Zoning
Ordinance shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by the
Zoning Ordinance.
      (Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
1131.05 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)    Any lawful use of any dwelling, building, structure or land existing
at the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance may be continued, even though
such use does not conform to the provisions hereof. A nonconforming use of a
building may only be changed to a conforming use. Whenever a nonconforming use
has been changed to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed
again to a nonconforming use. The nonconforming use of a building may be
extended throughout those parts thereof which were manifestly arranged or
designed for such use at the time of adoption of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)    Whenever the use of a building or land becomes nonconforming through
a change in the Zoning Ordinance or in the district boundaries, such use may be
continued.
(Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
   (c)    A nonconforming use of a building or land or portions thereof which
are hereafter voluntarily discontinued for a continuous period of one year or
more shall not again be used except in conformity with the regulations of the
district in which such building or land is located.
(Ord. 1694-91. Passed 11-25-91.)
   (d)    Any building arranged, intended or designed for a nonconforming use,
the construction of which has been started at the time of the passage of the
Zoning Ordinance, but not completed, may be completed and put into such
nonconforming use, provided it is done within one year after the Zoning
Ordinance takes effect.
   (e)    A nonconforming building which has been damaged by fire, explosion,
act of God or the public enemy to the extent of more than sixty percent (60%)
of its reproduction value at the time of damage, as determined by the Building
Inspector, shall not be restored except in conformity with the regulations of
the district in which it is located. When damaged by less than sixty percent
(60%) of its reproduction value, a nonconforming building may be repaired or
reconstructed and used as before the time of the damage, provided such repairs
or reconstruction are completed within one year of the date of such damage.
   (f)    The floor area of a building or structure or any land area devoted to
a lawful nonconforming use at the time the Zoning Ordinance takes effect may
not be altered or enlarged so as to extend the nonconforming use a total of
more than ten percent (10%) of the floor area or land area in nonconforming use
at the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (g)    Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance
and repair of a building or structure containing a nonconforming use.
Structural alterations may be made to a building or structure containing a
nonconforming use as follows:
      (1)    When required by law.
      (2)    Pursuant to the provisions of subsection (f) hereof.
      (3)    To convert to a conforming use.
   (h)    Nonconforming trailers or mobile homes located on a lot in any
district once removed shall not be relocated on such lot and shall not be
replaced with another trailer or mobile home. (Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
1131.06 TRAFFIC VISIBILITY ACROSS CORNER LOTS.
   In any district on any corner lot, no fence, structure or planting shall be
erected or maintained within twenty feet of the "corner" of intersecting right-
of-way lines at the height of more than three feet above curb or street grade
or so as to interfere with traffic visibility across the corner.
(Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
1131.07 PENDING APPLICATION FOR BUILDING PERMITS.
   Nothing contained in this chapter shall require any change in the overall
layout, plans, construction, size or designated use of any development,
building, structure or part thereof, for which official approval and required
building permits have been granted before the enactment of the Zoning
Ordinance, the construction of which, conforming with such plans, shall have
been started prior to the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance and completion
thereof carried on in a normal manner within the subsequent one year period and
not discontinued until completion, except for reasons beyond the builder's
control.
(Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)

(Ord. 1251-82. Passed 2-15-82.)
1135.02 COMPLIANCE WITH SCHEDULE REQUIRED.
   Buildings and land shall be used and buildings shall be designed, erected,
altered, moved or maintained, in whole or in part in all zoning districts only
for the uses set forth in the schedule in Section
1135.03 and the following regulations:
   (a)    The main buildings and uses set forth as permitted uses in Section

      (1)    Theaters, bowling alleys, dance halls, nightclubs or cafes and up
to one hundred percent (100%) of the parking spaces required for a church or
school auditorium may be provided and used jointly by
      (2)    Banks, offices, retail stores, repair shops, service
establishments and similar uses not normally open, used or operated during the
same hours as those listed in subsection (b)(1) hereof, provided, however, that
written agreement thereto is properly executed and filed as specified in
subsection (c) hereof.
   (c)    In any case where the required parking spaces are not located on the
same lot with the building or use served, or where such spaces are collectively
or jointly provided and used, a written agreement thereby assuring their
retention for such purposes shall be properly drawn and executed by the parties
concerned, approved as to form by the Solicitor and executed by Council and
shall be filed with the application for a building permit.
(Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
1143.04 DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF PARKING AREAS.
   Every parcel of land hereafter used as a public, commercial or private
parking area shall be developed and maintained in accordance with the following
requirements:
   (a)    Screening and Landscaping. Off-street parking areas for more than
five vehicles shall be effectively screened on each side which adjoins or faces
premises situated in any "R" District or institutional premises, by a masonry
wall or solid fence. Such wall or fence shall be not less than four feet or
more than six feet in height and shall be maintained in good condition without
any advertising thereon. The space between such wall or fence and the lot line
of the adjoining premises in any "R" District shall be landscaped with grass,
hardy shrubs or evergreen ground cover and maintained in good condition. In
lieu of such wall or fence, a strip of land not less than fifteen feet in width
and planted and maintained with an evergreen hedge or dense planting of
evergreen shrubs not less than four feet in height may be substituted.
   (b)    Minimum Distance and Setbacks. No part of any parking area for more
than five vehicles shall be closer than ten feet to any dwelling, school,
hospital or other institution for human care located on an adjoining lot,
unless screened by an unpierced masonry wall. If on the same lot with a main
building the parking area shall not be located within the front yard or side
street yard required for such building. In no case shall any part of a parking
area be closer than five feet to any established street right of way. The wall
or hedge required in subsection (a) hereof shall be set back from each street
the same as if it were a building wall, so as to observe the front yard and
side street yard requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)    Surfacing. Any off-street parking area for more than five vehicles
shall be graded for proper drainage and surfaced with an asphaltic or Portland
cement binder pavement so as to provide a durable and dustless surface and
shall be so arranged and marked as to provide for orderly and safe parking and
storage of self-propelled vehicles. The foregoing surfacing requirements shall
not apply to a parking area in an "M" District if more than 200 feet distant
from any "R" District, except that a dustless surface shall be provided in any
case.
   (d)    Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking area
shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from adjoining premises in
any "R" District and shall be so arranged as to not interfere with traffic on
any adjoining street.

1151.01 REQUIREMENTS; APPLICATION.
   (a)    Conditional use permits shall be required for certain types of main
uses, so classified because of their uncommon or unique characteristics,
infrequency of occurrence, large area requirements or for other reasons; and
such use shall not be permitted by right. The conditional uses enumerated
throughout the Zoning Ordinance may, however, be permitted under specific
conditions in the district enumerated or they may be prohibited by the Board of
Zoning Appeals after making a determination for conformance with the following
procedures and standards.
   (b)    Application for conditional use permits shall be made by the owner,
lessee or developer of property and shall consist of such plans and/or drawings
and/or a statement as necessary to fully describe all elements of the proposed
use. Such data supplied with the permit application shall describe in detail
the proposed use to the extent that the Board can have no doubt as to the
development of the proposed use and can determine the effect upon surrounding
properties, and further can evaluate the effect upon traffic, fire hazards,
public utilities and the public health, safety and welfare. Application for
such permits shall be made to the Board and it shall hold a public hearing
thereon, notice of which shall be mailed to the property owners within 200 feet
for the proposed use and further, notice of aforesaid public hearing shall be
published in a newspaper of general circulation in the Municipality at least
fifteen days prior to the hearing. (Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
1151.02 STANDARDS FOR EVALUATING CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   An application for a conditional use permit shall not be approved unless the
Board of Zoning Appeals finds that it complies with the following conditions
and standards.
   (a)    To be approved in a residential district, it shall be found that:
      (1)   The proposed use would be properly located in relation to any
adopted land use and street plan, particularly in proper relation to the
secondary and local street and pedestrian circulation pattern;
      (2)   The proposed use would generate an amount of traffic through a
residential neighborhood which would not constitute a danger or nuisance to the
residents if located along a local street;
      (3)   The proposed use is necessary to serve the surrounding residential
areas, which neighborhood cannot be served satisfactorily if the same use is
located in a nearby less restrictive district where it may be permitted by
right; and
      (4)   The location, design and operation of such use would not discourage
or interfere with the appropriate development or impair the value of the
surrounding residential district.
   (b)   To be approved in a business, industrial or S-1 special district, it
shall be found that:
      (1)   The proposed use is necessary to serve community needs, and
existing similar facilities located in a less restrictive or more remote
district in which the use may be permitted by right is inadequate;
      (2)   The proposed use would not be closer than that which would
constitute a danger or nuisance to schools, churches and other places of
assembly;
      (3)   The location, size, intensity and layout of the proposed use and
operation would conform to the noise, smoke, dust, odors, fumes, vibrations
and/or glare performance standards of the districts;
      (4)   The proposed use will form a harmonious part of the business or
industrial district, considering such features as convenience of access and
relationship of one use to another;
      (5)   Because of its limited size, modern processes or equipment the
performance of the proposed use is such that it should properly be permitted in
a less restrictive district than the district in which it is permitted by
right;
         (Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66; Ord. 1905-97. Passed 6-23-97.)
      (6)   The hours of operation of the proposed use are similar to a use
permitted in the district and that the proposed use will not generate more
traffic than may be safely accommodated in the area;
      (7)   That the Village’s public utilities and streets shall be capable of
accommodating such proposed use within current or reasonably anticipated
capacities and shall not be adversely affected by such proposed use. The Zoning
Board of Appeals shall seek input from the appropriate Village governmental
bodies regarding such utilities and/or streets;
      (8)   The proposed use has obtained any necessary licenses, permits or
other similar required approvals for operation from all necessary governmental
bodies. (Ord. 1794-94. Passed 2-21-94.)
   (c)    To be approved in any residential zoning district, the proposed
conditional use shall conform to the most restrictive height, lot area, front
yard (minimum depth), side yard, rear yard (minimum depth), lot frontage, and,
if applicable, minimum lot area per family, and minimum residential floor area
per family requirements, all as set forth in Section
1139.02 of the Planning and Zoning Code.
   To be approved in any business or industrial district, or special use
district, a proposed conditional use shall conform to all height, front yard
(minimum depth), side yard, rear yard (minimum depth), maximum percentage of
lot coverage, the minimum district area, minimum lot area, and minimum lot
coverage requirements as set forth in Sections
1139.03 and
1139.04, respectively, of the Planning and Zoning Code.
   (d)    For any category of height, lot area, or floor area requirements set
forth in either Section
1139.02 or
1139.03 of this Zoning Code, where a particular minimum requirement of any such
categories would not apply to the proposed conditional use (e.g., minimum lot
area per family for a proposed conditional use which would not involve a family
or families, as defined in this Code), the Board is empowered to establish
reasonable minimum requirements for such proposed conditional use based upon:
      (1)    The existing comparable Regulations for the applicable zoning
district as set forth in Chapter
1139.
      (2)    The character of the surrounding neighborhood and prevalent
standards therein.
      (3)    The nature of the proposed use and the severity of the impact of
such minimum requirements upon such proposed use.
         (Ord. 1657-91. Passed 2-18-91.)
   (e)   In addition to the provisions of subsection (b) hereof, Computerized
Internet Sweepstakes Café shall be subject to the following additional
conditions:
      (1)   The Board shall consider the impact that the use will have on the
adjacent properties, such as lighting, noise, signs, traffic and parking.
      (2)   All activities associated with the use shall be conducted in an
enclosed building.
      (3)   The area of the premises upon which the Computerized Internet
Sweepstakes Café is operated shall comply with the Codified Ordinances of the
Village of Burton's regulations of computerized internet sweepstakes cafes.
      (4)   All computerized sweepstakes devices on the premises shall be
identified in the application by manufacturer and serial number and listed in
the approved zoning certificate.
      (5)   A.   The premises shall be located more than 250 feet from a
church, a public or private school, public park or playground, child care
center or neighborhood center. Measurement shall be made in a straight line,
without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the nearest portion
of the building or structure where a computerized internet sweepstakes café is
conducted to the nearest property line of the premises of a church, a public or
private school, social services facility or neighborhood center, or to the
nearest boundary of a public park or playground.
         B.   The use shall be located more than 300 feet from the closest
boundary of a residential district within the Village, the lot line of a
residential use or any structure that contains a residence, or the closest
boundary of a residential district or use in a political subdivision abutting
the Village. Measurement shall be made in a straight line, without regard to
intervening structures or objects, from the nearest portion of the building or
structure where a computerized internet sweepstakes café is conducted to the
nearest property line of a residential use or lot which contains a residence,
or to the nearest boundary of a residential district.
         C.   The propose use shall be located more than 1,000 feet from
another licensed computerized internet sweepstakes café. The distance shall be
measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or
objects, from the closest external wall of the building or structure iin which
each computerized internet sweepstakes café is located.
            (Ord. 2231-11. Passed 12-12-11.)
1151.03 APPROVAL.
   (a)    The Board of Zoning Appeals shall make a determination based on the
information available or it may request additional information. If approved,
the Board shall set forth any specific terms, conditions and safeguards that
shall be required so that the proposed use will conform with the intent and
standards of the district, and it shall instruct in writing the Zoning
Inspector to issue a conditional use permit, which shall be posted and openly
displayed on the premises for which the conditional use permit has been issued.
Council shall be notified of any such action.
   (b)    After the effective date of this section an application for a
conditional use permit may be submitted by an owner for any existing use
requiring such permit, and it shall be issued subject to approval based on the
standards set forth in Section
1151.02.
(Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
1151.04 REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   The approval of the conditional use permit shall become null and void if
such use is not carried out within a six-month period after date of approval.
The Municipality may revoke the conditional use permit upon written evidence by
any resident or official of violation of the Zoning Ordinance and/or the
written terms and conditions upon which approval was granted. A conditional use
permit shall not be transferred to another owner or lessee of such use.

1163.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to designate areas where
Sexually Oriented Businesses may be located in order to promote the health,
safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the Village, and to
establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious
location and concentration of Sexually Oriented Businesses within the Village.
The provisions of this amendment do not have the purpose or effect of imposing
a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials,
including sexually oriented materials. Further, it is not the intent of this
amendment to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials
protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and
exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither
is it the intent nor effect of this amendment to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material.
   (b)   Findings. There is substantial evidence concerning the adverse
secondary effects of adult uses on the community in findings incorporated in
the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986),
Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen
Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and on studies in other communities.

1169.06 MISCELLANEOUS SIGNS.
   (a)   Entrance and Exit Signs. All parking lots may have entrance and exit
signs. Such signs shall be limited to the words "entrance, in, exit, out
shipping, receiving and parking" or other similar directional words
specifically permitted by the Zoning Inspector and may also have arrows or
other appropriate directional indicators. Corporate names, logos, or other non-
directional identification may occupy a maximum area equal to twenty-five
percent (25%) of the sign face. Such signs shall neither exceed five square
feet (5 sq. ft.) in area nor forty-two inches (42") in height, nor be located
closer than three feet (3') to any property line or right-of-way.
   (b)   Changing Signs. Automatic signs (with messages changed by electrical
or electronic alteration of light patterns) including Electronic Message
Centers and manual changeable copy signs (with messages changed by placement
and removal of letters and numbers) may be erected in commercial districts only
and the messages shall be limited to the products and/or services offered for
sale at the business premises. Chalkboards shall not be permitted. Property
owners erecting Electronic Message Centers and automatic changing signs waive
the right to erect any temporary signs on their property. Electronic Message
Centers are prohibited from lots and parcels within or contiguous to the
Historic District.
   (c)   Service Station Signs. Service stations may be permitted up to
eighteen (18) additional square feet on a freestanding sign solely for the
purpose of identifying fuel prices.
   (d)   Industrial Park Signs. Industrial subdivisions containing five (5) or
more lots shall be permitted one free-standing sign identifying the Industrial
Park. Such signs shall be located at the main entrance of the subdivision to
which they refer and shall meet the area, height and set back requirements for
free-standing signs as set forth in Section
1169.05(l).
   (e)   Multi-Tenant Industrial Buildings. Tenants of multi-tenant industrial
buildings who occupy units that do not have an entrance on tile front wall of
the building shall be permitted a wall identification sign at the entrance to
their unit not to exceed 20 square feet in area. Such signs shall conform to
the requirements of wall signs set forth in Section
1169.05(2) and shall comply with the requirements for total signage per lot as
set forth in Section
1169.05.
   (f)   Multi-tenant commercial buildings that have main unit entrances
located on a wall other than the front wall shall be permitted wall
identification signs at the entrance to such units. Signage shall only be
permitted on the unit which the sign advertises. No signage shall be permitted
on walls that do not have main unit entrances unless they comply with the
provision of subsection
 1169.05(3) for sidewall signs. The sign area permitted for individual unit
wall signs for multi-tenant commercial buildings is calculated based on the
unit front wall width.
   (g)   When signage is incorporated into illuminated awnings and canopies,
the entire canopy, length and height shall be considered a sign, not just the
lettering or diagrams.
(Ord. 2172-08. Passed 2-23-09.)
1169.07 SIGN DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Single Tenant Commercial Buildings. Freestanding signs shall be

1173.01 PRELIMINARY PLAN.
   The owner of a tract of land located in a "R-1" or "R-2" district who
proposes to develop such property for more than one single-family or more than
one two family dwelling, and whose proposed development would not otherwise
require compliance with the Village Subdivision Regulations, shall submit to
the Planning Commission for its review, a preliminary plan for the use and
development of such land. Any such proposal for more than one single-family
dwelling shall be designated a "community development project".
(Ord. 1508-88. Passed 5-16-88.)
1173.02 REVIEW OF PLAN.
   In accepting such a plan for review, the Planning Commission must be
satisfied that the proponents of the development project are financially able
to carry out the project; that they intend to start construction within one
year of the approval of the project or of the effective date of any necessary
change in zoning, whichever is later; and intend to complete the development
within a specified time acceptable to the Commission. The Commission may
require a financial statement or such other evidence as may be necessary to
ascertain the financial standing of the proponents and may require signed
statements indicating the proponents will comply with all the requirements of
this section.
(Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
1173.03 DUTIES OF PLANNING COMMISSION.
   It shall be the duty of the Planning Commission to investigate and ascertain
whether the location, size and other characteristics of the site in the
proposed plan comply with the following conditions:
   (a)    That the proposed project is consonant with the comprehensive plan of
the Village;
   (b)    That it will not adversely affect neighboring property;
   (c)    That it will be located on a major thoroughfare;
   (d)    That the project is at a location where traffic congestion does not
exist at present on the streets to be utilized in conjunction therewith, and
where such congestion will not likely be created as a result of the project;
   (e)    That the plan of the project provides for integrated and harmonious
design of buildings, and for adequate and properly arranged facilities for
internal traffic circulation, off-street parking and loading, landscaping and
such other features and facilities as may be necessary to make the project
attractive and efficient from the standpoint of the developer as well as from
the stand point of the adjoining or surrounding existing or potential
developments.
      (Ord. 914. Passed 11-8-66.)
1173.04 REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS.
   The Planning Commission shall take into account that it is increasingly
difficult to forecast the various conditions and factors that may be
encountered in sizable developments, and that certain latitude, flexibility and
freedom in the execution of the design and layout of the project should be
suggested or otherwise permitted by the Commission so as to encourage the
developer to adjust the streets to irregular topography; to take advantage of
topography in order to utilize the natural surface drainage; to economize in
the construction of sewers and storm drainage facilities; to reduce the amount
of grading and thus minimize destruction of trees and topsoil; to adjust the
layout to geographical and cultural limitations; such as property ownership
lines; and among other things to create architectural variation in the
development as well as attractive and usable buildings and building sites. In
doing so, the Commission shall be further guided by the following requirements
and standards:
   (a)    Permitted uses shall be only those as specified in the "R" District
in which located;
   (b)    Building height requirement shall be the same as in the "R" District
involved;
   (c)    The average of the lot areas per family or dwelling unit shall not be
reduced more than ten percent (10%) of the specified area requirements or
standards for the district in which located. The front yard, the frontage, the
width, depth, side or rear yard shall not be reduced by more than twenty
percent (20%) of the specified minimum for the district in which located when
necessitated by topographical or geographical considerations or due to the
layout, location and specifications for connection to public sanitary sewers
and/or water systems within the Village. In no case shall the overall density
exceed the amount permitted for the district in which the property is located;
   (d)    Service drives and other service facilities shall be located entirely
within the project site;
    (e)    The plans shall provide for such suitable street improvement or
widening as may be necessary to facilitate the circulation of vehicular
traffic; installation of adequate storm drainage; the appropriate extension of
public utilities, including sanitary sewers, storm drainage, and water mains
along street frontage; and suitable screen planting and landscaping;
   (f)    The developer shall provide a minimum of one acre, exclusive of
rights of way, of land which shall be held contiguously and of such condition
and shape as to be usable for recreation, whether active or passive, for each
ten acres or fraction thereof devoted to the development. In addition, the
developer shall provide additional land for recreational use equal to the same
percentage of total acreage as that percentage exceeds ten percent (10%)
variance for reduction of the frontage requirements that would otherwise be
required for the district in which the property is located. Such land shall be
in addition to that contained in lots or within the road rights of way, and
such open space devoted to recreational use shall not include any land within a
right of way and such land shall be held and conveyed to a homeowner's
association incorporated under the laws of the State for the benefit of the
owners of building sites which are within the development and the developer
shall incorporate into the protective covenants and/or deed restrictions a
clause requiring each owner of a building site to be a member of the
homeowner's association and further providing in the protective covenants and/
or deed restrictions that the association shall hold title to such open space
which shall be used for recreation purposes only whether passive or active. No
structures other than those incidental to the recreational use of the open
space shall be permitted on the open space. The developer shall further provide
in the deed restrictions and/or protective covenants that each owner of a
building site as a member of the homeowner's association shall be required to
maintain and preserve land set aside as open space for recreational purposes,
and provide for enforcement by the Village, developer or homeowners. In the
event such open space exceeds three acres in contiguous area, at the option of
the Village, the developer may set aside at no cost to the Village such open
space if accepted by the Village;
   (g)    In order for the Commission to better determine that the development
meets all requirements, the developer shall furnish an overall plan of the
entire tract showing topography, roads, lot lines, lot areas, easements,
encumbrances and other relevant data submitted in accordance with the
Subdivision Regulations to the Planning Commission with the addition of the
location of individual houses, structures, areas of shrubs and/or trees of one
foot diameter or more, existing contours, the location of all water courses and
existing or proposed drainage ways or easements and proposed grading;
   (h)    Upon determination by the Commission that the proposed development
project as shown by the preliminary plan thereof conforms to the requirements
of all applicable provisions of this chapter, the proponent shall prepare and
submit a final development plan. Such plan shall incorporate any changes or
modifications required by the Commission, and shall present all protective
covenants and/or deed restrictions showing ownership of the open space and an
incorporated homeowner's association with the obligation of the association to
maintain and preserve the open space to be set aside for recreational purposes
and such language will be subject to approval of the Commission;
   (i)    The Commission shall hold a public hearing following the procedure
for notice of such hearing and following the procedure at the hearing as is
required of the Zoning Board of Appeals in Section
1117.03.

1189.01 REVIEW OF PLANS REQUIRED.
   The owner of a tract of land in an "M-3" District shall submit to the
Planning Commission for its review and approval plans for the use and
development of Industrial Park facilities prior to the actual development of
land for such use. No such development of any land in an "M-3" District shall
commence until the Commission shall review and approve the plans for such usage
in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and the Subdivision
Regulations.
(Ord. 1307-84. Passed 2-20-84.)
1189.02 FINANCIAL DATA; TIME LIMITATIONS.
   In accepting such a plan for review, the Planning Commission must be
satisfied that the proponents of the development project are financially able
to carry out the project; that they intend to start construction within one
year of the approval of the project or the effective date of any necessary
change or variance in zoning, whichever is later; and intend to complete the
development within a specified time acceptable to the Commission. The
Commission may require a financial statement or such other evidence as may be
necessary to ascertain the financial standing of proponents and the required
signed statements indicating the proponents will comply with all the
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 1307-84. Passed 2-20-84.)
1189.03 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the "M-3" Industrial Park District is to provide a protective
zone for a park-like development of industry that is based on the performance
of an industry as well as on the type of industry. In order to secure this type
of development, the various regulations herein described in this chapter must
be met. These regulations are established in order to provide a long term
beneficial operating environment for industry; for the protection of industry
from the encroachment of commercial and residential uses adverse to the
operation and expansion of such industry; to protect industries within the
district from the adverse effect of other incompatible industries; and, at the
same time, to reduce to a minimum the impact of industries on surrounding
nonindustrial land uses; to lessen traffic congestion; to protect the health
and safety of the residents or workers in the area; to prevent detrimental
effects to the use or development of adjacent properties or the general
neighborhood; and to promote the health, safety, morals, comfort and welfare of
the present and future inhabitants of the Village.
(Ord. 1307-84. Passed 2-20-84.)
1189.04 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED; VIOLATIONS.
   Continued compliance with standards established in this chapter is required
and enforcement of continued compliance of these performance standards shall be
enforced by the Zoning Inspector and/or Planning Commission. Any violation of
these standards, either before or after development commences shall be
terminated immediately upon notice from the Zoning Inspector and/or Planning
Commission and any violation shall be cause for denial of a zoning permit,
building permit, or any equitable relief that the Village may seek and may also
be subject to fines as more fully set forth in the Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 1307-84. Passed 2-20-84.)
1189.05 INVESTIGATIONS BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   The Planning Commission shall investigate and ascertain if the plans for the
development comply with the following conditions. Such conditions must be
complied with by the applicant in order to receive a zoning permit to develop
their property for an Industrial Park District or to construct any facility or
structure within the "M-3" Industrial Park District:
   (a)    That the proposed project is consonant with the Comprehensive Plan of
the Village;
   (b)    That it will not adversely affect neighboring property;

date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.

rules of the Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order,
standard or rule of the Divisions of State Fire Marshal or Industrial
Compliance in the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Health and of
counties and townships, in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are
in conflict with the rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that
rules adopted and orders issued by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Ohio R.C.

submission of reports and any requested special information to the Board of
Building Standards as required in paragraph (F) of Rule 4101: 7-2-01 of the
Administrative Code. Failure to submit these reports as required by rule or by
special request or inquiry of the Board of Building Standards may be grounds
for Board action as described in paragraph (F)(7) of Rule 4101:7-3-01 of the
Administrative Code.
   (h)   Liability. Liability of certified Building Department personnel for
any tortious act will be determined by Ohio courts to the applicable provisions

1337.01 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person shall move or cause to be moved any building, other than frame
sheds, frame garages and similar accessory buildings, within, into, through or
from the Village, without first obtaining a permit therefor from the Zoning
Inspector, such permit to be known as a house moving permit. Any person
desiring such permit shall file with the Zoning Inspector a written application
therefor.
1337.02 APPLICATION INFORMATION.
   (a)    Moving Within or Into Village. If an application is for moving a
building entirely within the Village limits or for the moving of a building
into the Village from another location, such application shall specify the
following:
      (1)    The character and size of the building to be moved;
      (2)    The reason for such moving;
      (3)    The purpose and occupancy for which such building is to be used;
      (4)    The locations from which and to which such building is to be
moved;
      (5)    A plot plan showing the proposed location of the building upon the
property to which such building is to be moved;
      (6)    The streets on, over or through which it is desired to move such
building, indicating exactly and in detail the route to be followed in moving.
A copy of this information shall also be given to the Chief of Police by the
applicant;
      (7)    Whether the building conforms to this Building Code and the
Planning and Zoning Code and whether it conforms to the architecture of the
buildings in the immediate area within which it is to be located; and
      (8)    The date or dates the building will be moved.
   (b)    Moving Out of or Through Village. If the building is being moved from
within or through the Village to a location outside the Village limits, the
application shall contain the following:
      (1)    The character and size of the building to be moved;
      (2)    The reason for such moving;
      (3)    The locations from which and to which such building is to be
moved;
      (4)    The streets on, over or through which it is desired to move such

applicant; and
      (5)    The date or dates the building will be moved.
1337.03 INVESTIGATION.
   Upon the filing of the application, the Zoning Inspector shall investigate
the physical condition of the building. If he finds that it can be moved safely
in the manner proposed and that the proposed location thereof will violate no
ordinance, he shall cause a permit to be issued to the applicant.
1337.04 MOVING UNFIT BUILDINGS.
   No permit shall be issued to move any building which, in the opinion of the
Zoning Inspector, is so constructed or is in such condition as to be dangerous,
is infected with pests or is unsanitary; or if it is a dwelling unfit for human
habitation, in a dilapidated condition, defective or in such a condition of
deterioration or disrepair that its relocation at the proposed site would cause
appreciable harm to, or be materially detrimental to, other property or
improvements in the Village; or if the building is of a type prohibited at the
proposed location by any statute of the State or ordinance of the Village; or
if the use of the building at the new location is in violation of the statutes
of the State or the ordinances of the Village; or if the moving of the building
would cause unreasonable damage to trees, plants, shrubs or utility poles on or
along the public streets. However, if the condition of the building, in the
opinion of the Zoning Inspector, is capable of practicable and effective
repair, the permit may be issued upon the terms and conditions set forth in
this chapter.
1337.05 SCOPE OF PERMIT.
   Issuance of a permit to an applicant shall not be construed as approval by
the Village of any violation of a State statute or Village ordinance.
1337.06 PERMIT CONDITIONS.
   A house moving permit shall be granted only after the applicant accepts and
complies with the following terms and conditions:
   (a)    Applicants shall not allow the building being moved to remain upon or
in any manner to obstruct the public streets, other than between the hours of
10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. unless approved by the Chief of Police.
   (b)    Applicants must deposit with the Clerk-Treasurer, prior to receiving
the permit, a sum which is double the amount estimated by the Zoning Inspector
to be necessary to reimburse the Village for the cost of trimming, moving,
removing or replanting trees or shrubs and of moving, removing or displacing
any poles or structures belonging to the Village. The cost thereof shall be
estimated by the Zoning Inspector and his determination shall be final.
   (c)    Applicants must have procured in writing the permission of the owners
of any trees, shrubs, fences, poles, wires, cables or any other physical
structures which must be moved, removed or displaced in order to allow passage
of the building. The permit to move such building will not be issued until such
written permissions are filed with the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (d)    Applicants must deposit with the Clerk-Treasurer a sufficient sum to
be used to pay the overtime wages of any policemen which the Chief of Police
determines are necessary to employ in order to direct traffic and warn
pedestrians and motorists of the obstruction of a building in the process of
being moved over and upon public streets.
   (e)    Applicants shall file with the Clerk-Treasurer a liability insurance
policy issued by a solvent insurance company authorized to do business in the
State, which policy shall conform in all respects to the requirements of this
chapter. However, in lieu of filing such insurance policy, a certificate may be
filed which shows that a policy meeting the requirements of this section has
been issued, and the same shall set forth the expiration date of such policy.
1337.07 LIABILITY INSURANCE.
   The liability policy required under Section
1337.06 shall insure the person, partnership, corporation or other organization
moving a building against loss from liability imposed by law for injury or
death to any person, and for injury to the property of any person, including
the Village, that occurs while the mover of a building is so engaged upon the
streets of the Village. Such policy shall insure the mover in the amounts set
forth hereafter, exclusive of interest and costs:
   (a)    For injury to, or for the death of, any one person, two hundred
thousand dollars ($200,000);
   (b)    For injuries to, or for the deaths of, or for any combination of
injuries and deaths of, more than one person arising from any single accident,
five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000);
   (c)    For damage to the property of any person, including the Village,
arising from any single incident, fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) per
incident.
1337.08 PERMIT ISSUANCE; FEE.
   The permit shall be issued by the Zoning Inspector after the above
conditions have been complied with and agreed to and after the applicant has
paid a fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) therefor. The Zoning Inspector shall
not issue such permit until he has received notification from the Clerk-
Treasurer and the Chief of Police that all requirements of their offices have
been complied with.
1337.09 NOTICE OF MOVING.
   Notice must be given by the person to whom the permit is issued, or his
representative to both the Zoning Inspector and the Chief of Police not less
than thirty-six hours before the actual work of moving a building or structure
is to commence.
1337.10 FAILURE TO PERFORM WORK.
   Whenever a default has occurred in the performance of any term or condition
of any permit, written notice thereof shall be given to the permittee by the
Zoning Inspector. Such notice shall state the work to be done, the estimated
cost thereof and the period of time deemed to be reasonably necessary to
complete such work.
   After receipt of such notice, the permittee must, within the time therein
specified, either cause the work to be done or pay over to the Clerk-Treasurer
the estimated cost of doing such work as set forth in the notice, plus ten
percent thereof. Upon receipt of notice from the Clerk that the permittee has
deposited such money, the Zoning Inspector shall cause the required work to be
performed and completed. If the permittee defaults and fails to complete the
moving of the building, the Village shall have the option, in lieu of
completing the work required, to demolish the building and to clear, clean and
restore the site or sites.
1337.11 APPROVAL OF STREETS; MOVING EQUIPMENT.
   The streets over which any building is to be moved must be approved by the
Zoning Inspector and the Chief of Police. No structure shall be moved in the
Village until the manner in which the moving is to be accomplished, the
equipment to be used and the loading wheels, rollers and other equipment that
will come in contact with Village pavements have been approved by the
Inspector.
1337.12 FOUNDATION TO BE READY.
   No person, either as mover or the one causing the moving to be done, as
owner of the real property or as the owner of a building, shall permit any
building which has been moved to be placed upon any real property within the
Village unless a suitable foundation has already been erected and is ready for
the building to be placed and anchored upon such foundation.
1337.13 LIGHTS AND BARRICADES.
   The person having charge of the moving of any building shall maintain at all
times proper flags, lights, barricades and other danger signals, whenever such
building is on any public street.
1337.14 DAMAGE TO STREETS; REMEDIES OF VILLAGE.
   In the event that the moving of any building for which a permit has been
granted under this chapter caused damage to the public streets or other public
property and improvements, then in addition to any other remedy the Village may
have, the Zoning Inspector may cause such damage to be repaired, and the costs
thereof deducted from the deposit required by Section
1337.06(b), or the Zoning Inspector may require the person to whom such a
permit has been granted, or his authorized representative, upon written
notification from the Zoning Inspector, to make all necessary repairs to such
streets or property and improvements. However, should such person to whom such
permit has been granted and to whom such notice has been given, or his
authorized representative, fail to make such necessary repairs within the
period of time designated in such written notice, the Zoning Inspector may
cause such necessary repairs to be made and the costs thereof deducted from the
deposit required by Section
1337.06(b), or may proceed to exercise any other remedies which the Village may
have.
1337.15 DEPOSIT REFUND.
   When the moving of any building for which a permit has been granted is
completed and all damage to public streets or other public property has been
repaired, and the cost of repairing the damage and of performing other work as
provided for in this chapter has been paid out of the deposit required by
Section
1337.06 (b), such portion of the deposit then remaining unused under the
provisions of this chapter shall be refunded, upon the surrender of the deposit
receipt. Should the cost, however, of repairing the aforesaid damage or
performing other work exceed the total amount of money deposited, the person to
whom such permit was granted shall be liable for the amount of damages or other
costs which are in excess of the amount deposited.
1337.16 PERMIT REVOCATION; APPEAL.
   The Zoning Inspector or the Chief of Police may at any time, for sufficient
cause, revoke or suspend any permit granted under this chapter. Any person
excepting to any denials, suspensions or revocations of a permit applied for or
held by him pursuant to any of the provisions of this chapter, or to any other
action taken by any official of the Village concerning such permit, may appeal
in writing to Council by filing with the Clerk-Treasurer written notice of such
appeal, setting forth the specific grounds thereof.
   Such notice must be filed within fourteen days after notice of the action
appealed from is received by the appellant, but in no event later than thirty
days after the date of such action. The Clerk-Treasurer shall set the matter
for hearing before Council at the next Council meeting and cause notice thereof
to be given to the appellant not less than five days prior thereto. At such
hearing the appellant must show cause, on the grounds specified in the notice
of appeal, why the action excepted to should not be approved. Council may
continue such hearing from time to time, and its findings on the appeal shall
be final and conclusive in the matter.
1337.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall be fined not
more than fifty ($50.00) dollars. A separate offense shall be deemed committed
each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.

1347.01 IMPROVEMENTS TO LAND; PLANS AND MAPS REQUIRED.
   (a)    Exempting the Village, its authorized contractors, and those
applicants qualifying under subsection (c) hereof, every person, firm, or
corporation (hereinafter the “applicant”) who or which proposes to improve land
by grading or excavation, or by the construction or erection of a building or
structure of any kind, or by the construction, installation, and maintenance of
ponds, lakes, drainage ways, sanitary and/or storm sewers or similar devices,
or who proposes to remove, place, or relocate natural topsoil (hereinafter
these described purposes shall be referred to as “improvements”), shall, prior
to performing such improvements, submit to the Secretary of the Planning
Commission three copies of a “Grading Plan”, to include a site and grading
plan, generally describing the proposed improvements, and containing the
matters set forth in Section 1347.02, along with the deposit required in
subsection (b) hereof.
      (1)    The Secretary shall immediately forward such Grading Plan to the
Village Engineer, who shall review it and make a determination whether or not
such proposed improvements would likely result in significant erosion or
siltation of adjoining property or properties. Proposed erosion and sediment
pollution control practices shall conform to the requirements set forth in the
Geauga County Soil and Sediment Pollution Control Regulations (hereinafter
“County Regulations”) in effect at the time of submittal. If the Engineer
determines such significant erosion or siltation is not likely to result, and
that the requirements of the County Regulations will be met, then he shall
approve or conditionally approve such Grading Plan. Unless a “Plot Plan” is
also required to be submitted pursuant to Section
1347.03, the applicant may proceed to construct, grade, or otherwise improve
the land in accordance with such Grading Plan.
      (2)    In the event the Village Engineer, after review of the Grading
Plan, finds significant erosion and siltation is likely to result on adjoining
property or properties from the proposed improvements and/or the requirements
of the County Regulations will not be met, he shall recommend or prescribe
changes to the Grading Plan to correct or reduce such impact. If the applicant
agrees to such recommendations, they shall be deemed part of the Grading Plan
and the applicant may proceed in accordance therewith (unless also required to
file a Plot Plan in accordance with Section
1347.03).
      (3)    The Village Engineer may condition his approval of any Grading
Plan upon a deposit by the applicant in cash or surety bond in an amount not to
exceed twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500), intended to ensure that all
erosion control devices, including permanent vegetation, as required by the
Grading Plan, are properly installed. Any deposit so required shall not be
released to the applicant until the Village Engineer is satisfied that all
required soil and erosion control devices have been installed and all other
conditions of approval have been met by the applicant.
      (4)    In the event no agreement is reached between the applicant and the
Village Engineer, then the applicant shall thereafter submit to the Planning
Commission, through its Secretary, six copies of such Grading Plan, which shall
thereafter conduct a review in accordance with the procedures set out in
Section 1347.04.
   (b)    At the time of the submission of the Grading Plan to the Planning
Commission Secretary, the applicant shall deposit with the Secretary three
hundred dollars ($300.00) to cover the cost and expense of the Engineer's
review process. Such costs and expenses shall be deducted from such deposit. If
expenditures exceed the deposit, such excess shall be paid to the Commission
Secretary by the applicant upon written request. If the deposit exceeds
expenditures, the balance shall be refunded to the applicant at the time of the
approval of the Grading Plan.
   (c)    The provisions of this section shall not apply to those applicants
who are required to either:
      (1)    Obtain development review approval of the proposed improvement
pursuant to the Village Zoning Code; or
      (2)    Obtain Village Engineer approval pursuant to the improvement plan
review procedures for major subdivisions of the Village Subdivision
Regulations.

   In the event the Village Engineer, after review of the Plot Plan, finds
either unreasonable adverse erosion or sedimentation impact upon neighboring
properties is likely, or the building or structure itself would be subject to
adverse drainage consequences, or the County Regulations will not be met, he
shall recommend or prescribe changes to the Plot Plan to correct or reduce such
impacts. If the applicant agrees to such recommendations, they shall be deemed
part of the Plot Plan and the applicant may proceed in accordance therewith, so
long as Grading Plan approval has likewise been obtained.
   In the event no agreement is reached between the applicant and the Village
Engineer, then the applicant shall thereafter submit to the Planning
Commission, through its Secretary, six copies of such Plot Plan, which shall
thereafter conduct a review in accordance with the procedures set out in
Section 1347.04.
   (c)    The provisions of this section shall not apply to those applicants
who are required to either:
      (1)    Obtain development review approval of the proposed improvement
pursuant to the Village Zoning Code; or,
      (2)    Obtain Village Engineer approval pursuant to the improvement plan
review procedures for major subdivisions of the Village Subdivision
regulations.
         (Ord. 1912-97. Passed 8-18-97.)
 
1347.04 APPEAL TO PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)    Upon submission of the six copies of the Grading and/or Plot Plan to
the Planning Commission, and any required deposit, the Commission shall review
such Plan(s) and any recommendations or comments by the Village Engineer at its
next regularly scheduled meeting. The Commission shall consider the severity of
any potential impact of erosion and/or siltation upon neighboring properties,
the impact of drainage upon any building or structure proposed to be
constructed, the recommendations of the Engineer, the costs of any proposed
erosion control devices compared to the benefits to be obtained therefrom, the
County Regulations, and shall approve or disapprove such Plan as submitted or
amended within thirty days. The Planning Commission shall not approve any plans
unless it is satisfied the Plan demonstrates the proposed improvements shall
not significantly adversely impact the surrounding properties through erosion
or siltation, and any building or structure proposed to be constructed shall
not be subject to adverse drainage consequences, and that the County
Regulations will be met.
   (b)    Such approval by the Planning Commission may include a requirement of
a date certain in which permanent vegetation shall be installed upon all
disturbed land. (For the purpose of this chapter, “permanent vegetation” means
the installation of grass seed, grass sod, or other ground cover installed with
the intent to be permanently placed on the ground and providing erosion and/or
sedimentation control over the land to be covered.)
   (c)    The Planning Commission may also condition its approval of any Plan
upon a deposit by the applicant in cash or surety bond in an amount not to
exceed twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500), intended to ensure that all
erosion control devices, including permanent vegetation, as required by any
Plan are properly installed. Any deposit so required shall not be released to
the applicant until the Village Engineer is satisfied that all required soil
and erosion control devices have been installed and all other conditions of
approval have been met by the applicant.
 
   (d)    After such Planning Commission approval, the applicant may proceed in
accordance with such approved Plan(s).
(Ord. 1912-97. Passed 8-18-97.)
 
1347.05 FINAL PLOT PLAN.
   Upon completion of the improvements, each applicant shall file with the
Village Engineer a Final Plot Plan, which plan shall show the final grades of
the improvement as constructed. Such plan shall be certified by a registered
engineer or registered surveyor as to the accuracy of the plan, depicting the
actual construction, and as to whether or not such engineer or surveyor has
made an actual filed observation of as-built conditions and that these
conditions are as shown on the plan. The form of such certification shall be
prescribed by the Village Engineer and shall contain the following information:
   (a)    Sufficient point elevations to assure that planned swales and
drainage courses have been constructed;
   (b)    Sufficient point elevations to ensure that all drainage is positive
and sloping away from dwelling;
   (c)    Provide sideline and set-back “as-built” dimensions;
   (d)    Provide garage, patio and finished first floor elevations;
   (e)    Provide "as-built" dimensions around perimeter of building;
    (f)    Provide finished found grades at major building corners.
      (Ord. 1912-97. Passed 8-18-97.)
1347.06 DEPOSIT; PLOT PLAN.
   Each person, firm or corporation required to file a Plot Plan under Section
1347.03 shall also deposit cash in the amount of five hundred dollars
($500.00). Such deposit shall be returned to the applicant only upon such
satisfactory proof to the Village Engineer of compliance with this Chapter
1347, the improvements were properly installed, submission of a Final Plot Plan
as required under Section
1347.05, installation of permanent vegetation, approval of the Final Plot Plan
by the Village Engineer and deduction of all costs of the Village in approving
the Final Plot Plan and assuring compliance with this Chapter
1347. If, after the installation of improvements the applicant fails to submit
a Final Plot Plan within sixty days, or the Village Engineer determines there
has not been satisfactory proof of compliance with this Chapter
1347, or timely compliance as set forth within any Grading Plan or Plot Plan
approval, the deposit shall be forfeited to the Village upon application of the
Village Engineer to the Planning Commission and upon approval of the Planning
Commission at a public hearing, for which the owner of the deposited funds
shall have been given prior notice and an opportunity to show cause why such
deposit should not be forfeited.
(Ord. 1912-97. Passed 8-18-97.)
1347.07 STOP WORK ORDERS.
   (a)    In the event the Zoning Inspector or Village Engineer finds that any
improvements are being made to any land subject to this chapter in violation of
the approved Grading Plan conditions, or the approved Plot Plan, or any
regulations set forth in this chapter, the Zoning Inspector or Village Engineer
shall give written notice to the person, firm, or entity responsible for
construction of such improvements, notifying them of the violation of this
chapter or of the Plan approval conditions. The Zoning Inspector or Village
Engineer may issue a Stop Work Order or an adjudicative order and take such
other legal or equitable action to enjoin any further construction of
improvements upon any land where land disturbance has occurred.
   (b)    In the event the status of the improvement activity at the time such
Stop Work or adjudicative order is issued is such as to create a risk of
probable adverse environmental impact or erosion harm, the Village Engineer may
require the applicant, or the owner if different from the applicant, to
immediately undertake sufficient remedial measures to prevent such impact or
harm. Such remedial measures shall be as prescribed by the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 1912-97. Passed 8-18-97.)
   
1347.08 TEMPORARY EROSION CONTROL DEVICES.
   In the event the Village Engineer determines the status of any improvement
activities being conducted in the Village as of October 15 of any year,
including any single-family, subdivision, multi-family, commercial, or
industrial development, are such as to create a likelihood of adverse
environmental impact or erosion harm during the subsequent winter season, then
the Village Engineer shall require the applicant to undertake temporary
seeding, mulching, or other appropriate measures for the purpose of providing
temporary erosion control devices until improvement activities may safely
resume. Such temporary erosion controls may be in addition to or supplement
those devices already required under the terms of any approved Grading or Plot
Plan.

1349.01 FIRE LOSS INSURANCE PROCEEDS.
   The Village adopts and follows the procedure set forth in Ohio R.C. 3929.86
whereby no insurance company doing business in the State shall pay a claim of a
named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the Village where
the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all policies
exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) unless there is compliance with the
following procedures:
   (a)   (1)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds
and the company or companies equals or exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the
aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or
structure, the insurance company or companies in accordance with Ohio R.C.
715.26(F) shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Village Clerk in
the aggregate two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) for each fifteen thousand
dollars ($15,000.00) and each fraction of that amount, of a claim, or if at the
time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the
insurance company or companies the named insured or insureds have submitted a
contractor’s signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing
the building or other structure, shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the
amount specified in the estimate. Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro
rata basis by all companies insuring the building or other structure. Policy
proceeds remaining after the transfer to the Village shall be disbursed in
accordance with the policy terms. The named insured or insureds may submit a
contractor’s signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing
the building or other structure after the transfer, and the designated officer
shall return the amount of the fund in excess of the estimate to the named
insured or insureds, provided that the Village has not commenced to remove,
repair or secure the building or other structure.
      (2)   At the request of the owner/insured, the Village Engineer will
inspect the property after repair/demolition and authorize the Village Clerk to
return the deposit to the insured. Any subsequent inspection by the Village
Engineer conducted to confirm compliance will result in a fee of one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) charged against the insurance proceeds for each
occurrence.
   (b)   (1)   Upon receipt of the proceeds by the Village as authorized by
this section, the Village Clerk shall place the proceeds in the Village
Treasury in a separate sub-fund, to be used solely as security against the
total cost of removing, repairing or securing incurred by the Village pursuant
to Ohio R.C. 715.261. When transferring the funds as required in subsection (a)
hereof an insurance company shall provide the Village with the name and address
of the named insured or insureds, whereupon the Village shall contact the named
insured or insureds, certify that the proceeds received by the Village and
notify them that the following procedures will be followed:
      (2)   The fund shall be returned to the named insured or insureds when
repairs or removal or securing of the building or other structure have been
completed and the required proof received by the designated officer, if the
Village has not incurred any costs for such repairs, removal or securing. If
the Village has incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing of the
building or other structure, such costs shall be paid from the fund and if
excess funds remain, the Village shall transfer the remaining funds to the
named insured or insureds. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit
the ability of a municipal corporation to recover any deficiency under Ohio
R.C. 715.261.
      (3)   Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the
municipal corporation and the named insured or insureds from entering into an
agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured or insureds
if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been
negotiated.
   (c)   The Village Clerk is hereby designated as the officer authorized to
carry out the duties of this section. The Village Clerk shall file a certified
copy of this section with the Superintendent of Insurance of the State.
