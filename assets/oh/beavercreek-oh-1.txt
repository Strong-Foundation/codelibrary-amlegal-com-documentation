at the time of appointment, the appointee shall serve until a successor for the
term is certified at the next November general election whether in an odd or
even year, which occurs at least one hundred (100) days after his or her
appointment (so as to allow nominating petitions to be filed by the ninety

term. If at the time of appointment less than two (2) years remain of the

his official duties or for his removal from office.

sessions of Council shall be deemed to be confidential by virtue of the status
of the proceedings involved and the circumstances that gave rise to the
executive session. Preserving the confidentiality of executive session
information and discussions is declared to be necessary to the proper conduct
of the government of the city.
(Ord. 85-48, passed 12-9-85)
         (b)   No person may discuss any such confidential information or
discussion without appropriate authorization from Council. Any person who

meetings requiring immediate Council action, the Clerk shall give immediate
oral notification to the news media that have requested notification of the
time, place, and purpose of the meeting.

notice of such special meeting shall file with the Clerk of Council a written
request therefore on a standard form to be provided by the Clerk.

address, or if by telephone, at the telephone number, of such person as shown
on the records kept by the Clerk for these purposes. Any notification provided
herein to be given by the Clerk may be given by any person acting on behalf of
or under the authority of the Clerk. A reasonable attempt at notification shall

upon the city and Council. The Clerk shall maintain a record of the date and
manner, and time, if pertinent, of all actions taken with regard to notices and
notifications required herein.
   (J)   Call of the house. In the absence of a quorum, any business
transacted, except for the actions noted in subsection (1) of this division, is
null and void. The absence of a quorum in no way detracts from the fact that
the rules were complied with and the meeting was held even though it had to
adjourn immediately.
      (1)   The only action that can be taken legally in the absence of a
quorum is to fix the time to which to adjourn, adjourn, recess, or to take
measures to obtain a quorum. In the last category, a motion that absent members
be contacted during a recess and asked to attend would represent such a
measure. The prohibition against transacting business in the absence of a
quorum cannot be waived even by unanimous consent.
      (2)   If a quorum is not present and there appears to be no prospect that
a quorum will assemble, a vote of three Councilmembers may compel the
attendance of the absent Councilmembers.
      (3)   When a call of the house is ordered, the Clerk shall call the roll
of the Councilmembers, and again call the names of the absentees in whose
behalf explanations of absence can be made and excuses can be requested. After
this, no member is permitted to leave, and the Chief of Police or other
arresting officer shall be ordered to take into custody absentees who have not
been excused from attendance and bring them before the Council. This action is
to be taken on a warrant signed by the presiding officer and attested by the
Clerk.
      (4)   When the previously absent Councilmembers are brought in, their
explanations shall be heard separately and, on motion, they may be excused with
or without penalty in the form of a payment of a fee which is to be one-twelfth
of their annual salary.
      (5)   After a call of the house has been ordered, no motion is in order,
even by unanimous consent, except motions relating to the call. Motions to
adjourn or dispense with further proceedings under the call, however, can be
entertained after a quorum is present, or after the arresting officer reports
that in his opinion a quorum cannot be obtained.
      (6)   An adjournment terminates all proceedings under the call of the
house.

specified matter. Public hearings shall be held by the Council as required by
the ordinances of the city, the Charter, the laws of the state, and when in the
opinion of a majority of the Council, the public interest is served by such a
hearing.
      (1)   The Mayor or Vice Mayor shall normally preside at public hearings,
however, Council may appoint one of its other members as presiding officer or

attendance of witnesses and production of books and papers.
(Am. Ord. 84-27, passed 4-9-84)
      (2)   The presiding officer shall conduct such public hearings as may be
held, and shall set forth rules of procedure and conduct for the hearing. Such
rules may be amended or waived by a majority vote of the quorum.

any public hearing.

issue. Repetitive testimony will not be accepted and unruly outbursts will not
be tolerated. Courtesy shall be extended to all speakers on the question.
         (b)   Any speaker desiring to address Council shall be recognized by
the presiding officer and shall state his or her name and address in an audible
tone for the record. Remarks shall be limited to the question at hand to ensure
that as many views as possible be recognized.
         (c)   All questions and comments shall be addressed to the presiding

§ 31.13   DUTIES AND PRIVILEGES OF MEMBERS.
   (A)   Addressing the chair. A member, when about to speak to a question or
make a motion, shall first be recognized by the presiding officer who shall
pronounce the name of the member entitled to the floor. All discussion shall be
confined to the question under debate and avoid personalities.
   (B)   Limitation of discussion. No member shall be allowed to speak more
than one time upon any subject until every member choosing to speak has had an

   (C)   Appeals. Should any member transgress the rules of Council, the
presiding officer shall, or any member may, call him or her to order, and in
the latter instance the presiding officer shall render a decision as to the
point of order. In case of an appeal from a ruling of the presiding officer,
the question shall be, “Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the decision
of Council?” The presiding officer shall be sustained unless overruled by a
majority vote of the members of Council present.
   (D)   Motions. When a motion is made, it may be restated by the Clerk before
voting upon request by any Councilmember. Any member may require that it be
reduced to writing. A motion may be withdrawn by the mover at any time previous
to the vote. Unless otherwise required by law or where these rules specify
otherwise, a motion shall be deemed passed if it receives the affirmative vote
of a majority of the members present.
   (E)   Voting. Voting shall be by voice vote unless a roll call vote is
requested by a Councilmember or required by law.
      (1)   The presiding officer or the Clerk shall declare the vote after the

express it by voting. However, a member cannot be compelled to do so by any
rule and may therefore abstain from voting.
   (G)   A Councilmember who is present at a meeting but who abstains from
voting on an ordinance or resolution shall not be counted with the majority of
Councilmembers voting on the legislation but shall be deemed for the purpose of
determining the passage of the legislation to have remained in a neutral
position. A Councilmember who abstains from voting on an ordinance or
resolution shall be recorded as “abstaining” by the Clerk.
   (H)   All actions and decisions of the Council shall be taken and made by
affirmative vote of a majority of Council members present, except to the extent

unexpired term shall be placed on a Council meeting agenda. Recorded roll call
votes, cast in alphabetical order of the last names of members, shall be taken
to determine which candidate is favored by a majority of the Councilmembers. If
more than one vote is necessary to select the favored candidate, those
applicants with the lowest numbers of votes, or with no votes, shall be
eliminated from further consideration after each vote provided, however, that
the top two vote recipients and those candidates tied in any vote shall not be
eliminated from consideration in further votes. After one candidate obtains a
majority vote of the remaining members of Council, a motion to appoint that
candidate shall be in order. A recorded roll call vote shall be conducted on
the motion. The Councilmember elect must be duly sworn before entering upon the
duties of Council.
   (L)   Robert's Rules of Order. In the absence of any Council rule upon the
matter of business, Council shall be governed by the ordinary rules governing
legislative bodies as laid down and set forth in Robert's Rules of Order.

against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid
in settlement or incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, or investigative, to which such Director, officer,
agent, or employee was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party by
reason of the fact that he is or was such Director, officer, agent, or
employee, to the extent that any such expenses or amounts were actually
incurred, provided:
         (a)   That he acted in good faith in what he reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; and
         (b)   That, in any matter the subject of a criminal action, suit or
proceeding, he had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was
unlawful.
      (2)   The determination as to (a) and (b) above shall be made (i) by the
Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who
were not and are not parties to or threatened with any such action, suit or
proceeding, or any other action, suit or proceeding arising from the same or
similar operative facts, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or even if
obtainable if a majority of such quorum of disinterested Directors so directs,
in a written opinion by independent legal counsel other than an attorney, or a
firm having associated with it an attorney, who has been retained by or who has
performed services for the Corporation, or any person to have been so
indemnified within the past five years; or (iii) by the Court of Common Pleas
or the court in which the action, suit or proceeding was brought.
      (3)   The termination of any claim, action, suit, or proceeding by
judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of guilty or nolo
contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that
such person did not meet the standards of conduct referred to above.
      (4)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any action by or on behalf of the
Corporation, no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or
matter as to which such present or former Director, officer, agent, or employee
shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the
performance of his duty to the Corporation unless, and only to the extent that,
the Court of Common Pleas or the court in which such action or suit was brought
shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability,
but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such present or former
Director, officer, agent, or employee is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses as the court shall deem proper.
      (5)   To the extent that any such person has been successful on the
merits or otherwise with respect to any action, suit or proceeding referred to
above, or in the defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person
shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and
reasonably incurred in connection therewith without the determination specified
above.
      (6)   The Corporation may pay expenses, including attorneys' fees,
incurred in connection with defending any action, suit or proceeding referred
to above prior to final disposition thereof, as authorized by the Board of
Directors upon receipt of a satisfactory undertaking by such person to repay
such amount, unless it shall ultimately be determined that such person is
entitled to indemnification by the Corporation as herein authorized.
      (7)   The indemnification provided by this subchapter shall not be deemed
exclusive of, or in any way to limit, any other rights to which any person
seeking indemnification may be entitled as a matter of law, by the Articles,
regulations, agreements, insurance, or otherwise, with respect to acting in his
official capacity, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
Director, officer, agent, or employee, and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
   (B)   The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a Director, officer, agent, or employee, against any
liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any capacity, or arising
out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power
to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this subchapter
or of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (C)   If any part of this subchapter shall be found, in any action, suit or
proceeding, to be invalid or ineffective, the validity and the effect of the
remaining parts shall not be affected.

§ 34.02   PICK UP OF OHIO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM CONDITIONS.
   Effective with all wages earned during and after the first full pay period
after and following the date upon which the city is notified of the approval of
this “pick up” program by the Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio
(PERS), the city shall “pick up” the mandatory retirement contributions to the
Public Employees Retirement System for all Councilmembers eligible for and
electing to contribute to PERS, and for all full-time and part-time employee
positions of the city that are eligible for PERS, except the employment
positions that are subject to the current bargaining agreement between the city
and FOP Lodge Number 160, by using the salary reduction method illustrated in
Internal Revenue Service Re. Rul. 81-36, and shall designate such amounts as
employer contributions for income tax purposes in order that the amount of each
employee's income reported by the city as subject to federal and state income
tax shall be the employees' gross income reduced by the amount of the
employee's mandatory retirement system contribution which has been “picked up”
by the city, while continuing to designate such amounts as employee
contributions in order that the amount “picked up” by the city shall be
included in computing final average salary, as permitted by Ohio Attorney
General Opinion 82-097, and provided that the employee's total salary shall not
be increased by each “pick up” nor shall the city's total contribution to the
Public Employees retirement System be increased thereby.
(Ord. 93-18, passed 4-26-93)
§ 34.03   EARLY RETIREMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Employees of the city are eligible to consider an “early retirement”
option when the selection of that option will result in a cost savings to the
city. The early retirement period is defined as that period of time from which
the employee no longer engages in his or her physical duties and
responsibilities as a city employee and at the same time retains status as an
employee of the city for retirement purposes.
   (B)   A new leave category is established entitled “termination leave” which
provides for the equitable distribution and accounting of the employee's time
charges during the early retirement period. A temporary permanent position is
authorized for the purpose of hiring a new employee to fill the “early
retirement” position. The temporary permanent position terminates the date of

applies.
   (E)   Tax to be separately stated and charged.
      (1)   The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from

occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for. Such tax shall also be
stated separately upon every evidence of occupancy or any bill or statement or

shall be paid by the occupant to the operator as trustee for and on account of
the city, and the operator shall be liable to the city for the collection
thereof and for the tax.
      (2)   No operator of a hotel/motel/short-term rental shall advertise or
state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part
thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be

Finance for the purpose of collecting from transient guests the hotel/motel/
short–term rental tax and remitting the tax to the Director of Finance. This
certificate does not constitute a permit.”
   (G)   Records, inspection, destruction. Each operator shall keep complete
and accurate records of lodging furnished and of the tax collected thereon,
which shall be the amount due under this section, and shall keep all invoices
and such other pertinent documents. If the operator furnished lodging not
subject to the tax, the operator's records shall show the identity of the
transient guest, if the sale was not exempted by reason of such identity, or
shall show the nature of the transaction if exempted for any other reason. Such
records and other documents shall be open during business hours for inspection
by the Director of Finance, or his agents, and shall be preserved for a period
of four years, unless the Director of Finance, in writing, consents to their

delivering or mailing the same to the Director of Finance together with payment
of the full amount of tax shown to be due thereon.
      (2)   The Director of Finance may authorize operators whose tax liability
is not such as to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Director of
Finance upon the basis of administrative costs of the city, to make and file
returns at less frequent intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing,
shall indicate the intervals at which returns are to be filed, and may be
revoked by the Finance Director upon 30 days notice.

the operator during the reporting period shall be filed with the return.

      (5)   If for any reason the hotel/motel/short-term rental shall cease
doing business in the city, all returns and payments are due immediately upon
cessation of business.

payments to be made for other than monthly periods. The returns shall be signed
by the operator or his authorized agent.
   (I)   Penalties and interest.

imposed by this section within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to
10% of the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
      (2)   Continued delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any
delinquent remittances on or before a period of 30 days following the date on
which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency
penalty equal to 10% of the amount of the tax and previous penalty in addition
to the tax and the 10% penalty first imposed. An additional penalty equal to
10% of the total tax and penalty of the previous 30-day period shall be added
for each successive 30-day period the account remains delinquent.
      (3)   Fraud. If the Director of Finance determines that the nonpayment of
any remittance due under this section is due to fraud, a penalty equal to 25%
of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties
stated in subsections (1) and (2) of this division (I).
      (4)   Interest. In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any
operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this section shall pay interest

make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of
the tax or any portion thereof required by this section, the Director of
Finance shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and
information on which to base his estimate of the tax due.
      (2)   As soon as the Director of Finance shall procure such facts and
information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any
tax imposed by this section and payable by any operator who has failed or
refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he/she
shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest
and penalties provided for by this section. In case such determination is made,
the Director of Finance shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by
serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of
business.
      (3)   Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of
such notice make application in writing to the Director of Finance for a
hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is
not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any,
determined by the Director of Finance shall become final and conclusive and
immediately due and payable.
      (4)   If such application is made, the Director of Finance shall give not
less than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the
operator to show cause at a time and place fixed for such tax, interest and
penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such
specified tax, interest and penalties should not be fixed.
      (5)   After such hearing, the Director of Finance shall determine the
proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the
person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of

   (K)   Appeal. Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Director of
Finance with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any,
may appeal to the City Manager by filing a notice of appeal with him within 15
days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The City
Manager shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and shall give
notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of business. The
findings of the City Manager shall be final and conclusive and shall be served
upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of
hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon
the service of notice.
   (L)   Actions to collect. Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest
under the provisions of this section shall be deemed a debt owed by the
transient guest to the city. Any such tax collected by an operator which has
not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the
city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this section
shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery
of such amount.
   (M)   Violations. Any person violating any of the provisions of this section
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree and shall be fined not
more than $500 or imprisoned not more than 60 days, or both.

overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected
or received by the city under this section, it may be refunded as provided in
subsections (2) and (3) of this division (N), provided a claim in writing
therefore, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the
claim is founded, is filed with the Director of Finance within three years of
the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Director of
Finance.
      (2)   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Director of Finance that the person from whom the tax has
been collected was not a transient guest; provided, however, that neither a
refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected
has either been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent
subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.
      (3)   A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid
more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by
filing of a claim in the manner provided in subsection (1) of this division
(N), but only when the tax was paid by the transient guest directly to the
Director of Finance, or when the transient guest having paid the tax to the
operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the Director of Finance that the
transient guest has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who
collected the tax.
      (4)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.
   (O)   Moneys received, where credited. The moneys received under the
provisions of this section shall be credited to the general fund of the city.

investigation should be continued or the complaint be dismissed. The written
report shall be presented and discussed at an executive session of the Council
held during the first Council meeting subsequent to the completion of the
investigation.
   (D)   (1)   If, in public meeting immediately following the executive

right, and of the right of the City Manager, to be represented by counsel, to
examine evidence against him or her, to produce evidence, to call and subpoena
witnesses, to confront his or her accusers and to cross-examine witnesses.
   (E)   If the complaint is dismissed, the Council and City Manager shall make

evidence and other matters referred to in §
36.03(D) shall remain confidential, however, unless a respondent specifically

§ 37.01   JAILING OF PRISONERS.
   (A)   Authority. The City Manager is authorized and directed to enter into
such written contracts as he/she deems advisable in the best interest of this
city to provide for the confinement of prisoners of this city in jails
maintained by counties and/or other cities in the state.
   (B)   Payment. The City Manager is to provide for payment by the city of the
expenses of such confinement.
   (C)   Length of authority. The authority granted by this section shall
continue in effect, until repealed or modified by the City Council, so that the

§ 37.02   ESTABLISHMENT OF FEES AND SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   The City Manager is authorized and directed to establish current fees
for all city services and activities which have been recognized by City Council
through their annual budget process as fee-based services and activities. All
such fees shall be listed on a schedule that shall be dated and signed by the
City Manager and maintained in the Office of the City Manager, the Clerk of
Council, and the public office of the departments and/or divisions of the city
responsible for charging and collecting any such fees.
   (B)   City Council desires to achieve an equitable and fair mix for
financing city services in order to avoid subsidizing these services with
general tax revenue; thereby, allowing those general tax revenues to be used
for general services, including infrastructure maintenance and replacement. In
that regard, the City Manager is authorized and directed to give consideration
to the following elements in establishing the fee schedule:
      (1)   All applicable direct costs including, but not limited to,
salaries, wages, overtime, employee fringe benefits, services and supplies,
maintenance and operating expenses, contracted services, special supplies, and
any other direct expense incurred.

building maintenance and operations, equipment maintenance and operations,
communications expenses, computer costs, printing and reproduction, vehicle
expenses, insurance, and debt service.

assets, divided by the approximate life expectancy of the fixed asset.
      (4)   General overhead, such as the expenses of the City Council,
including the Clerk of Council, Department of Law, City Manager, Department of
Finance, Human Resources, and all other staff and support services provided to
the entire city organization.
   (C)   The City Manager may vary the fee schedule established under the
authority of this section if, in the judgment of the City Manager and a
directly affected and requesting department or division head, a gross inequity
would be perpetrated by not revising a fee or charge prior to the annual rate
review. Any such special rate review shall be reported to the City Council at
its next succeeding meeting where the City Council may revise the fee or charge
by ordinance.
   (D)   If fees or charges are not collected at the time that the service is
provided, the city has the right to pursue collection of any of the fees or
charges listed in this section, including certification to the County Auditor,
remittance to a collection service, or any other appropriate pursuit for
payment.

Council concerning and relating to the adoption of this section were adopted in
an open meeting of this Council, and that any and all deliberations of this

meetings open to the public, in compliance with all legal requirements,

§ 70.42   THROUGH HIGHWAYS.
   (A)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (B)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the city, if they have a continuous
length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or highway or
portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-control
signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or highways.
For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or portion
thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus of the
street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which vehicular
traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to traffic on
the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the city may by
ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion thereof, not to be a
through highway and thereafter the affected residence district shall be
indicated by official traffic- control devices. Where two or more through
highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-control signal
is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more
entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(R.C. § 4511.65)
§ 70.43   SIGNAL LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (A)   Steady green signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
is permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         (a)   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         (b)   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   (a)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (B)   Steady yellow signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)
(3) of this section.
         (b)   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (D)   Flashing green signal indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (E)   Flashing yellow signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (H)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

Penalty, see § 70.99
§ 70.44   TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNALS OVER REVERSIBLE LANES.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (A)   A steady downward green arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (B)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (D)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (E)   A steady red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

Penalty, see § 70.99
§ 70.45   PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (A)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (B)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (C)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (E)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

any highway any unauthorized sign, signal, marking, or device which purports to
be, is an imitation of, or resembles a traffic-control device or railroad sign
or signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from
view or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic-control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit, upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to highways of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic-
control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic-control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with R.C. §§ 4511.211 and
4511.432.
      (2)   Every prohibited sign, signal, marking, or device is a public
nuisance, and the authority having jurisdiction over the highway may remove the
same or cause it to be removed.
   (B)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed

restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.

certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (D)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.
   (E)   If the offender is sentenced under division (C)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's
driver license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in R.C. § 4510.02 (A)(7).

   (C)   (1)   No court shall impose an alternative sentence of house arrest
with electronic monitoring under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that
period.
   (D)   Fifty percent of any fine imposed by a court under division (B)(1),
(2), or (3) of this section shall be deposited into the municipal indigent
drivers alcohol treatment fund under the control of that court, as created by
the municipality pursuant to R.C. § 4511.191(H).
   (E)   In addition to or independent of all other penalties provided by law
or ordinance, the trial judge of any court of record or the mayor of a mayor’s
court shall impose on an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of this section a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s

limited driving privileges during a suspension imposed under this section, the
privileges shall be granted on the additional condition that the offender must
display restricted license plates, issued under R.C. § 4503.231, on the vehicle
driven subject to the privileges, except as provided in R.C. § 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver’s license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
R.C. § 3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from holding
a commercial driver’s license under R.C. § 4506.16 shall be issued a driver's
license under R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the commercial
driver’s license was suspended under this section, and no person whose
commercial driver’s license is suspended under this section shall be issued a
driver’s license under R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period of the suspension.
   (F)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to §
130.99(G) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic
loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate
result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after
committing the offense that is a misdemeanor of the first degree under this

or private property used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel or
parking in this municipality if the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s

violation of division (A) or (B) of this section may be admitted into evidence
as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under either a
financial responsibility law suspension at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A) of this section or a nonpayment of judgment suspension at the time
of the alleged violation of division (B) of this section. The person charged
with a violation of division (A) or (B) of this section may offer evidence to

2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously was
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section, or
any combination of two violations of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or
4510.16, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a
misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (3)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial

offender to respond to a financial responsibility random verification request
under R.C. § 4509.101(A)(3)(c) and that, at the time of the initial financial
responsibility random verification request, the alleged offender was in
compliance with division R.C. § 4509.101(A)(1) as shown by proof of financial

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §

the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left

immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic-control
device.
   (B)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         (a)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         (b)   When preparing for a left turn;
         (c)   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the
right-hand lane to continue on the driver’s intended route.
      (2)   Nothing in division (B)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (C)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic-control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or
except as permitted under division (A)(2) of this section. This division shall
not be construed as prohibiting the crossing of the center line in making a
left turn into or from an alley, private road, or driveway.
   (D)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,

overtaking and passing traffic proceeding in the same direction, unless the
left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient
distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be completely made
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every event, the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable, and

traffic approaching from the opposite direction, before coming within 200 feet
of any approaching vehicle.

at a safe distance, and shall not again drive to the right side of the roadway
until safely clear of the overtaken vehicle. When a motor vehicle overtakes and
passes a bicycle or electric bicycle, three feet or greater is considered a
safe passing distance.
      (2)   Except when overtaking and passing on the right is permitted, the
operator of an overtaken vehicle shall give way to the right in favor of the
overtaking vehicle at the latter’s audible signal, and the operator shall not
increase the speed of the operator’s vehicle until completely passed by the
overtaking vehicle.

and county boards of developmental disabilities, or child attending a program
offered by a head start agency who may have alighted therefrom has reached a
place of safety on the child’s or person’s residence side of the road.

the operator shall report the license plate number and general description of
the vehicle and of the operator of the vehicle to the law enforcement agency
exercising jurisdiction over the area where the alleged violation occurred. The
information contained in the report relating to the license plate number and to
the general description of the vehicle and the operator of the vehicle at the
time of the alleged violation may be supplied by any person with first-hand
knowledge of the information. Information of which the operator of the school
bus has first-hand knowledge also may be corroborated by any other person.
   (I)   Upon receipt of the report of the alleged violation of R.C. § 4511.75
(A) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the law enforcement
agency shall conduct an investigation to attempt to determine the identity of
the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. If the
identity of the operator at the time of the alleged violation is established,
the reporting of the license plate number of the vehicle shall establish
probable cause for the law enforcement agency to issue a citation for the
violation of R.C. § 4511.75(A) or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance. However, if the identity of the operator of the vehicle at the time
of the alleged violation cannot be established, the law enforcement agency
shall issue a warning to the owner of the vehicle at the time of the alleged
violation, except in the case of a leased or rented vehicle when the warning
shall be issued to the lessee at the time of the alleged violation.

thoroughfare for purposes of vehicular traffic, or block off any such portion
of a street or highway area, without first obtaining a permit from the Director
of the Police Department serving this city.
   (B)   A parade is defined to be a formal or informal march or procession of
two or more individuals, vehicles or animals moving from one point to another
in an organized manner so as to interfere with the free and uninterrupted use
by the public of such street or highway.
   (C)   Applications for such permits shall be made on such forms as may be
prescribed and shall contain such information as is reasonably necessary to a
fair determination of whether a permit should be issued, including but not
limited to the exact portions of any street or highway to be blocked off, the
exact route of the parade, the date and hours of the day for which the permit
is requested, the number of persons anticipated to be involved and the number,
type and size of vehicles and animals anticipated to be involved. Applications
shall be filed with the Director of the Police Department serving this city not
less than four days before the time intended for such parade, or blocking off.
   (D)   The permit shall be issued unless the Director finds that the
resultant conditions would unreasonably hinder the use by the public of such
portion of the street or highway or would require the diversion of sufficient
police officers or firefighters so as to deprive the city of normal police and
fire protection, in which case the application shall be rejected or conditions
imposed as set forth below.
   (E)   The permit or any order accompanying it may prescribe reasonable
conditions, including the hours, the places of assembly and of dispersal, the
route and manner of march or travel, the number, type and size of animals and
vehicles and the streets, highways or portions thereof which may be used or
occupied. In addition, the Director may require additional conditions for the
issuance of the permit, including but not limited to requirements and
restrictions that the person conducting the parade or blocking off the street
assume, in writing, the obligation of paying the costs to the city of
supervising and directing such parade or blocking off, including the cost of
providing personnel from the Police Department and Service Department serving
this city, or any other municipal corporation personnel, including the costs of
the services of outside contractors, and that such person provide evidence of
ability to pay such costs.
   (F)   The Director of the Police Department serving this city shall issue
the permit (with or without conditions) or a written rejection of the
application within four days after the application was filed. It shall be the
duty of the applicant to pick up the permit or rejection at the city offices.
   (G)   If the decision of the Director was to reject the application, or to
approve it but subject to conditions imposed by the Director, the city shall
take the initiative in providing for an administrative hearing and review
within five days after the rejection or conditional approval was issued. There
is created a Parade and Assembly Appeals Board to conduct such hearings and
review and to make determinations as authorized in this section. The members of
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall, for the purposes set forth herein,
constitute such Parade and Assembly Appeals Board.
      (1)   Notice. Notice of the hearing before such Board shall be given to
the applicant for the permit by telegram, night-letter or other form of
delivery of a written notice of the date, place and hour of the hearing.
      (2)   Decision. The Board shall reverse the decision of the Director and
shall grant the permit applied for, without conditions, unless it finds that
the rejection of the application, or the conditions imposed upon approval of
the application, were based upon a valid and correct determination by the
Director, supported by clear and convincing evidence presented to the Board,
that resulting conditions would have unreasonably hindered use by the public of
such street or highway or would have required the diversion of police or fire
personnel so as to deprive the city of its normal protection. The decision of
the Board shall be made and issued at a public meeting of that body held not
later than three days after the administrative review hearing referred to
above.
      (3)   Judicial appeal. Decisions of this Board shall constitute final
administrative decisions so as to be subject to judicial review under R.C.
Chapter 2506 upon appeal to the court system by the applicant for such a
permit, and the applicant may combine such an appeal with a request for
immediate restraining order and/or injunctive relief as authorized by the Ohio
Rules of Civil Procedure. The applicant shall be informed of this right of
judicial review.

properly restrained either in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
in a child restraint system that meets federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in R.C. § 4513.263.
   (E)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of division (C) or (D) of this section has been
or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of division (C) or (D) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of division
(C) or (D) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a law

to carry out this section.
   (G)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a

required in this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the
motor vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.

the life of any person operating or occupying a motor vehicle that is being
used to transport a child who otherwise would be required to be restrained
under this section. This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
state under R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in this
state under R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who otherwise would be
required to be restrained under this section has a physical impairment that
makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat, or an occupant restraining
device impossible or impractical, provided that the person operating the
vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in accordance with
any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted on the affidavit.
   (I)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation, or summons issued for violating this section.
   (J)   (1)   Whoever violates division (A), (B), (C), or (D) of this section
shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a
motor vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system,
booster seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that
occurred at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed
to be a single violation of this section:
         (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (J)(1)(b) of this
section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than $25 nor more than $75.
         (b)   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a violation of division (A), (B), (C), or (D) of this section or of a
state law or municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent any of those
divisions, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (E)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.

2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) or
(B) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         (c)   Division (D)(4)(b) of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by

prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)
(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (D)(1)(b) of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under §
73.04, shall state that the person may have an independent test performed at
the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical
test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the
chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   (a)   As used in division (D)(4)(b) and (c) of this section,

abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:

court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (D)(4)(b) of this section.

of evidence, a report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

      (5)   (a)   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (d),
or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled

refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (C) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (A)(3) and (A)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         (b)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (A)(5)(a) of this section, the law enforcement
officer who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the arresting
law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this section to

73.02, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance. The officer shall
give that advice in a written form that contains the information described in
division (C) of this section and shall read the advice to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest
and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or more persons shall
witness the arresting officer’s reading of the form, and the witnesses shall
certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the
chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer,
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does
not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to
submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form
to the person:
      “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
      “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state OVI, and, if
you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
      “(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
      “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it
to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the
arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is
not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of §
73.02, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
person submits to the test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting officer
shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (C) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (E)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of §
73.02, R.C. §4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is
asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under
this section, and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that
the test results indicate is present in the person’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (G)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197 relative to any
suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the
report.
(R.C. § 4511.192)

license or permit or nonresident operating privilege under this section for the
time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) is effective immediately from the
time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension upon the
arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the
charge that resulted in the person’s being requested to take the chemical test
or tests under division (A) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §
73.02 or R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
regardless of whether the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. §
4511.191(B) or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the
charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons’
arrest or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any
continuance granted by the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the
issues specified in that section.

to the proposed location of a new wireless support structure, provided the
alternate location is within 100 feet or a distance equal to the width of the
right-of-way in or on which the new wireless support structure is proposed,
whichever is greater. The city also finds that certain locations and
collocation configurations are preferred. A preferred location and collocation
configuration should be utilized whenever possible and should only be surpassed
if in the determination of the City Engineer, or designee, clear and convincing
evidence supports such a decision. Cost alone should not be grounds for such a
determination. The order of preference is as follows:
            1.   First, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no
such pole or wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next
preference;
            2.   Second, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within an alley. If no such pole or
wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
            3.   Third, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            4.   Fourth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within an alley. If no such location is available
then proceed to the next preference;
            5.   Fifth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a
wireless support structure currently supporting a small cell facility located
within the city right-of-way. If no such wireless support structure is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            6.   Sixth, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole located within the city right-of-way. If no such existing pole is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            7.   Ninth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within the city right-of-way.
         (b)   Any new wireless support structure shall be located at least 200
feet from any existing small cell facility.
      (3)   Wireless facilities design. Wireless support structures, wireless
facilities, and small cell facilities shall be subject to the following design
standards:
         (a)   New wireless support structures shall be limited to 40 feet in
height unless: (i) the area is within 300 feet of the proposed site for a new
wireless support structure in the same public way or a connecting public way,
and there are no wireless support structure or utility poles taller than 30
feet in height above ground level; or (ii) the maximum allowable height for
building construction in the underlying zoning district is 35 feet in height
above ground level or less. If (i) or (ii) of this section apply, then new
wireless support structure shall be limited to 35 feet in height;
         (b)   Wireless support structures shall be capable of supporting at
least two small cell facility operators.
         (c)   Wireless facilities design.
            1.   The City Engineer, or designee, is vested with the authority

request.
            3.   Wireless support structures shall be subject to the following
design standards, unless such standards conflict with the design standards set
forth by the City Engineer as set forth above. In the event there is a
conflict, the design standards set forth by the City Engineer shall control:
               a.   New wireless support structures shall be limited to 40 feet
in height, unless: (i) the area is within 300 feet of the proposed site for a
new wireless support structure in the same public way or a connecting public
way, and there are no wireless support structure or utility poles taller than
30 feet in height above ground level; or (ii) the maximum allowable height for
building construction in the underlying zoning district is 35 feet in height
above ground level or less. If (i) or (ii) of this section apply, then new
wireless support structure shall be limited to 35 feet in height;
               b.   Wireless support structures shall be capable of supporting
at least two small cell facility operators;
               c.   As determined by the City Engineer or designee, wireless
support structures design shall be consistent with the design features of
nearby poles, including but not limited to consistent style, material, color,
and the design features of the existing or proposed streetscape, district, or
site and in furtherance of the maintaining the historical context of a district
or specific site understanding that in some instances, there is a desire to
camouflage or conceal the pole from view.
   (O)   Reservation of right-of-way. The city reserves the right to reserve
space for future public safety or transportation uses in the right-of-way or on
a wireless support structure or pole owned or operated by the city in a
documented and approved plan in place at the time an application is filed. A
reservation of space shall not preclude placement of a pole or collocation of a
small cell facility. If replacement of the city's pole or wireless support
structure is necessary to accommodate the collocation of the small cell
facility and the future use, the small cell facility operator shall pay for the
replacement of the pole or wireless support structure, and the replaced pole or
wireless support structure must accommodate the future use.
   (P)   Nonconformities. A nonconforming small cell facility and/or wireless
support structure shall immediately lose its nonconforming designation and must
be brought into compliance with all of the provisions of this section, and all
other applicable city laws and ordinances or be removed if any of the following

structure is damaged or deteriorated and requires any process of
reconstruction, repair, maintenance, or restoration, and the cost of said
reconstruction, repair, maintenance, or restoration exceeds 50% of the small
cell facility and/or wireless support structure's replacement cost;
      (3)   The nonconforming small cell facility and/or wireless support
structure is abandoned.
   (Q)   Conflicts with other provisions. In the event that any other
applicable law or code requires any more restrictive requirements, the most
restrictive requirement shall control.
   (R)   Severability. The provisions of any part of this section are
severable. If any provision or subsection, or the application of any provision
or subsection to any person or circumstances, is held invalid, the remaining
provisions, subsection, and applications of such ordinance to other persons or
circumstances shall not be made invalid as well. It is declared to be the
intent of this section that the remaining provisions would have been adopted
had such invalid provisions not been included in this section when originally
adopted by Council.
   (S)   Penalties.
      (1)   Any person in violation of any of the terms of this section, or
who, being the owner or agent of the owner of any lot, tract, or parcel of

or low-alcohol beverage presented a driver’s or commercial driver’s license or

implemented and that is intended to prevent violations of R.C. §§ 4301.22(A)(1)

equivalent municipal ordinances. For purposes of division (A)(3) of this
section, the Commission or trier of fact shall consider that reasonable
reliance upon the identification presented and the completed transaction scan
may require a permit holder or an agent or employee of a permit holder to
exercise reasonable diligence to determine, and that the use of a transaction
scan device does not excuse a permit holder or an agent or employee of a permit
holder from exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:
      (1)   Whether a person to whom the permit holder or agent or employee of
a permit holder sells any beer or intoxicating liquor is 21 years of age or

equivalent municipal ordinance.

criminal action in which the affirmative defense provided by division (A) of

      (2)   Notwithstanding division (1)(a) of this definition, in no case
shall the portion of the definition of the term PERSON that is set forth in
division (1)(a)2. of this definition be applied or construed in any section
contained in Title XIII of this code that sets forth a criminal offense in any
of the following manners:
         (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (2)(a) of this
definition, in a manner so that the offense prohibits or is construed as
prohibiting any pregnant woman or her physician from performing an abortion
with the consent of the pregnant woman, with the consent of the pregnant woman
implied by law in a medical emergency, or with the approval of one otherwise
authorized by law to consent to medical treatment on behalf of the pregnant
woman. An abortion that violates the conditions described in the immediately

of the type otherwise adequate to permit medical treatment to the pregnant
woman, even if it does not comply with R.C. § 2919.12.
         (b)   In a manner so that the offense is applied or is construed as
applying to a woman based on an act or omission of the woman that occurs while
she is or was pregnant and that results in any of the following:

city if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this city, any
element of which takes place in this city.
      (2)   While in this city, the person attempts to commit, or is guilty of
complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction, which
offense is an offense under both the laws of this city and the other
jurisdiction, or, while in this city, the person conspires to commit an offense
in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under both the laws of
this city and the other jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in
furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this city by the person or
another person involved in the conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance
into the conspiracy. In any case in which a person attempts to commit, is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in
another jurisdiction as described in this division, the person is subject to
criminal prosecution and punishment in this city for the attempt, complicity,
or conspiracy, and for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in
the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this city, the person conspires or attempts to commit,
or is guilty of complicity in the commission of an offense in this city.
      (4)   While out of this city, the person omits to perform a legal duty
imposed by the laws of this city, which omission affects a legitimate interest
of the city in protecting, governing or regulating any person, property, thing,
transaction or activity in this city.
      (5)   While out of this city, the person unlawfully takes or retains
property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or retained
property into this city.

another and subsequently brings the other person into this city.

municipality in violation of the law of this state or municipality.
   (B)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (A)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes

under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this city need not
be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by another
person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (G)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this city the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this city.

offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two

      (2)   As used in this division:
         (a)   The phrase OFFENSE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE MISCONDUCT IN
OFFICE OF A PUBLIC SERVANT includes, but is not limited to, a violation of R.C.

of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (K)   As used in this section, PEACE OFFICER has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 2935.01.

applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.

§ 130.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      CULPABILITY. Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as defined
in §
130.08.
      INTOXICATION. Includes, but is not limited to, intoxication resulting
from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      POSSESSION. A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21)
§ 130.08   CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22)
§ 130.09   ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
(R.C. § 2923.02)
Penalty, see § 130.99
Statutory reference:
   Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
   Solid and hazardous wastes, see R.C. Chapter 3734
§ 130.10   COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of §
130.09.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(R.C. § 2923.03)
Penalty, see § 130.99
Statutory reference:
   Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
§ 130.11   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23)
§ 130.12   PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in §
130.11, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24)
§ 130.13 SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (C)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
§ 130.99   GENERAL PENALTY FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically classified within the body of the
section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section shall be deemed
a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than $500,
imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) to (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
133.99 of this Code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §§
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(5)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(5)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(5)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) or
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §§
130.99 or
133.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (D)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term of up to 60 days in a community alternative sentencing center
or district community alternative sentencing center established and operated in
accordance with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section,
with one of the conditions of the sanction being that the offender complete in

travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned

applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a

division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing

the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;

requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to

vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;

is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (G) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (G), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (G) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               A.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               B.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               C.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s general fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the
treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s general fund in accordance with
division (G)(8) of this section. The municipal corporation shall use the
amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs incurred by the municipal
corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of
this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a
sanction imposed under division (E) of this section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor domestic
violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than $70 nor
more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (G)(4)(b) and (G)
(4)(c) of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be credited
to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         (b)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         (c)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.A. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.B.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         (b)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.11 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;
         (e)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $1,000;
         (f)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

§ 131.08   DESECRATION. (REPEALED)
Editor's note:
   This section was repealed as part of the 1996 updating to the Code of
Ordinances because certain provisions of the state desecration statute (Ohio
R.C. 2927.11) are unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the United
States Constitution. See United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990); Texas
v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989).

Penalty, see § 130.99
§ 131.10   DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (A)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of R.C. § 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (B)   (1)   When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716,14(A), R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or
2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. § 2913.31 or 2913.43 involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a
series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts
to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations
of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service
member or spouse of an active duty service member, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. The value of
the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §
2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more than one
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant
to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a
single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the
property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all of the offenses in
the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2) or
(B)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (B)
(1) or (B)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (B)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, FAIR
MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender previously has been convicted of a theft offense, a violation of §

Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(F). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than

described in those divisions or as limiting the definition of “privilege” set
forth in R.C. § 2901.01.

an offense of violence.
   (C)   No person who discovers the body or acquires the first knowledge of
the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the
death is believed to have occurred, or knowledge concerning the death is
obtained. For purposes of this division, “advanced practice registered nurse”
does not include a certified registered nurse anesthetist.

who, outside a hospital, sanitarium, or other medical facility, attends or
treats a person who has sustained a burn injury inflicted by an explosion or
other incendiary device, or that shows evidence of having been inflicted in a
violent, malicious, or criminal manner, shall fail to report the burn injury

§ 3113.31, shall note that knowledge or belief and the basis for it in the
patient’s or client’s records.
      (2)   Notwithstanding R.C. § 4731.22, the physician-patient privilege or
advanced practice registered nurse-patient privilege shall not be a ground for
excluding any information regarding the report containing the knowledge or
belief noted under division (F)(1) of this section, and the information may be
admitted as evidence in accordance with the Rules of Evidence.

source, privileged under R.C. §§ 2739.04 or 2739.12.

the clergy.

person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting attorney, to
have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst present at an
analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are, the basis of the
alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to receive copies of all

present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis of the
alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further written
request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the
measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at
conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number of
unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance
contained any amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01   STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City
Council of City of Beavercreek, State of Ohio, does ordain the following
chapter.
(Ord. 22-06, passed 2-28-22)
§ 151.02   FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Beavercreek has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage, also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 22-06, passed 2-28-22)
§ 151.03   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood-prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 22-06, passed 2-28-22)
§ 151.04   METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 22-06, passed 2-28-22)
§ 151.05    LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the city as identified in §
151.06, including any future areas of special flood hazard annexed by the city.
(Ord. 22-06, passed 2-28-22)
§ 151.06   BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (A)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study, Greene County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas,
Effective March 8, 2022.
      (2)   Flood Insurance Rate Map, Greene County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas, Effective March 8, 2022.
      (3)   Any and all subsequent revisions by FEMA of the above referenced
panels and study.
      (4)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio that has been approved by
the City of Beavercreek, Ohio including, but not limited to those required by §
151.43 Subdivisions and Other New Developments.
      (5)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
   (B)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at Beavercreek City Hall, 1368 Research Park Drive,
Beavercreek, Ohio.
(Ord. 22-06, passed 2-28-22)
§ 151.07   ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations are not intended to repeal,
abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions.
However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed
restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restriction shall prevail.
(Ord. 22-06, passed 2-28-22)
§ 151.08    INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 22-06, passed 2-28-22)
§ 151.09   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 22-06, passed 2-28-22)
§ 151.10   DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to the principal structure.
   APPEAL. A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year. The BASE FLOOD may also be referred to as the 1% chance annual
flood or 100-year flood.
   BASE (100-YEAR) FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The water surface elevation of the
base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in feet mean sea level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from one
to three feet).
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ENCLOSURE BELOW THE LOWEST FLOOR. See LOWEST FLOOR as defined in this
section.
   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT). Issued by President Carter in
1977, this order requires that no federally-assisted activities be conducted in
or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless
there is no practicable alternative.
   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA). The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   FILL. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community, depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
in any given year; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE. Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood in any given year; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
in any given year; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow
on sloping terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
in any given year; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of
ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded). Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded). Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the
base flood elevation plus two feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood
elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation
can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or
approved by the floodplain administrator.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
FLOODWAY is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, an LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A comment by FEMA
regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the
hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in
the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood
elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does not amend or revise
effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, or flood
insurance studies.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle. For the purposes of
these regulations, a MANUFACTURED HOME includes manufactured homes and mobile
homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 4781.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in O.A.C. 4781-12-01(K), any tract of
land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are
parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any
roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as
part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the
individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the
purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked
thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK does not include any tract of land used solely for the
storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The NFIP is a federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the “start of construction” commenced
on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by the City
of Beavercreek and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the “start of
construction” commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM,
August 2, 1982 or after December 31, 197 4, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   PERSON. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An AGENCY is further defined in R.C. § 111.15(A)(2)
as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to,
any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. AGENCY does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is: (1) built on a single chassis; (2)
400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; (3)
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
(4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT. A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture under the provisions of R.C. §§ 4703.01 through
4703.19.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person registered as a professional
engineer under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a professional
surveyor under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Also known as “areas of special flood hazard”, it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in
any given year. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance
Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as
Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS may also refer
to areas that are flood-prone and designated from other federal, state or local
sources of data, including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood-prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the zoning permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. PERMANENT
CONSTRUCTION does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial damage also means flood related damage sustained by a structure on
two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial
damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local Zoning, health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified prior to the application to the local
Code Enforcement Official for a development permit and which are the minimum
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to division (A)(1) of
this section.
   (B)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the City Manager, and may be
submitted at any time.
   (C)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the city have been
modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or
no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations
for a particular area. In order that the Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately
represent the city boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map
of the city suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits

§ 151.31 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (A)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA-identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (B)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in §§
151.60 through
151.65, Appeals and Variances.
   (D)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.

      (1)   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from the
preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall reasonably be utilized as best available
data.
      (2)   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a letter of final determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
   (B)   Zones AE, A1-30, AH, and AO:
      (1)   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
         (a)   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
         (b)   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not be
used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or until
all appeals have been resolved.
      (2)   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of §
151.49(B) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the best
data available.
   (C)   Zones B, C, and X: Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary
FIRM or FIS are not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the
effective FIRM which are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, or AO.

event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
   (B)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

§ 151.49 ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood-carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (A)   Development in floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         (a)   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
151.30(A);
         (b)   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         (c)   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         (d)   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         (e)   Concurrence of the City Manager and the Chief Executive Officer
of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (B)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
       (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation, may
be permitted, provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         (a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         (b)   Divisions (A)(2)(a) and (A)(2)(c) through (e) of this section.
   (C)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of bankfull stage shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
city, specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in §
151.30(A)(1)(c) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

(Ord. 22-06, passed 2-28-22)
§ 151.63 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The BZA shall have the power to authorize, in specific cases, such
variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent with
federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (A)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought, shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the BZA.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   Any other information deemed necessary by the Floodplain
Administrator in order to make a determination regarding the variance
application.
      (4)   A fee, as set in the Planning Department fee schedule as adopted by
the city, shall be paid upon the submittal of an application for a variance or
appeal to the BZA.
   (B)   Public hearing.
      (1)   The appellant shall present such statements and evidence as the BZA
requires at the standard public hearing portion of the BZA meeting. In
considering such variance applications, the BZA shall consider and make
findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards
specified in other sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         (e)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         (f)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         (k)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         (d)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         (e)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the BZA may attach such conditions to the granting of variances,
as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (C)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing the provisions of division (B)(1)(a)
through (k) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one- half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 22-06, passed 2-28-22)
§ 151.64 PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   Standard procedures per the City of Beavercreek Zoning Code shall be

BZA and subsequent appeal to the Beavercreek City Council, may appeal such
decision of the City Council within ten days to the Greene County Court of
Common Pleas, as provided in R.C. Chapter 2506.

residential and nonresidential structures and all existing premises and
constitute minimum requirements and standards for premises, structures,
equipment and facilities for light, ventilation, space, heating, sanitation,
protection from the elements, life safety, safety from fire and other hazards,
and for safe and sanitary maintenance; the responsibility of owners, operators
and occupants; the occupancy of existing structures and premises, and for
administration, enforcement and penalties.
   (C)   Intent. This code shall be construed to secure its expressed intent,
which is to ensure public health, safety and welfare insofar as they are
affected by the continued occupancy and maintenance of structures and premises.
Existing structures and premises that do not comply with these provisions shall
be altered or repaired to provide a minimum level of health and safety as
required herein.
   (D)   Severability. If a section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of
this code is, for any reason, held to be unconstitutional, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this code.
(Ord. 15-08, passed 6-8-15)
§ 153.02 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   General. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a
specific requirement, the specific requirement shall govern. Where differences
occur between provisions of this code and the referenced standards, the
provisions of this code shall apply. Where, in a specific case, different
sections of this code specify different requirements, the most restrictive
shall govern.
   (B)   Maintenance. Equipment, systems, devices and safeguards required by
this code or a previous regulation or code under which the structure or
premises was constructed, altered or repaired shall be maintained in good
working order. No owner, operator or occupant shall cause any service,
facility, equipment or utility which is required under this section to be
removed from or shut off from or discontinued for any occupied dwelling, except
for such temporary interruption as necessary while repairs or alterations are
in progress. The requirements of this code are not intended to provide the
basis for removal or abrogation of fire protection and safety systems and
devices in existing structures. Except as otherwise specified herein, the owner
or the owner's designated agent shall be responsible for the maintenance of
buildings, structures and premises.
   (C)   Application of other codes. Repairs, additions or alterations to a
structure, or changes of occupancy, shall be done in accordance with the
procedures and provisions of the Beavercreek Zoning Code, Ohio Building Code,

Code of Ohio for One-, Two-, and Three-Family Dwellings, Ohio Plumbing Code and
NFPA 70.

relating to the removal or demolition of any structure which is dangerous,
unsafe and insanitary.

which are caused directly or indirectly by the enforcement of this code shall

this code shall be considered part of the requirements of this code to the
prescribed extent of each such reference and as further regulated in divisions
(G)(1) and (G)(2) of this section. Where enforcement of a code provision would
violate the conditions of the listing of the equipment or appliance, the
conditions of the listing shall apply.

the reference to a referenced code or standard includes subject matter that is
within the scope of this code, the provisions of this code, as applicable,
shall take precedence over the provisions in the referenced code or standard.
   (H)   Requirements not covered by code. Requirements necessary for the
strength, stability or proper operation of an existing fixture, structure or
equipment, or for the public safety, health and general welfare, not
specifically covered by this code, shall be determined by the code official.
   (I)   Application of references. References to chapter or section numbers,
or to provisions not specifically identified by number, shall be construed to
refer to such chapter, section or provision of this code.

dangerous to the life, health, property or safety of the public or the
occupants of the structure by not providing minimum safeguards to protect or
warn occupants in the event of fire, or because such structure contains unsafe
equipment or is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe or of
such faulty construction or unstable foundation, that partial or complete
collapse is possible.

edition), or any other measures that are approved by the City Engineer.
   (D)   Stream and wetland riparian buffers.
      (1)   The site owner and/or applicant shall leave an undisturbed riparian
buffer on both sides of and/or surrounding water resources, except for
crossings and other riparian area and wetland impacts approved by the City
Engineer. Buffer width will be determined on a case-by-case, using criteria
such as floodplain, topography, vegetative cover, canopy cover, and soil types
and the like.
      (2)   The site owner or applicant shall be responsible for obtaining a
determination of 404 permit applicability by the Corps of Engineers prior to
application for permit.
   (E)   Channel protection. To protect stream channels from degradation, a
specific channel protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the
latest edition of Rainwater and Land Development and as included in the SWP3.
   (F)   Temporary stabilization of disturbed areas and soil stockpiles.
      (1)   A temporary vegetative cover shall be applied to disturbed areas as
specified in Table 1 below:
 
Table 1

surface water of the state              coverage for the individual lot(s)
Disturbed areas that will be idle over  Prior to onset of winter weather
winter
 
      (2)   Application practices include vegetative establishment, mulching
and the early application of gravel base on areas to be paved. Soil
stabilization measures should be appropriate for the time of year, site
conditions and estimated time of use.
      (3)   Topsoil removed shall be stored on site and shall be stabilized
with quick growing plants or other means, so that it is protected from wind and
water erosion. Topsoil shall be maintained in a useable condition for
sustaining vegetation and reused on the site.
   (G)   Permanent stabilization.
      (1)   A permanent vegetative cover shall be placed on disturbed areas as
specified in Table 2 below.
 
Table 2
Permanent Stabilization
Area Required Permanent Stabilization  Time Frame to Apply Erosion Controls
Any area that will lie dormant for one Within seven working days of the most
year or more                           recent disturbance
Any areas within 50 feet of a surface  With two working days after reaching

Other areas at final grade             Within seven working days of reaching
                                       final grade within that area
 
      (2)   Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until a
ground cover is achieved which is mature enough to control soil erosion and
will survive severe weather conditions.
   (H)   Cut and fill slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed,
constructed and stabilized in a manner which will minimize erosion.
Consideration should be given to the length and steepness of the slope, the
soil type, upslope drainage area, ground water conditions and other applicable
factors. If, after final grading, excessive erosion takes place, additional
slope stabilizing measures by the owner, developer or builder will be required
until the problem is corrected. The following guidelines are provided to aid in
developing an adequate design:
      (1)   Roughened soil surfaces are generally preferred to smooth surfaces
on slopes.
      (2)   Diversions should be constructed at the top of long, steep slopes
which have significant drainage areas above the slope. Diversions or terraces
may also be used to reduce slope length.
      (3)   Concentrated storm water should not be allowed to flow down cut or
fill slopes unless contained within an adequate channel, flume or slope drain
structure.
      (4)   Wherever a slope face crosses a water seepage plane which endangers
the stability of the slope, adequate drainage or other protection should be
provided.
   (I)   Protection of adjacent properties/public right-of-ways. Properties,
public right-of-ways and thoroughfares adjacent to the site of an earth-
disturbing activity shall be protected from sediment deposit. This may be
accomplished by preserving a well-vegetated buffer at the perimeter of the
site, by installing perimeter controls such as sediment barriers, filters,
dikes, sediment basins, or by a combination of such measures.
   (J)   Sediment control structures.
      (1)   Sediment control structures shall be used to control erosion and
trap sediment on a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days. Such
structures may include, but are not limited to, silt fences, storm drain inlet
protection, sediment basins and diversions or channels which direct runoff to a
sediment basin. All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding
runoff in order to be considered functional.
      (2)   Sediment control structures shall be constructed as a first step in
grading and be made functional before upslope earth-disturbing activities take
place. Earthen structures such as dams, dikes, and diversions shall be seeded
and mulched as soon as the installation is complete. Sediment control
structures shall be functional throughout the course if earth-disturbing
activity and until the site is stabilized with permanent vegetation.
      (3)   Sheet flow runoff from the site shall be intercepted by silt fence
or diversions. Silt fence shall be placed on a level contour and shall be
capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The relationship between the maximum
drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is shown in Table 3
below.
 
Table 3
Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence
Maximum drainage area (in acres) to 100 Range of slope for a particular
linear feet of silt fence               drainage area (percent)
0.5                                     <2%
0.25                                    ≥ 2% but < 20%
0.125                                   ≥ 20% but < 50%
 
      (4)   Storm water diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten acres.
      (5)   Whenever storm water detention is required the storm water runoff
from the site shall pass through a sediment basin or other suitable sediment-
trapping facility before discharge to a receiving water body. The authorized
agent(s) may require sediment basins or traps for smaller disturbed areas where
deemed necessary.
   (K)   Stabilization of waterways and outlets. All on-site storm water
conveyance channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow without erosion. Methods adequate to prevent erosion shall
also be provided at the outlets of all pipes and paved channels.
   (L)   Storm sewer inlet protection. All storm sewer inlets shall be
protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter the conveyance system
without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove sediment.
   (M)   Working in or crossing watercourses.
      (1)   All activities shall be kept out of watercourses to the extent
possible. Where in-channel work is necessary, precautions shall be taken to
stabilize the work area during construction to minimize erosion. The channel,
including bed and banks, shall be restored to its original cross-section and
all disturbed area stabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed.
      (2)   Where a watercourse will be crossed regularly during construction,
a temporary stream crossing shall be provided, used for the shortest period
practical, removed following site construction, and restored as described in
division (M)(1) of this section.
   (N)   Maintenance and removal of temporary measures.
      (1)   All temporary erosion and sediment control practices shall be
maintained and repaired to assure continued performance.
      (2)   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be
removed within 30 days after final stabilization is achieved or after the
temporary measures are no longer needed. Trapped sediment and other disturbed
soil areas resulting from the removal of temporary measures shall have the
final grade re-established and be permanently stabilized to prevent further
erosion and sedimentation.
   (O)   Control of construction site debris and wastes. All owners,
applicants, contractors and developers shall control wastes such as discarded
building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter and sanitary
waste on construction sites, and shall keep streets and gutters clear of all
sediment and debris from the site.
   (P)   Use, safety and maintenance of storm water practices.
      (1)   Storm water management practices shall be designed for the ultimate
use of the site and function safely and with minimal maintenance.
      (2)   If an inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of
repair or maintenance, with the exception of a sediment settling pond, it must
be repaired or maintained within three days of the inspection and the receipt
of notice. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten
days of the inspection and receipt of notice.
      (3)   If an inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform
its intended function and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 shall be amended and the new control practice shall be
installed within ten days of the inspection.
      (4)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice has not been
implemented in accordance with the schedule contained in the approved SWP3, the
control practice shall be implemented within ten days from the date of the
inspection. If the inspection reveals that the planned control practice is not
needed, the record shall contain a statement of explanation as to why the
control practice is not needed.
   (Q)   Inspection of storm water controls.
      (1)   All on-site control practices shall be periodically inspected to
ensure proper function and to identify failures.
      (2)   On and off-site discharge locations shall be inspected to ascertain
whether erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing
significant impacts to the receiving waters.
      (3)   See §
154.07(G) for specific requirements.
   (R)   Accessibility and easements.
      (1)   All permanent storm water management measures may be required to be
contained within easements as determined by the City Engineer. If an easement
is required, then the easement shall be sufficient to cover the facility and to
provide access for inspection and maintenance.
      (2)   See §
154.07(H) for specific requirements.
   (S)   Status of standards. The standards identified in this section are
general guidelines. Each application shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis
and some may require additional and more stringent requirements, while others
may have individual requirements waived by the authorized agent.

   (C)   Consistency with the city plans, policies and programs. All land
dedications and/or fees in-lieu of dedication required by this section shall
substantially conform to the official City of Beavercreek Parks, Recreation and
Culture Master Plan and other applicable city plans, policies and programs;
where discrepancies exist, the determination of the Parks Director and Planning
and Development Director shall govern.
   (D)   Choice of land dedication or fee-in-lieu.
      (1)   Planning Commission determination. Upon the advice of the Parks,
Recreation and Culture Board, Parks Director and Planning and Development
Director, the Planning Commission shall determine whether the developer shall
dedicate land, pay a fee-in-lieu of dedication, or provide a combination of
dedication and fee payment.
      (2)   Procedure. In making the determination referred to in division (D)
(1) above, the following procedure shall apply.
         (a)   At the time of official submission of the initial development
plan for the property, the developer shall submit the plan to the Parks,
Recreation and Culture Board for preliminary feedback.
         (b)   At the time of filing the initial development plan for the
property (specific site plan, detailed site plan, or preliminary subdivision
plan, whichever is earlier), the developer shall, as a part of such filing,
indicate whether the requirements of this section will be met by land
dedication, fees in-lieu-of dedication, or a combination thereof. If the
developer intends to dedicate land, such land shall be indicated on the
development plan.
         (c)   Planning Commission determination regarding land dedication,
fees, or a combination thereof, shall be made during the review of the initial
development plan for the property. Insofar as practicable, the determination of
the Planning Commission shall be compatible with the Parks, Recreation and
Culture Master Plan.
      (3)   Criteria. In making the determination referred to in division (D)
(1) above, the following criteria shall be considered:
         (a)   Suitability of soils and geology for the proposed use;
         (b)   Suitability of topography and drainage for the proposed use,
with no more than 40% of the dedicated land comprised of environmentally
sensitive areas and no more than 50% of the dry ground exceeding 3% grade or
the remaining dry ground exceeding 5% grade, unless the Planning Commission
determines that such areas would be of unique natural or environmental value
for future subdivision residents;
         (c)   Location and impact of federally designated floodways and
floodway fringe areas relative to the proposed use;
         (d)   Extent of natural vegetation and tree cover, with priority given
to the preservation of wooded areas and other natural features of scenic beauty
which will add attractiveness and value to the dedicated land;
         (e)   The adequacy of the location of the dedicated land within the
subdivision relative to its centrality and proximity to residents;
         (f)   The adequacy of the configuration of each proposed area, with
preference given to one contiguous parcel sufficiently geometric to be usable
for active and/or passive recreational pursuits; and
         (g)   The degree and quality of vehicular and non-vehicular access
provided to the public and for maintenance purposes.
      (4)   Minimum dedication. A fee-in-lieu of dedication shall be paid, and
no dedication of land shall be required, in the event the amount of dedication
required by this section would comprise less than one acre, except in the event
the land so dedicated could be added to the adjoining, contiguous land area of
an existing park or recreational facility.
      (5)   Quality of land to be dedicated. A fee-in-lieu-of land dedication
shall be paid when the Planning Commission, upon the advice of the Parks,
Recreation and Culture Board, determines no land shall be required to be
dedicated and/or the land proposed to be dedicated to be unsuitable in
location, topography, environmental characteristics and/or development
potential as related to the intended use.
   (E)   Dedication of land.
      (1)   Intent. The primary intent of this division is to provide land to
serve local or neighborhood recreational needs, including but not limited to
facilities such as tot lots, play lots, playgrounds, neighborhood parks,
playfields, community parks, and other specialized recreational facilities
which may serve citizens of all ages.
      (2)   Amount of land to be dedicated. The amount of land to be dedicated
by a developer pursuant to this section shall be determined by the following
formula:
         (a)   The maximum number of dwelling units permitted by the zoning
approval; multiplied by:
            1.   The average number ofresidents per relevant dwelling unit type
(single-family, multi-family, mobile home) within the city as determined by the
most recent available American Community Survey published by the US Census
Bureau; multiplied by,
            2.   Twelve and half thousandths of an acre (0.0125 acre) per
person, which shall be increased to fifteen thousandths of an acre (0.015 acre)
per person two years after passage of Ordinance 22-17.
            3.   Consideration of demographic study. In the event such figures
are disputed, a developer or subdivider may submit a demographic study,
conducted at their expense, showing the estimated population to be generated
from the subdivision for consideration by the Planning Commission, which may
choose to reduce estimated population at their discretion.
            4.   Location of land to be dedicated. Upon the advice of the
Parks, Recreation and Culture Board and/or Parks Director, the Planning
Commission shall determine the final location of the park land to be dedicated.
The park shall be located to primarily benefit the future residents of the
subdivision.
            5.   Procedure. Dedication of park land shall occur at the final
subdivision approval stage or as may be otherwise required by the Planning
Commission. The dedication of land required by this division shall be by a
general warranty deed conveying to the city and its successors and assigns,good
and marketable title to the real estate described in such deed, free and clear
of all liens and encumbrances, including any property taxes owned at the time
of dedication. This general warranty deed for dedicated public park land, as
well as any covenants for private park or recreational facilities, shall be
executed and delivered to the County Recorder together with the final
subdivision plat. The form of all deeds and dedication of land to the city
pursuant to this division shall be approved by the City Attorney. Subdivision
plats shall show dedication of land for park uses at approved locations. All
land to be dedicated to the city for park purposes shall be shown on the plat
as dedicated to Beavercreek, Ohio for park and recreation purposes.
            6.   Adverse effects of development; reclamation. Following
approval of any plan which designates land for dedication as required by this
section, the existing vegetation, topography, features of historic value,
stream courses, soil, rock strata and other natural features shall not be
altered or their condition adversely affected in any way except as directed in
this division or as directed by the Planning Commission. If, in the opinion of
the Planning Commission after consultation with the Parks, Recreation and
Culture Board, any portion of land proposed for dedication has been, or will
be, adversely affected by the operations of a developer and such land or
portion thereof will require reclamation in order to render it suitable as a
park or recreational facility, the Planning Commission may require the
developer to furnish a plan for such reclamation. After approval of such plan
by the city, the developer shall implement such reclamation plan within one
year of final plat approval. Required reclamation shall be included in the
developer's performance bond to ensure implementation.
            7.   Required improvements. Whenever land is dedicated, the
developer shall provide the following improvements:
               a.   Site grading necessary for the conveyance and disposal of
stormwater generated within or flowing through the park land;
               b.   Seeding of the park land utilizing an athletic field
mixture as specified by the Parks Board;
               c.   Fencing as specified by the Parks Board;
               d.   Full street improvements and utility connections within the
adjoining public rights-of-way including, but not limited to, street paving,
sidewalks, curbs and gutters, street trees and traffic control devices; and
               e.   Any other public improvements which the city determines are
necessary in order to make the dedicated park land suitable for development as
a park facility.
   (F)   Fee-in-lieu of dedication. In the event a developer is required to pay
a fee-in-lieu of land dedication, as outlined in division (E) above, the
following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Amount of fee. The amount of the fee shall equal the amount of park
land required to be dedicated under division (E) multiplied by the Fair Market
Value, less any credit allowed by division (G).
      (2)   Determination of fair market value. Fair market value shall equal
the average value per acre of all land in the development in its raw,
undeveloped state during the current year. The fair market value shall be based
upon an appraisal of the land value of the entire gross acreage of the
development. Such appraisal shall be prepared by a certified appraiser selected
and paid for by the developer and who is acceptable in advance of said
appraisal to the Planning and Development Director.
      (3)   Use and deposit of fees. The developer shall deposit all required
fees with the Planning and Development Department before the city will release
the subdivision plat for recording. Said fees shall be in cash form or surety
bond assuring future performance. All fees collected pursuant to this division
shall be deposited in the Parks and Recreation Capital Improvement Fund, to be
used solely for the acquisition, development and improvement of park and
recreational facilities.
   (G)   Exemptions. The following types of development shall be exempt from
the land dedication and fee requirements of this section:
      (1)   Non-residential developments;
      (2)   Condominium or cooperative projects which consist of the
subdivision of airspace in an existing apartment building when no new dwelling
units are added.
   (H)   Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the
contrary, the Planning Commission may in cases of an unusual or exceptional

plat released by the city for recording, the developer shall have executed a
surety with the city covering the estimated cost of required improvements.
Bonds shall be posted in the office of the Planning and Development Department.
      (2)   The surety shall run to the City of Beavercreek for a period of two
years from date of execution, and shall provide that the subdivider, his heirs,
successors, and assigns, their agent or servants, will comply with all
applicable terms, conditions, provisions, and requirements of these and other
pertinent regulations, and will faithfully perform and complete the work of
constructing and installing such facilities or improvements in accordance with
such laws and regulations.
      (3)   Before said surety is accepted it shall be approved by the proper
administrative officials.
   (C)   Expiration of letter of credit. The financial institution issuing the
letter of credit shall provide written notice of the upcoming expiration to the
City of Beavercreek Planning and Development Department no later than 30 days

designed for the high speed movement of a variety of vehicular traffic. It is
characterized by fully controlled access points with complete grade separations
at intersections. Expressways may have four to eight lanes of traffic with an
expected carrying capacity of 1,500 vehicles per hour per lane. See also The
City of Beavercreek Thoroughfare Plan.

Development under planned unit development provisions provides a means for
encouraging ingenuity, imagination and flexibility on the part of land owners,
engineers, architects, site planners and developers in the planning and design
of land areas. It is not the intent of the planned unit development provisions
to allow applicants to circumvent the intent of this Zoning Code or to allow
development of land not in conformance with the Land Use Plan of the city.

§ 158.061 MANDATORY PUD APPLICABILITY.
   Proposals for development shall be developed under PUD district provisions
when the Planning Director determines the development proposal exhibits one or
more of the following listed characteristics or a characteristic of similar
magnitude or nature:
   (A)   The total gross area of the proposed development is ten acres or more
in size, except;
      (1)   Detached single-family developments submitted for development under
R-1AA, R-1A and/or R-1B zoning district requirements;
      (2)   Developments submitted under RP-1 and/or ORP-1 zoning district
requirements;
      (3)   Developments proposed for A-1 zoned property and all of the uses
proposed for the development are permitted by A-1 zoning; or
      (4)   Developments in which the zoning designation of the subject
property is appropriate for the proposed development and such zoning
designation was in effect and approved prior to March 25, 1993.
   (B)   The proposed development involves uses permitted by standard zoning
districts in accordance with the provisions of §§
158.030 through
158.043 of this chapter, and such uses are permitted by one or more PUD
districts, and without PUD district zoning classification the development would
normally require the approval of more than one standard zoning district.
(Ord. 09-21, passed 7-27-09)
§ 158.062 VOLUNTARY PUD APPLICABILITY.
   Applicants of proposals for development in which the development is
determined, as per §
158.061, do not meet the conditions of mandatory PUD applicability may
voluntarily request to be considered for PUD zoning classification and
development under PUD district provisions. Approval for consideration shall not
be construed or interpreted as approval of the requested PUD zoning.
(Ord. 09-21, passed 7-27-09)
§ 158.063 TYPES OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS.
   Types of planned unit development districts include R-PUD (Residential
Planned Unit Development), C-PUD (Commercial Planned Unit Development), MX-PUD
(Mixed Use Planned Unit Development), and I-PUD (Industrial Planned Unit
Development). Each PUD district shall be governed by the requirements specified
for each respective PUD district and the general provisions governing Planned
Unit Developments.
(Ord. 09-21, passed 7-27-09)
§ 158.064 GENERAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   Project control and ownership.  Planned Unit Development district
designation is intended to apply to development sites that are under single
ownership or unified control to any comprehensive design, planning and
development of the site. The project land may be owned, leased, or controlled
by either one or more persons, partnerships, corporations or other appropriate
business associations capable of satisfying the objectives and requirements of
the planned unit development district. The city shall require proof of
ownership, covenants, easements, and other forms of property rights or control
to ensure satisfactory compliance with PUD objectives and requirements.
   (B)   PUD Agreement. Upon approval of a specific site plan, the city, at its
sole discretion, may require the PUD developer to enter into a PUD agreement
with the city, and to furnish a performance bond for the purposes of assuring
satisfactory completion of all requirements for site improvements such as
landscaping and drainage control facilities and any conditions and safeguards
as may be set by the City Council and the adopted ordinance approving the
specific PUD. At its discretion, the city may accept a letter of credit or
other form of performance guarantee and security in lieu of a performance bond.
In all cases the sufficiency and adequacy of such bond, letter of credit or
other form of guarantee or security shall be at the sole determination of the
city.
   (C)   Utility requirements.  All initial and all future expanded utility
systems within the limits of all planned unit development districts are
required to be placed underground. Utility systems subject to this requirement
shall be those that primarily serve the development within the PUD district and
shall include, but not be limited to telephone, cable television, and
electrical systems. Appurtenances of these systems which can be effectively
screened may be excluded from this requirement if the City Council determines
that such appurtenances are essential for utility service to other areas of the
community and that such exclusion will not violate the intent or character of
the proposed planned unit development or any conditions, restrictions or other
requirements imposed upon the development.
   (D)   Application process and sequence.  Due to the flexible and special
character of planned unit development districts and projects, and to assist the
city in evaluating the merits and making findings of proposed PUD projects, the
full PUD approval process generally involves either a two stage review or a
single stage/concurrent review. The applicant may select either the two stage
review process or the single stage/concurrent review process. Unless the
applicant informs the Planning Director at the time of submission of the PUD
zoning classification application of selection of the single stage/concurrent
review process, the applicant shall be considered to have selected the two
stage review process.
      (1)   Two-stage review process.
         (a)   First stage.  The first stage of the two-stage review process
generally consists of submission of an application for PUD zoning
classification in accordance with division (F) of this section and §§
158.065(A) - (C). The Planning Commission then reviews and makes a
recommendation on the PUD zoning classification application in accordance with
§§
158.065 (D) - (F). The City Council then, in accordance with §
158.065(G) and (H), reviews the PUD zoning classification application and makes
a decision to either approve as submitted, approve with supplementary
conditions or disapprove the application. Approval of PUD zoning classification
constitutes only approval of PUD district zoning for the subject property. A
specific site plan shall be submitted and approved prior to the issuance of a
city zoning permit for the subject property.
         (b)   Second stage. Unless the applicant selects the single stage/
concurrent review process as per division (D)(2) of this section, the second
stage of the two-stage PUD approval process begins at the initiation of the
applicant and is effective only if the PUD zoning classification application
submitted in the first stage was approved or approved with supplementary
conditions by City Council. The second stage generally consists of submission
of a specific site plan for the subject property in accordance with division
(F) of this section and §
158.066(A), (B), (F), and (G). An administrative review and recommendation upon
the specific site plan application is then conducted by the Planning Commission
in accordance with §§
158.066(H)-(J). The City Council then, in accordance with §
158.066(K) and (L), reviews the specific site plan application and makes an
administrative decision to either approve the application as submitted, approve
with supplementary conditions or disapprove.
      (2)   Single stage/concurrent review process. At the applicant's option
the first and second stage of the two-stage review process may be combined for
a single stage/concurrent review process. If the applicant elects such option,
a PUD zoning classification application and a related specific site plan
application, in accordance with §
158.065(C) and §
158.066(B), shall be simultaneously submitted by the applicant and both
applications shall together proceed through a single stage/concurrent review
process. In such case, the Planning Commission shall concurrently review both
applications, but shall first make a recommendation upon the PUD zoning
classification prior to making a recommendation upon the specific site plan
application. The City Council then shall concurrently review both applications,
but shall first act upon the PUD zoning classification prior to taking
administrative action upon the specific site plan application.
   (E)   Application completeness and officially filed status. Planned unit
development and specific site plan applications shall not be considered
officially filed until the applicant has submitted all applicable filing fees,
and submitted all information as may be required by the Planning and Zoning
Department. Completeness of an application and submission of all necessary
information is the responsibility of the applicant. Only after an application
is determined by the Planning Director to be complete and officially filed will
application review procedures begin. Applications for specific site plan
approval that do not adhere to the substantial conformance requirements of §
158.066(G) may be considered to be incomplete, not officially filed, and not
subject to city review procedures.
   (F)   Site arrangement requirements. The buildings, circulation, open space,
landscaping and other elements of the proposed PUD shall be arranged, planned
and designed on the site to produce:
      (1)   Favorable relationships with the existing natural topography,
bodies of water or water courses, existing desirable vegetation, exposure to
significant views and exposure to sunlight and wind;
      (2)   Safety, convenience and ease of pedestrian and vehicular movement
on, about and throughout the site and between the site and the community;
      (3)   An overall positive visual quality throughout, into and from the
development site;
      (4)   An efficient, functionally organized, and cohesive development;
      (5)   All areas designed for future expansion or not intended for
immediate improvements or development shall be landscaped or otherwise
maintained in a neat and orderly manner; and
      (6)   Landscaping and screening shall be as specified in §
158.135, Landscaping, Screening and Buffering.
   (G)   Zoning map identification. Areas approved as a planned unit
development district will be clearly marked and identified on the zoning map by
indicating the specific PUD district upon which approval was granted, either R-
PUD, C-PUD, MX-PUD or I-PUD; followed by the appropriate case number (Example:
"C-PUD 90-5").
   (H)   Multiple PUD projects. A proposed PUD project, either voluntary or
mandatory, shall be considered a "multiple PUD project" when each individual
use proposed for the project is permitted by at least one of the various PUD
zoning districts (Example: R-PUD), while at the same time all of the proposed
uses for the project are not permitted by only one, single PUD zoning district
(Example: R-PUD and C-PUD). A multiple PUD project requires differing PUD
district zoning classifications for respective, contiguous portions of the
property proposed for development. When the proposed development is a multiple
PUD project the applicant shall file a single PUD zoning application,
identifying each specific PUD zoning district, incorporating a functional and
general location phasing plan for each individual PUD, a functional and general
locational sequencing schedule for the full multiple PUD project, and all other
necessary application materials as per §
158.065 (C). A multiple PUD differs from a MX-PUD (§ 158.073) in that the
differing uses (such as, residential vis-a-vis commercial) are located in the
distinctive appropriate PUD District.
   (I)   Transition of PUD provisions and regulations.
      (1)   Effective date of §§
158.060 through
158.084 revisions. The provisions and regulations of this Zoning Code
pertaining to planned unit developments, §§
158.060 through
158.084, have been substantially revised by Ordinances No. 90-36, effective 11-
12-90 and as further amended by Ordinance 09-21 effective, August 26, 2009. As
used in this section, the effective date of the revised planned unit
development provisions and regulations is the same as the effective date of
Ordinance No. 90-36, effective 11-12-90 and as further amended by Ordinance 09-
21 effective, August 26, 2009.
      (2)   Previous PUD approvals. All PUD approvals, including any approved
modifications, amendments or conditions, approved by the city prior to the
effective date and where any time limitation for such approvals has not
expired, shall be governed by the planned unit development provisions and
regulations in effect immediately prior to the adoption of Ordinances 90-36,
effective 11-12-90 and Ordinance 09-21, effective August 26, 2009. If any time
limitation attached to an approval of a PUD, modification, amendment or
condition has expired, such approval shall be governed by the current
provisions and regulations of §§
158.060 through
158.084 and this Zoning Code.
      (3)   Applications filed prior to effective date. All PUD applications
and all requests to modify, change, amend or alter a PUD that are officially
filed, but not approved prior to the effective date shall be governed by the
PUD provisions and regulations in effect on the official filing date of the
application or request.
      (4)   Applications filed after effective date. On and after the effective
date, all PUD applications and all requests to modify, change or alter a PUD
shall be governed by the PUD provisions and regulations in effect at that time.
   (J)   Appeal of Planning Director determination.  In order to assure that
Planning Commission and City Council have all information pertinent to the
decision making process contained within this section, the Planning Director
has been given the responsibility to require additional information as
necessary in order for Planning Commission and City Council to make an informed
decision. Any applicant who objects to the provision of additional information
may request a determination by Planning Commission at its next regularly
scheduled meeting. No further action shall take place regarding the application
and submission until the Planning Commission has rendered its decision, which
shall be final.

§ 158.065 APPROVAL PROCEDURES FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) ZONING
CLASSIFICATION.
   (A)   Notice to applicants.  Notice is hereby provided to all applicants
that:
      (1)   Approval of PUD zoning classification shall not be deemed approval
of a specific site plan or approval of a zoning permit;
      (2)   The issuance of a city zoning permit for all or any portion of a
PUD project requires City Council approval of a specific site plan; and
      (3)   In accordance with §
158.066(C) and (D), unless an extended approval period is granted by City
Council, approval of any specific site plan shall expire if actual construction

within two years from the effective date of City Council approval of the plan.
All PUD site plans approved prior to the passage of Ordinance 09-21, effective
August 26, 2009, shall not expire for five years from the date of approval.
   (B)   Pre-application meeting. Prior to filing an application for a Planned
Unit Development, the applicant or his agent is strongly encouraged to meet
with the Planning Director or the director's designee. The purpose of this
meeting is to informally and generally discuss the proposed development and the
purpose, criteria and standards of the Planned Unit Development provisions and
this code, and to provide the prospective applicant an opportunity to ask
questions about PUD requirements and the PUD review and approval process. The
applicant shall note that no statement or representation of the Director, the
director's designee or any representative of the city during this pre-
application meeting and any subsequent pre-application meetings shall be
binding upon the Planning Commission, the City Council or the city. In
addition, the applicant is encouraged to engage in informal consultation with
the City Engineer, entities providing energy or utility services necessary for
the proposed PUD, and such other individuals, entities or organizations as
suggested by the Director or his designee.
   (C)   Application requirements.  The applicant shall officially file, in
accordance with §
158.064(D), an application for planned unit development district classification
with the Planning and Zoning Department and shall make payment to the city in

for the proposed development. The application shall contain an original and
copies of all application materials, as required on the checklist on file at
the time of application with the Planning and Zoning Department in a quantity
specified by the Planning and Zoning Department.
   (D)   Planning Commission public hearing and notice.  Notwithstanding §
158.175(F), the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on an
officially filed planned unit development zoning application within 45 days
after the application's official filing date. Before holding such public
hearing, notice of the hearing shall be given in accordance with §
158.175(G). Notwithstanding §
158.175(H), notice shall also be provided by first class mail at least 15 days
prior to the date of the hearing, and such notice shall be deemed given on the
date of mailing. Mailed notices shall be provided to all owners of property
within 500 feet from the exterior boundaries of the area associated with the
proposed PUD zoning classification or PUD amendment proposal. The city, at its
discretion, may provide notice by other alternative means such as hand
delivery, newspaper publication, electronic media, and any forms of notice
utilized in lieu of mailed notice, to owners outside of the 500-foot boundary.
The notice shall set forth the time and place of the public hearing and the
nature of the proposed development. The failure to deliver the notice as
provided in this section, so long as it is not intentional, shall not
invalidate the public hearing or any decision on the application.
   (E)   Planning Commission review and recommendation of PUD application.
After a planned unit development application has been determined to be
officially filed in accordance with §
158.064(F), the Planning Commission shall review and study the application and
any accompanying materials. In the course of its study, the Commission may
confer with other agencies of government, request additional information or
clarification from the applicant, and request additional study and comments
from the Planning and Zoning Department staff. The Planning Commission shall,
by resolution, recommend to the City Council that the request for planned unit
development zoning classification be approved as presented, approved with
supplementary conditions or modifications, or disapproved. The Commission shall
then transmit to the City Council all papers constituting the record and the
resolution containing the Commission's recommendation. If the Commission
recommends approval with supplementary conditions, such conditions shall be
fully expressed in the recommendation resolution. Any normally permitted or
accessory use that is recommended to be included in the specific planned unit
development shall be fully identified and expressed in the Commission's
resolution and based upon findings in accordance with §§
158.071(B),
158.072(B),
158.073(B), and
158.074(B). If the Planning Commission determines, in order to conduct a
sufficient review and make its recommendation, that additional information is
required from the applicant or additional study is required, the Commission may
table consideration of the application until such additional information is
received by the Commission or the Commission's study is complete.
   (F)   Criteria for Planning Commission recommendation. Before making a
recommendation for approval or approval with supplementary conditions or
modifications, as per division (E) of this section, the Planning Commission
shall find that the facts submitted with the application and presented at the
public hearing, and any modifications, amendments or supplementary conditions,
satisfy the standards and criteria for planned unit development approval as per
division (I) of this section.
   (G)   City Council public hearing and notice. Within 45 days after the
receipt of the Planning Commission recommendation and resolution, the Clerk of
City Council shall set a date for a City Council public hearing, notify the
applicant the date set, and such hearing, notwithstanding §
158.175(J), shall be held as soon as reasonably possible thereafter, unless the
applicant requests additional time. Before holding such public hearing, notice
of the hearing shall be given in accordance with §
158.175(K). Notwithstanding §
158.175(L), notice shall also be provided by first class mail at least 15 days
prior to the date of the hearing, and such notice shall be deemed given on the
date of mailing. Mailed notices shall be provided to all owners of property
within 500 feet from the exterior boundaries of the area associated with the
proposed PUD zoning classification or PUD amendment proposal. The city, at its
discretion, may provide notice by other alternative means such as hand
delivery, newspaper publication, electronic media and/or any other forms of
notice utilized in lieu of mailed notice, to owners outside of the 500 foot
boundary. The notice shall set forth the time and place of the public hearing
and the nature of the proposed development. The failure to deliver the notice
as provided in this section, so long as it is not intentional, shall not
invalidate the public hearing or any decision on the application.
   (H)   Action by City Council. City Council shall, by an affirmative vote of
at least four of its members, either deny the recommendation of the Planning
Commission or introduce and hold the first reading of an ordinance adopting or
modifying such recommendation. Following the third reading of the ordinance, a
planned unit development zoning classification request shall be either
approved, approved with supplementary conditions, or disapproved by at least
four members of City Council. In the event the City Council approves the
Planned Unit Development, with or without supplementary conditions, the Council
shall find, by ordinance, that the facts submitted with the application and
presented at the public hearing, and any modifications, amendments or
supplementary conditions satisfy the standards and criteria for Planned Unit
Development approval as per division (I) of this section. If City Council
approves the Planned Unit Development zoning classification, the approval
ordinance shall fully set forth any and all supplementary conditions for
approval, and all standard district permitted or accessory uses within the
specific PUD shall be fully expressed in the approval ordinance and based upon
findings in accordance with §§
158.071(B),
158.072(B),
158.073(B) and
158.074(B). If the City Council determines in order to conduct a sufficient
review and make its recommendation that additional information is required from
the applicant or additional study is required, the Council may table
consideration of the application until such additional information is received
by the Council or the Council's study is complete.
   (I)   Standards and criteria for Planned Unit Development zoning approval. A
planned unit development zoning classification shall only be approved when the
following standards and criteria are satisfied.
      (1)   The planned unit development complies with the purpose and intent
of this Zoning Code;
      (2)   The proposed development promotes the health, safety and general
welfare of the present and future inhabitants of the city;
      (3)   The proposed zoning and the conditions and requirements

the alternative and at the discretion of the city, adequate assurance has been
provided by the applicant and to the satisfaction of the city that such
objective will be achieved;
      (9)   Any permitted, conditional, or accessory uses excluded from the
specific proposed planned unit development are based upon findings in
accordance with §§
158.071(B),
158.072(B),
158.073(B), and
158.074(B); and
      (10)   The planned unit development can be substantially completed within

§ 158.066 APPROVAL PROCEDURES FOR SPECIFIC SITE PLAN.
   (A)   Notice to applicants. Notice is hereby provided to all applicants
that:
      (1)   Approval of PUD zoning classification shall not be deemed approval
of a specific site plan or approval of a zoning permit;
      (2)   The issuance of a city zoning permit for all or any portion of a
PUD project requires City Council approval of a specific site plan; and
      (3)   In accordance with divisions (C) and (D) of this section, unless an
extended approval period is granted by City Council, approval of any specific
site plan shall expire if actual construction has not started in the area of
approval for the respective specific site plan within two years from the
effective date of City Council approval of the plan.
   (B)   Required specific site plan application. Prior to the issuance of a
city zoning permit for any PUD project, a specific site plan application shall
be officially filed in accordance with §
158.064 (F), proceed through the review and approval process as per divisions
(G) - (K) of this section, and shall be approved by City Council. All specific
site plan applications shall incorporate a minimum area of five acres. In cases
in which the total gross area of the property approved for PUD zoning
classification is less than five acres, the specific site plan shall
incorporate 100% of the PUD property. In all cases the area incorporated in a
specific site plan shall be contiguous.
   (C)   Expiration of specific site plan approval. Unless an extended approval
period is granted in accordance with division (D) of this section, approval or
approval with supplementary conditions of any specific site plan shall expire
if, in the judgment and determination of the city, the actual start of
construction has not begun in the approved area of the respective specific site
plan within two years from the effective date of City Council approval of the
respective plan. In the event of expiration of an approved specific site plan,
the applicant shall start afresh, submit a specific site plan application in
accordance with §§
158.064(F) and division (E) of this section, and the application shall proceed
through the review and approval process as per divisions (G) - (K) of this
section. All PUD site plans approved prior to the passage of this section shall
not expire for five years from the date of approval.
   (D)   Extension of specific site plan approval period.  Upon request by the
owner, a one-time only, administrative extension of the two-year approval
period for a specific site plan may be granted by the City Council. In the
event such an extension is granted, the period of extension shall not exceed
one year. The owner shall submit a written request for an extended site plan
approval period to the Planning Director. The written request shall be
submitted no sooner than nine months prior to, but no later than 90 days prior
to the expiration date of the approved specific site plan which is the subject
of the request for approval period extension. The written request shall include
the necessity for the extension; submission of documentation and evidence that
the owner has made a reasonable effort to begin the actual start of
construction; the reason(s) why construction has not actually started to date
and will not start prior to expiration of the specific site plan; the requested
length of time to extend the specific site plan approval period (not to exceed
one year); a description of the impact and major effects upon the full PUD
project if the requested extension is not approved; a description of the major
effects upon the full PUD project if the requested extension is approved,
including changes in phasing or staging plans; and a revised time schedule
showing the dates when construction will actually start for the area of the
specific site plan and, if applicable, the remaining areas of the complete PUD
project. Within 45 days from the Planning Director's receipt of the owner's
written request the Director shall forward the owner's request and the
Director's comments and recommendation to the City Council. Within 45 days
after City Council receives the request and the Planning Director's comments

than requested by the owner. Any extension of approval period for a specific
site plan shall become effective and begin to run on the date of Council
approval of such extension. Council shall approve an extended approval period
for a specific site plan only when the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner has submitted a written request for an extended approval
period for the specific site plan;
      (2)   The subject property currently has a PUD zoning classification;
      (3)   The approval period for the specific site plan has not been
previously extended by City Council;
      (4)   An extension of approval period for the specific site plan will not
cause the city to breach any PUD Agreement made with the owner;
      (5)   The owner, in the judgment of the Council, has taken reasonable
steps and made reasonable efforts to actually start construction;
      (6)   An extended approval period for the specific site plan will not
violate the purpose and intent of §§
158.060 through
158.084 and this Zoning Code;
      (7)   An extended approval period for the specific site plan promotes the
health, safety and general welfare of the present and future inhabitants of the
city; and
      (8)   The period of extension for the specific site plan does not exceed
one year.
   (E)    Previously approved specific site plans. A specific site plan
approved by City Council shall be deemed null and void upon approval of a
subsequent specific site plan for all or part of the same property, unless
otherwise conditioned by City Council.
   (F)   Application requirements.  The applicant shall, in accordance with §
158.064 (G), officially file an application for a specific site plan with the
Planning and Zoning Department, and shall make payment to the city in an amount
equal to the established filing fee applicable to the specific site plan
application for the proposed development. As per division (G) of this section,
the specific site plan shall substantially conform to the PUD zoning plans,
concepts, schedules, development information and conditions as approved or as
approved with conditions by City Council. The application shall contain an
original and copies of all application materials as required on the checklist

quantity specified by the Planning and Zoning Department.
   (G)   Specific site plan conformance with approved PUD.
      (1)   An officially filed specific site plan shall substantially conform
to the PUD zoning plans, concepts, schedules and development information as
approved by City Council. If the Planning Director or the Planning Commission
determines that the officially filed specific site plan does not substantially
conform, the applicant may either modify the specific site plan to the extent
necessary for substantial conformance and resubmit for review, or start afresh
and submit a new specific site plan for review, or apply for an amendment to
the PUD zoning classification ordinance. Notwithstanding §
158.064(F), a submitted specific site plan shall not be considered officially
filed if the Planning Director determines prior to Planning Commission review
that the submitted specific site plan does not adhere to the substantial
conformance requirement.
      (2)   At the discretion of the Planning Commission, a submitted specific
site plan that contains modifications to the plans, concepts, schedules and
development information as approved by City Council, may be determined to
substantially conform. In no event shall a specific site plan be determined to
substantially conform if the specific site plan involves changes in permitted
uses as per §
158.068, or changes which result in exceeding any limitation or any maximum
amount imposed by an ordinance originally granting or amending the PUD zoning
classification for the subject property.
   (H)   Planning Commission public hearing and notice. The Planning Commission
shall hold a public hearing on an officially filed specific site plan
application within 45 days after the application's official filing date. Before
holding such public hearing, notice of the hearing shall be given in accordance
with §
158.175(G). Notwithstanding §
158.175(H), notice shall also be provided by first class mail at least 15 days
prior to the date of the hearing, and such notice shall be deemed given on the
date of mailing. Mailed notices shall be provided to all owners of property
within 500 feet from the exterior boundaries of the area proposed for specific
site plan or modification approval. The city, at its discretion, may provide
notice by other alternative means such as hand delivery, newspaper publication,
electronic media and/or any other forms of notice utilized in lieu of mailed
notice, to owners outside of the 500 foot boundary. The notice shall set forth
the time and place of the public hearing and the nature of the proposed
specific site plan. The failure to deliver the notice as provided in this
section, so long as it is not intentional, shall not invalidate the public
hearing or any decision on the application.
   (I)   Recommendation by Planning Commission. Planning Commission shall take
administrative action and, by resolution, recommend to the City Council that
the submitted specific site plan be approved as presented, or approved with
supplementary conditions or modifications, or disapproved. The Commission shall
then transmit all papers constituting the record and the resolution containing
the Commission's recommendation to the Council. All resolutions for specific
site plan recommendations to City Council shall indicate the Commission is
taking administrative action, and if the Commission's recommendation is for
approval with supplementary conditions, the resolution shall fully express such
conditions. If the Planning Commission determines in order to conduct a
sufficient review and make its recommendation that additional information is
required from the applicant or additional study is required, the Commission may
table consideration of the application until such additional information is
received by the Commission or the Commission's study is complete.
   (J)   Criteria for Planning Commission recommendation.  Before making a
recommendation for approval or approval with supplementary conditions in
accordance with division (I) of this section, the Planning Commission shall
find, by resolution, that the facts submitted with the specific site plan
application and presented at the public hearing, and any modifications,
amendments or supplementary conditions, satisfy the standards and criteria for
specific site plan approval as per division (M) of this section.
   (K)   City Council public hearing and action. Within 45 days after the
receipt of the Planning Commission recommendation, the Clerk of the City
Council shall set a date for a public hearing and such hearing, notwithstanding
§
158.175(J), shall be held as soon as reasonably possible thereafter, unless the
applicant requests additional time. The public hearing shall be for the
purposes of taking administrative action on the proposed specific site plan.
Following the scheduled hearing the City Council shall, by motion, either
approve, approve with supplementary conditions, or disapprove the proposed
specific site plan. Approval of such motion requires a vote of at least four
members of the Council. If the Council approves the specific site plan with
supplementary conditions, the motion for approval shall fully set forth such
conditions and be fully recorded in the meeting minutes. As the basis for City
Council approval of a specific site plan, with or without supplementary
conditions, Council shall find that the facts submitted with the application
and any accompanying materials, and any modifications, amendments or
supplementary conditions satisfy the standards and criteria for specific site
plan approval as per division (M) of this section. If the standards and
criteria of division (M) of this section are not satisfied, Council shall
disapprove the specific site plan and shall make findings of fact indicating
which particular standards and criteria are not satisfied. If the City Council
determines in order to conduct a sufficient review and make its decision that
additional information is required from the applicant or additional study is
required, the Council may table consideration of the application until such
additional information is received by the Council or the Council's study is
complete.
   (L)   Notice of City Council public hearing. Before holding the public
hearing specified in division (K) of this section, notice shall be provided in
accordance with §
158.175(K). Notwithstanding §
158.175(L), notice shall also be provided by first class mail at least 15 days
prior to the date of the hearing, and such notice shall be deemed given on the
date of mailing. Mailed notices shall be provided to all owners of property
within 500 feet from the exterior boundaries of the area proposed for specific
site plan or modification approval. The city, at its discretion, may provide
notice by other alternative means such as hand delivery, newspaper, electronic
media and/or any other forms of notice utilized in lieu of mailed notice, to
owners outside of the 500-boundary. The notice shall set forth the time and
place of the public hearing and the nature of the proposed specific site plan.
The failure to deliver the notice as provided in this section, so long as it is
not intentional, shall not invalidate the public hearing or any decision on the
application.
   (M)   Standards and criteria for specific site plan approval.  A specific
site plan shall only be approved when the following standards and criteria are
satisfied.
      (1)   The specific site plan complies with the purpose and intent of the

§ 158.067 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OBLIGATIONS AND BINDING AND ENFORCEABLE
CONDITIONS.
   If any portion of property included in a planned unit development is sold or
leased, the PUD zoning classification and specific site plan obligations shall
continue to be binding upon all subsequent owners or lessees, regardless of the
acreage involved in the sale or lease. As a matter of procedure, all terms and
conditions of any planned unit development zoning classification and specific
site plan that were approved by the City Council in the past or may be approved
in the future shall remain binding upon and enforceable against the subject
tract of land, except to the extent modified in accordance with §
158.070(A) through (C).
(Ord. 09-21, passed 7-27-09)
§ 158.068 MODIFICATIONS TO PUD PERMITTED USES.
   The permitted uses for an approved PUD include all uses identified as
permitted and accessory uses for the type of PUD district under which the PUD
was approved, except those uses expressly identified as excluded uses in the
ordinance granting PUD zoning approval for the subject property. Upon PUD
zoning approval, an applicant is not required to develop all uses permitted for
the applicant's specific PUD, however, an applicant shall only develop those
uses permitted for the specific PUD. Any request to modify or change the
permitted uses of a specific PUD, as such uses are identified in §§
158.071(B),
158.072(B),
158.073(B) and
158.074(B), and as may be conditioned by the original ordinance granting PUD
zoning classification for the subject property, requires an amendment to such
ordinance. Upon a request to modify or change the permitted uses for a specific
PUD, the city, at its discretion, shall require the applicant to either submit
a new, full application in accordance with §
158.065(C), or submit a modified PUD zoning application, or submit
supplementary materials to accompany the original PUD zoning application
materials. In all cases, proposed amendments to the original zoning ordinance
shall be subject to review and approval procedures in accordance with §§
158.065(D) - (I).
(Ord. 09-21, passed 7-27-09)
§ 158.069 SIMILARITY OF USES AND CONDITIONAL USES.
   (A)   Similarity of uses. Notwithstanding §
158.172(H)(2), the Planning Commission shall have the appropriate power and
duty to determine if uses not specifically mentioned in this Zoning Code are
similar to uses permitted in planned unit development districts. In no event
shall a determination of similarity of use by the Planning Commission overrule
a City Council determination of exclusion of uses from a specific PUD, and the
ordinance originally granting or amending PUD zoning classification shall
govern. If a PUD zoning classification application includes a list of intended
uses which requires a determination of similarity, the Planning Commission
shall make such determination before its review and recommendation on the PUD
zoning application or concurrently to its review and recommendation on the PUD
zoning application.
   (B)   Conditional uses within PUDs.  Planning Commission shall have the
appropriate power and duty to hear and decide upon applications for conditional
uses which are requested to be approved uses within a PUD. The Planning
Commission shall approve, deny, or approve with conditions for PUD conditional
use applications. Approval of a conditional use application shall expire one
year after the effective date of Planning Commission approval unless approval
of a specific site plan for that conditional use has been approved. Upon
approval of a specific site plan, the conditional use will expire with the
expiration of the specific site plan.

§ 158.070 MODIFICATIONS TO APPROVED SPECIFIC SITE PLANS.
   Requests to modify an approved specific site plan, when such requested
modification does not involve a change of permitted uses for the specific PUD,
may be approved by administrative action. Requests to modify shall be in
writing and signed by the property owner. The Planning Director shall determine
the type and amount of any additional information necessary for consideration
of the modification. Modifications shall be considered either major, minor or
incidental, and shall be approved or disapproved by administrative action in
accordance with divisions (A), (B) and (C) of this section. Requests to modify
an approved specific site plan which involve a change of PUD permitted uses
shall be considered a modification to PUD permitted uses and shall comply with
§
158.068.
   (A)   Major modifications. Major modifications are defined as modifications
which do not change the PUD's permitted uses and do not exceed any of the
limitations and conditions of the PUD's approval ordinance, and which result in
an increase of 5% or more in building coverage; a 5% or greater increase in
dwelling unit density; a significant redesign of roadways, or drainage; major
redesign of a building which significantly alters the central architectural
design or theme of the building; or modifications not considered to be of minor
or incidental character. Major modifications to an approved specific site plan
require resubmission of a specific site plan application in accordance with §
158.066(F). At its discretion and in lieu of compliance with §
158.066(F), the Planning Commission may require the applicant to either submit
a modified application or submit supplementary materials to accompany the
original specific site plan application materials. In all cases major
modifications to approved specific site plans shall be subject to review and
approval procedures in accordance with §
158.066(G) - (M).
   (B)   Minor modifications. Minor modifications are defined as modifications
which do not change the PUD's permitted uses and do not exceed any of the
limitations and conditions of the PUD's approval ordinance, and which result in
an increase of less than 5% in building coverage; an increase of less than 5%
in dwelling unit density; changes not exceeding 25 feet in building location
not affecting front yard setbacks from streets or setbacks from exterior
property lines of the PUD; an increase of more than five feet in the height of
a building or structure; minor redesign of a building such as significant
alterations to exterior materials or colors, provided the redesign does not
significantly alter the central architectural design or theme of the building;
or changes not considered to be of major or incidental modification character.
The Planning Commission shall, by motion, approve or disapprove minor
modifications to approved specific site plans. Such approval shall be based on
a Commission determination that the modifications are not in conflict with the
intent and character of the approved specific site plan and such modifications
do not change the permitted uses for the specific PUD. Minor modifications do
not require a public hearing and Planning Commission's decision shall be final.
   (C)   Incidental modifications. Incidental modifications are defined as
modifications which do not change the PUD's permitted uses and do not exceed
any of the limitations and conditions of the PUD's approval ordinance, and
which result in less building coverage due to decreasing the size of
structures; a decrease in the number of structures; a decrease in the number of
dwelling units in a R-PUD or MX-PUD; minor redesign of PUD streets, such as
adjustments in a turning radius; minor redesign, such as a realignment, of
pedestrian circulation facilities or parking or loading areas; changes in
landscaping or screening materials that do not alter the intended function of
the landscaping or screening; an increase of five feet or less in the height of
a building or structure; minor revisions of building elevations such as
realignment of major building entrances or window placement, or significant
alterations to exterior building materials or colors, provided the revisions do
not alter the central design or architectural theme of a building; or changes
not considered to be of minor or major modification character. The Planning
Director shall approve or disapprove incidental modifications to approved
specific site plans. Such approval shall be based on the Director's
determination that the modifications are not in conflict with the intent and
character of the approved specific site plan and such modifications do not
change the permitted uses for the specific PUD. In the alternative and at the
discretion of the Planning Director, the Director may request that incidental
modifications be approved by the Planning Commission.
   (D)   Expiration of specific site plan modifications. Unless an extended
approval period is granted in accordance with division (E) of this section,
approval or approval with supplementary conditions of any modification shall
expire if, in the judgment and determination of the city, the actual start of
construction has not begun in the approved area of the respective specific site
plan modification within two years from the effective date of staff, Planning
Commission and/or City Council approval of the respective modification. In the
event of expiration of an approved modification, the applicant shall start
afresh, submit a modification application in accordance with §
158.070.
   (E)   Extension of specific site plan modification approval period. Upon
request by the owner, a one-time only administrative extension of the two-year
approval period for a modification may be granted by Staff, Planning Commission
and/or City Council (depending on which entity approved the original
modification). In the event such an extension is granted, the period of
extension shall not exceed one year. The owner shall submit a written request
for an extended modification approval period to the Planning Director. The
written request shall be submitted no sooner than nine months prior to, but no
later than 90 days prior to the expiration date of the approved modification
which is the subject of the request for approval period extension. The written
request shall include the necessity for the extension; submission of
documentation and evidence that the owner has made a reasonable effort to begin
the actual start of construction; the reason(s) why construction has not
actually started to date and will not start prior to expiration of the specific
site plan; the requested length of time to extend the modification approval
period (not to exceed one year). For minor or major modification extension
requests, within 45 days from the Planning Director's receipt of the owner's
written request, the Director shall forward the owner's request and the
Director's comments and recommendation to the Planning Commission in the case
of a minor modification, to City Council in the case of a major modification.
Within 45 days after City Council or Planning Commission receives the request
and the Planning Director's comments and recommendation, the Council shall take
administrative action upon the request. The City Council shall, by resolution
and administrative action, either deny the request for extension, approve the
request for extension as submitted, or approve the request for extension for a
lesser period of time than requested by the owner. Any extension of approval
period for a modification shall become effective and begin to run on the date
of Council Planning or Commission approval of such extension. The Planning
Director (in the case of incidental mods) City Council and/or Planning
Commission shall approve an extended approval period for a modification only
when the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner has submitted a written request for an extended approval
period for the modification;
      (2)   The subject property currently has a PUD zoning classification;
      (3)   The approval period for the modification has not been previously
extended by City Council and/or Planning Commission;
      (4)   An extension of approval period for the modification will not cause
the city to breach any PUD agreement made with the owner;
      (5)   The owner, in the judgment of the City Council and/or Planning
Commission, has taken reasonable steps and made reasonable efforts to actually
start construction;
      (6)   An extended approval period for the modification will not violate
the purpose and intent of §§
158.060 through
158.084 and this Zoning Code;
      (7)   An extended approval period for the modification promotes the
health, safety and general welfare of the present and future inhabitants of the
city; and
      (8)   The period of extension for the modification does not exceed one
year.
   (F)   Previously approved modifications. A modification approved by City
Council and/or Planning Commission shall be deemed null and void upon approval
of a subsequent specific site plan for all or part of the same property, unless
otherwise conditioned by Planning Commission and/or City Council.

§ 158.071 R-PUD RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Intent. To provide flexibility in the arrangement and design of
residential dwellings based upon a unified development plan conceived and
carried out for the entire PUD tract. Within this district, appropriate and
reasonable population density is maintained while a variety of dwelling unit
types is permitted. Developers are to retain, natural features such as
topography, trees, and drainage ways. Such developments are generally
characterized by a significant proportion of usable open space, a unified
design concept with particular attention devoted to the periphery of the
development, with the objective of compatibility of the development with its
surroundings.
   (B)   Permitted, accessory and conditional uses.
      (1)   The permitted, conditional and accessory uses in R-PUD districts
are those uses included as permitted and accessory uses in residential
districts, excluding manufactured home developments. One or more of these
permitted and accessory uses may be excluded from the specific R-PUD when the
City Council determines that the specific permitted or accessory use normally
allowed in the listed residential districts is inappropriate for the specific
R-PUD. Such exclusion(s) shall be based upon at least one of the following
findings that the specific excluded use:
         (a)   Cannot be serviced by adequate public utilities; or presents the
potential for significant environmental damage and a satisfactory plan of
mitigation has not been provided by the applicant; or is inconsistent with the
overall character and other uses of the proposed PUD; or is inappropriate for
the topography of the site; or is incompatible with surrounding legal land uses
or other approved land uses; or is inconsistent with the City's Land Use Plan
or other approved plans of the city; or will create hazardous traffic
conditions; or will impose an unmitigated burden on public services and
facilities, such as fire and police protection; or
         (b)   Will not promote the purpose and objectives of the planned unit
development provisions of this code; or
         (c)   Does not advance the general welfare of the community and the
immediate vicinity and will adversely affect or impact adjoining or surrounding
development.
      (2)   Upon approval by City Council in accordance with §
158.069(B) those uses included as conditional uses in residential districts are
allowed in a R-PUD.
   (C)   Land use intensity.  For R-PUDs, the coverage of the total gross area
of the development shall not exceed 45% of the entire development. For the
purposes of this section, coverage shall be interpreted to include the area
covered by all buildings, all parking areas, all driveways, and all public and
private streets and paved rights-of-way. Structures and other impervious
surfaces included within, and developed as an integral part of an area of open
space may, at the sole discretion of the Planning Commission and City Council,
be excluded from the coverage of the total gross area percentage. Developers of
R-PUDs are encouraged to achieve an approximate equal distribution of coverage
for each individual phase or subarea of the total PUD.
   (D)   Land use density.  
      (1)   The overall density of a R-PUD shall not exceed the maximum density
allowed in the Land Use Plan for dwelling units per acre, excluding public
rights-of-way that are subject to impact fee credits.
      (2)   Lot requirements:
         (a)   The minimum lot width, in one-family R-PUDs shall be 60 feet.
         (b)   When designing site plans for proposed, one-family R-PUDs which
will abut existing residential developments, the lot size for the proposed lots
which are directly adjacent to the existing residential lots shall be, at a
minimum, the same area as the minimum lot size requirement of the existing
adjacent residential lots, or 20,000 square feet, whichever is less (i.e. if
adjacent to R-1B, then minimum lot is size shall be 16,000 square feet).
         (c)   There shall be a 50-foot buffer between multi-family projects
that have buildings with more than two units abutting existing, or approved
(but not yet constructed) single family projects.
   (E)   Building height regulations. No building shall be erected in excess of
50 feet in height, except, at the discretion of the City Council, the maximum
height may be increased when such increase is determined to improve site design
and the overall aesthetic quality of the development, does not adversely affect
surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities, does not obscure light and air
sources to immediately surrounding structures, and satisfies applicable fire
and safety regulations.
   (F)   Landscaping and screening. See §
158.135, Landscaping, Screening and Buffering. Upon approval of the City
Council, any of these requirements may be modified, provided that such
modification will improve the design and functionality of the site, increase
benefits to the community that are derived from the development, and will not
adversely affect surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities.
      (1)   New residential development proposed to be located adjacent to U.S.
35 or I-675 shall provide noise barriers consisting of an earthen mound, solid
masonry walls, permanent engineered sound barriers, or other similarly
effective methods or materials along the entire length of the right-of-way
abutting the project. The height of the barrier shall protect all residential
structures to a point at least ten feet above ground level. A sound study may
be required, which shall be provided by the applicant, to ensure engineered
sound barriers protect residential structures.
      (2)   If any habitable area of the residential structures would not be
completely screened by the noise barriers, the project developer shall either
extend the height of the barrier to provide such protection or incorporate
noise reduction measures in the residential structures. Such measures include
but are not limited to increased setback of structures from highway right-of-
way, utilizing materials that increase sound resistance, using construction
methods to provide air space and reduce vibration, sealing cracks around doors
and windows, reducing window sizes and installing double glazed windows. In
preparing plans for the above described noise reduction, developers shall be
guided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Noise Guide
Book.
   (G)   Exterior lighting. See §
158.136, Standards for Exterior Lighting. Upon approval of the City Council,
any of these requirements may be modified, provided that such modification will
improve the design and functionality of the site, increase benefits to the
community that are derived from the development, and will not adversely affect
surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities.
   (H)   Parking. Parking shall be provided in accordance with §
158.114, Off-Street Parking Regulations. Upon approval of the City Council, any
of these requirements may be modified, provided that such modification will
improve the design and functionality of the site, increase benefits to the
community that are derived from the development, and will not adversely affect
surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities.
   (I)   Off-street loading. Spaces shall be provided in accordance with §
158.113, Off-Street Loading Regulations. Upon approval of the City Council, any
of these requirements may be modified, provided that such modification will
improve the design and functionality of the site, increase benefits to the
community that are derived from the development, and will not adversely affect
surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities.
   (J)   Signs. In conjunction with and at the same time as submission of a
specific site plan application, the applicant may submit a proposed sign
limitation and control package specifically fashioned for the PUD. The
applicant may submit a proposed sign limitation and control package
specifically fashioned for the PUD for separate approval as a minor
modification to be considered and decided upon by the Planning Commission.
   (K)   Variances. Variances within R-PUD districts shall be applied for in
accordance with §
158.172(5). They shall be considered on a case-by-case basis for individual
parcels. The granting of a variance for an individual parcel shall not be
considered approval of a variance for any other parcel within the same or any
other district.

§ 158.072 C-PUD COMMERCIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Intent. To provide for the development of business, office and
commercial establishments within a unified commercial area and plan of
development. Within this district, business, office and commercial
establishments can be flexibly located to achieve compatible exterior physical
design, to utilize the site more efficiently than allowed by standard zoning
regulations, to take advantage of natural features of the site, to achieve a
higher degree of pedestrian and vehicular separation, to eliminate undesirable
features of strip commercial development, to reduce vehicular traffic conflicts
within the site and with public rights-of-way, and to enhance compatibility of
the development with its surroundings.
   (B)   Permitted, accessory, and conditional uses.
      (1)   The permitted, conditional and accessory uses in C-PUD zoning
districts are those uses included as permitted, conditional and accessory uses
in residential-office (RO-1), commercial and light industrial zoning districts.
One or more of these permitted, conditional and accessory uses may be excluded
from the specific C-PUD when the City Council determines that the specific
permitted, conditional or accessory use is inappropriate for the specific C-
PUD. Such exclusion(s) shall be based upon at least one of the following
findings that the specific excluded use:
         (a)   Cannot be serviced by adequate public utilities; or presents the
potential for significant environmental damage and a satisfactory plan of
mitigation has not been provided by the applicant; or is inconsistent with the
overall character and other uses of the proposed PUD; or is inappropriate for
the topography of the site; or is incompatible with surrounding legal land uses
or other approved land uses; or is inconsistent with the City's Land Use Plan
or other approved plans of the city; or will create hazardous traffic
conditions; or will impose an unmitigated burden on public services and
facilities, such as fire and police protection; or
         (b)   Will not promote the purpose and objectives of the planned unit
development provisions of this code; or
         (c)   Does not advance the general welfare of the community and the
immediate vicinity and will adversely affect or impact adjoining or surrounding
development without satisfactory mitigation measures.
      (2)   Upon approval by City Council in accordance with §
158.069 (B) those uses included as conditional uses in commercial and light
industrial zoning districts are allowed in a C-PUD. Wireless telecommunication
facilities shall automatically be a conditional use permitted in a C-PUD
district.
   (C)   Land use intensity. For C-PUDs, the maximum land use intensity and lot
coverage by all buildings, and by buildings and all other impervious surfaces
is as follows:
 
Maximum Coverage by All Buildings Maximum Coverage by all Buildings and
                                  Impervious Surfaces
35%                               75%
 
   (D)   Building height regulations. The maximum height of any building in a
C-PUD District shall be 70 feet, except, at the discretion of the City Council,
the maximum height may be increased when such increase is determined to improve
site design and the overall aesthetic quality of the development, does not
adversely affect surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities, does not
obscure light and air sources to immediately surrounding structures, and
satisfies applicable fire and safety regulations.
   (E)   Landscaping and screening.
      (1)   See §
158.135, Landscaping, Screening and Buffering. Upon approval of the City
Council, any of these requirements may be modified, provided that such
modification will improve the design and functionality of the site, increase
benefits to the community that are derived from the development, and will not

§ 158.073 MX-PUD MIXED USE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   (A)   Intent. To provide for the development of business, office and
commercial establishments, and varied residential living opportunities within a
unified plan of development. Within the planned development, selected
residential uses may be integrated with commercial, business and office
establishments, or developed as a subarea with residential neighborhood
characteristics. This district provides for flexibility in locating uses,
allows for utilization of the site more efficiently than standard zoning
regulations, allows for advantageous use of natural features of the site, and
allows for residential uses to be selectively integrated with or separated from
business, commercial or office establishments.
   (B)   Permitted, accessory and conditional uses.
      (1)   The permitted, conditional and accessory uses in MX-PUD zoning
districts are those uses included as permitted, conditional and accessory uses
in residential, commercial and light industrial districts, excluding
manufactured home developments. One or more of these permitted, conditional and
accessory uses may be excluded from the specific MX-PUD when the City Council
determines that the specific permitted, conditional or accessory use is
inappropriate for the specific MX-PUD. Such exclusion(s) shall be based upon at
least one of the following findings that the specific excluded use:
         (a)   Cannot be serviced by adequate public utilities; or presents the
potential for significant environmental damage and a satisfactory plan of
mitigation has not been provided by the applicant; or is inconsistent with the
overall character and other uses of the proposed PUD; or is inappropriate for
the topography of the site; or is incompatible with surrounding legal land uses
or other approved land uses; or is inconsistent with the City's Land Use Plan
or other approved plans of the city; or will create hazardous traffic
conditions; or will impose an unmitigated burden on public services and
facilities, such as fire and police protection; or
         (b)   Will not promote the purpose and objectives of the planned unit
development provisions of this code; or
         (c)   Does not advance the general welfare of the community and the
immediate vicinity and will adversely affect or impact adjoining or surrounding
development without satisfactory mitigation measures.
      (2)   Upon approval by City Council in accordance with §
158.069(B), those uses included as conditional uses in residential, commercial
and light industrial districts are allowed in a MX-PUD.
   (C)   Land use intensity. For MX-PUDs, the maximum land use intensity and
lot coverage by all buildings, and by buildings and all other impervious
surfaces is as follows:
 
Maximum Coverage by All Buildings Maximum Coverage by all Buildings and
                                  Impervious Surfaces
35%                               75%
 
   (D)   MX-PUD residential uses. Residential uses in MX-PUD Districts are
intended to be developed as separate, residential subareas of the MX-PUD.
Residential uses shall only be developed in MX-PUD Districts when the following
conditions are satisfied.
      (1)   If a non-residential use is planned or developed within a
horizontal distance of less than 100 feet from a residential use, residential
uses shall be developed only at the second story or higher of buildings in
which grade level use is a business, office or commercial MX-PUD District
permitted, or accessory or approved conditional use.
      (2)   The overall density of an MX-PUD shall not exceed the maximum
density allowed in the Land Use Plan for dwelling units per acre. When
calculating density, the acreage portion of the calculation shall not include
undevelopable areas where the natural or environmental conditions (i.e. steep
slopes, floodways, wetlands, etc.) would prevent the construction of
residential structures without an unreasonable investment to overcome these
natural constraints, or areas dedicated as or to be dedicated as public rights-
of-way and private streets.
      (3)   The minimum lot width in one-family portions of MX-PUDs, shall be
60 feet.
      (4)   When designing site plans for proposed, one-family portions of MX-
PUDs which will abut existing residential developments, the lot size for the
proposed lots which are directly adjacent to the existing residential lots
shall be, at a minimum, the same size as the existing residential lots, or
20,000 square feet, whichever is less.
      (5)   There shall be a 50-foot buffer between multi-family projects that
have buildings with more than two units abutting existing, or approved (but not
yet constructed) single family projects.
   (E)   Building height regulations.  The maximum height of any building in a
MX-PUD District shall be 50 feet, except, at the discretion of the City
Council, the maximum height may be increased when such increase is determined
to improve site design and the overall aesthetic quality of the development,
does not adversely affect surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities, does
not obscure light and air sources to immediately surrounding structures, and
satisfies applicable fire and safety regulations.
   (F)   Landscaping and screening. 
      (1)   See §
158.135, Landscaping, Screening and Buffering. Upon approval of the City
Council, any of these requirements may be modified, provided that such
modification will improve the design and functionality of the site, increase
benefits to the community that are derived from the development, will not
adversely affect surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities.
      (2)   Any commercial development proposed to be located within 1,000 feet
of any existing or proposed residential district or project shall present and
implement plans for providing a barrier from noise generated by the activities
of the commercial development. These activities include but are not limited to
loading dock and delivery activities, truck movements, idling and parking,
waste collection, compactor or shredding activities, roof mounted and ground
mounted mechanical equipment, and parking lots and driveways. Methods which may
be utilized include earthen mounding, solid masonry walls, permanent engineered
sound barriers, or other methods or materials of equal affect as those listed
above, which shall be approved by the Planning Department prior to
installation. The noise barrier shall be tall enough to exceed the height of
any noise source such as truck engines and exhaust stacks.
   (G)   Exterior lighting. See §
158.136, Standards for Exterior Lighting. Upon approval of the City Council,
any of these requirements may be modified, provided that such modification will

community that are derived from the development, and will not adversely affect
surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities.
   (H)    Parking. Parking shall be provided in accordance with §
158.114, Off-Street Parking Regulations. Upon approval of the City Council, any
of these requirements may be modified, provided that such modification will
improve the design and functionality of the site, increase benefits to the
community that are derived from the development, and will not adversely affect
surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities.
   (I)   Off-street loading. Spaces shall be provided in accordance with §
158.113, Off-Street Loading Regulations. Upon approval of the City Council, any
of these requirements may be modified, provided that such modification will
improve the design and functionality of the site, increase benefits to the
community that are derived from the development, and will not adversely affect
surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities.
   (J)   Signs.  In conjunction with and at the same time as submission of a
specific site plan application, applicants may submit a proposed sign
limitation and control package specifically fashioned for the PUD. The
applicant may also submit a proposed sign limitation and control package
specifically fashioned to the PUD for separate approval as a minor modification
to be considered on a case-by-case basis for individual parcels.
   (K)   Variances. Variances of MX-PUD districts (in the residential portions
only) shall be applied for in accordance with §
158.172(5). They shall be considered on a case-by-case basis for individual
parcels. The granting of a variance for an individual parcel shall not be
considered approval of a variance for any other parcel within the same or any
other district.

   (A)   Intent. To provide for the development of varied or similar industrial
establishments within a unified industrial area and plan of development. Within
this district, industrial establishments can be flexibly located to achieve
compatible exterior physical design, to utilize the site more efficiently than
allowed by conventional development standards, to take advantage of natural
features of the site, to achieve a higher degree of pedestrian and vehicular
separation, to comprehensively provide for necessary services and facilities in
accordance with a predetermined plan, to reduce vehicular traffic conflicts
within the site and with public rights-of-way, and to enhance compatibility of
the development with its surroundings.
   (B)   Permitted, accessory and conditional uses.
      (1)   Those uses included as permitted, conditional and accessory uses in
industrial zoning districts are permitted in an I-PUD District. One or more of
these permitted and accessory uses may be excluded from the specific I-PUD when
the City Council determines that the specific permitted or accessory use
normally allowed in the I-1 Zoning District is inappropriate for the specific
I-PUD. Such exclusion(s) shall be based upon at least one of the following
findings that the specific excluded use:
         (a)   Cannot be serviced by adequate public utilities; or presents the
potential for significant environmental damage and a satisfactory plan of
mitigation has not been provided by the applicant; or is inconsistent with the
overall character and other uses of the proposed PUD; or is inappropriate for
the topography of the site; or is incompatible with surrounding legal land uses
or other approved land uses; or is inconsistent with the City's Land Use Plan
or other approved plans of the city; or will create hazardous traffic
conditions; or will impose an unmitigated burden on public services and
facilities, such as fire and police protection; or
         (b)   Will not promote the purpose and objectives of the planned unit
development provisions of this code; or

                                  Impervious Surfaces
40%                               75%
 
   (D)   Building height regulations. The maximum height of any building in an
I-PUD district shall be 50 feet, except, at the discretion of the City Council,
the maximum height may be increased when such increase is determined to improve
site design and the overall aesthetic quality of the development, does not
adversely affect surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities, does not
obscure light and air sources to immediately surrounding structures, satisfies
applicable fire and safety regulations, and is necessary for the operation of a
proposed industrial use.
   (E)   Landscaping and screening. 
      (1)   See §
158.135, Landscaping, Screening and Buffering. Upon approval of the City
Council, any of these requirements may be modified, provided that such

   The ASRA approval process generally involves applicant submission of either
an ASRA detailed site plan, pursuant to §
158.077, for the entire site subject to ASRA approval, or in accordance with §
158.077, submission of an ASRA detailed site plan for a portion of the site,
plus submission of an ASRA general design plan, in accordance with §
158.077, for the remaining balance of the site not included in the ASRA
detailed site plan. If the applicant submits an ASRA detailed site plan for the
entire property subject to ASRA approval, the applicant is not required to
submit an ASRA general design plan. If an applicant receives, pursuant to the
provisions of this Zoning Code, city approval of an ASRA detailed site plan for
an area of an ASRA property or site that is less than the area of such site or
property, the applicant is required to submit an additional ASRA application
for ASRA detailed site plan approval for development on or within any portion
of the ASRA site that is not included in the area of the approved ASRA detailed
site plan. Such additional application shall be subject to the application,
review and approval provisions of §§
158.076(A) through
158.083. For the purposes of §§
158.076(A) through 158.084(C) the "site subject to ASRA approval," "ASRA
property," "ASRA site," or "ASRA property or site," shall mean the entirety of
that land or real property that received the approved zoning designation under
which the applicant proposes to develop the property.
   (A)   Notice to ASRA applicants. Notice is hereby provided to all applicants
that:
      (1)   Approval of an ASRA general design plan shall not be deemed
approval of an ASRA detailed site plan or approval of a zoning permit;
      (2)   The issuance of a city zoning permit for any portion of a property
or project requiring compliance with the ASRA provisions of this Zoning Code
also requires City Council approval of an ASRA detailed site plan for that area
of the ASRA property or site for which a city zoning permit is requested;
      (3)   In accordance with §§
158.081 and
158.082, unless an extended approval period is granted by City Council,
approval of any ASRA detailed site plan shall expire if actual construction had
not started in the area of approval for the respective ASRA detailed site plan
within two years from the effective date of City Council approval of the ASRA
detailed site plan.
   (B)   Pre-application meeting.  Prior to filing an application for
administrative an ASRA, the applicant or developer is strongly encouraged to
meet with the Planning Director or the Director's designee. The purpose of this
meeting is to informally and generally discuss the proposed development and the
purpose; criteria and standards of the ASRA provisions and this code, and to
provide the prospective applicant an opportunity to ask questions about ASRA
requirements and the ASRA review and approval process. The applicant shall note
that no statement or representation of the Director, the Director's designee or
any representative of the city during this pre-application meeting and any
subsequent pre-application meetings shall be binding upon the Planning
Commission, the City Council or the city. In addition, the applicant is
encouraged to engage in informal consultation with the City Engineer, entities

      (1)   An application for an ASRA shall not be considered officially filed
until the applicant has submitted all applicable filing fees, and submitted to
the Planning and Zoning Department all information as may be required by this
Zoning Code. Completeness of an application and submission of all necessary
information is the responsibility of the applicant. Only after an ASRA
application is determined by the Planning Director to be complete and
officially filed will application review procedures begin.
      (2)   Applications for ASRA detailed site plan approval that do not
substantially conform to a previously submitted ASRA general design plan
pursuant to the requirements of §
158.083 may be considered to be incomplete, not officially filed, and not
subject to city review procedures.

§ 158.084 MODIFICATIONS TO APPROVED ASRA DETAILED SITE PLANS.
   Requests to modify an approved ASRA detailed site plan, when such requested
modification does not involve a change of permitted uses for the ASRA site or
property, may be approved by administrative action. Requests to modify shall be
in writing and signed by the property owner(s). The Planning Director shall
determine the type and amount of any additional information necessary for
consideration of the modification. Modifications shall be considered either
major, minor or incidental, and shall be approved or disapproved by
administrative action in accordance with divisions (A), (B), and (C) of this
section.
   (A)   Major modifications. Major modifications are defined as modifications
which do not change the permitted uses for the ASRA property or site and do not
exceed any of the limitations and conditions of the ASRA approval, and which
result in an increase of 5% or more in building coverage; a 5% or greater
increase in dwelling unit density; a significant redesign of roadways, or
drainage; major redesign of a building which significantly alters the central
architectural design or theme of the building; or modifications not considered
to be of minor or incidental character. Major modifications to an approved ASRA
detailed site plan require resubmission of an ASRA application in accordance
with §§
158.076 through
158.080. At its discretion and in lieu of compliance with §
158.077, the Planning Commission may require the applicant to either submit a
modified application or submit supplementary materials to accompany the
original ASRA application materials. In all cases major modifications to
approved ASRA detailed site plans shall be subject to review and approval
procedures in accordance with §§
158.078 through
158.080.
   (B)   Minor modifications. Minor modifications are defined as modifications
which do not change the permitted uses of the ASRA property or site and do not
exceed any of the limitations and conditions of the ASRA approval, and which
result in an increase of less than 5% in building coverage; an increase of less
than 5% in dwelling unit density; changes not exceeding 25 feet in building
location not affecting front yard setbacks from streets or setbacks from
exterior property lines of the ASRA property or site; an increase of more than
five feet in the height of a building or structure; minor redesign of a
building such as significant alterations to exterior materials or colors,
provided the redesign does not significantly alter the central architectural
design or theme of the building; or changes not considered to be of major or
incidental modification character. The Planning Commission shall, by motion,
approve or disapprove minor modifications to approved ASRA detailed site plans.
Such approval shall be based on a Commission determination that the
modifications are not in conflict with the intent and character of the approved
ASRA detailed site plan and such modifications do not change the permitted uses
for the specific ASRA property or site. Minor modifications do not require a
public hearing and Planning Commission's decision shall be final.
   (C)   Incidental modifications. Incidental modifications are defined as
modifications which do not change the permitted uses of the ASRA property or
site and do not exceed any of the limitations and conditions of the ASRA
approval, and which result in less building coverage due to decreasing the size
of structures; a decrease in the number of structures; minor redesign of street
layout, such as adjustments in a turning radius; minor redesign, such as a
realignment, of pedestrian circulation facilities or parking or loading areas;
changes in landscaping or screening materials that do not alter the intended
function of the landscaping or screening; an increase of five feet or less in
the height of a building or structure; minor revisions of building elevations
such as realignment of major building entrances, or window replacement, or
insignificant alterations to exterior building materials or colors, provided
the revisions do not alter the central design or architectural theme of a
building; or changes not considered to be of minor or major modification
character. The Planning Director shall approve or disapprove incidental
modifications to ASRA detailed site plans. Such approval shall be based on the
Director's determination that the modifications are not in conflict with the
intent and character of the approved ASRA detailed site plan and such
modifications do not change the permitted uses for the specific ASRA property
or site. In the alternative and at the discretion of the Planning Director, the
Director may request that incidental modifications be approved by the Planning
Commission.

written request, the Director shall forward the owner's request and the
Director's comments and recommendation to the Planning Commission in the case
of a minor modification, to City Council in the case of a major mod. Within 45
days after Planning Commission or City Council receives the request and the
Planning Director's comments and recommendation, the Council shall take
administrative action upon the request. The City Council shall, by resolution
and administrative action, either deny the request for extension, approve the
request for extension as submitted, or approve the request for extension for a
lesser period of time than requested by the owner. Any extension of approval
period for a modification shall become effective and begin to run on the date
of Planning Commission or Council approval of such extension. The Planning
Director (in the case of incidental mods) Planning Commission and/or City

§ 158.125 NONCONFORMITIES.
   (A)   Intent. Within the districts established by this section or amendments
that may later be adopted there exist lots, structures, and uses of land and
structures which were lawful before this section was passed but which would be
prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this section for future
amendment. It is the intent of this section to permit these nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their continuance. Such
uses are declared by this section to be incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts involved. It is further the intent of this section that
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used
as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district except upon application to the Board of Zoning Appeals for approval of
specific plans. Expansions of existing nonconforming uses, where allowed by the
Board of Zoning Appeals, may be made only on property owned by the applicant as
of the effective date of this section. A nonconforming use of a structure,
nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall
not be extended or enlarged after passage of this section by attachment on a
building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the
premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be
prohibited generally in the district involved. To avoid undue hardship, nothing
in this section shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction
or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully
begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this section and
upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried out. Actual
start of construction is hereby defined as either the first placement or
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab
footings or the installation of piles. The following shall not be construed as
or be interpreted as constituting the actual start of construction: land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; the installation of streets
and/or walkways; the excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; the installation upon the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of a principal structure.
   (B)   Nonconforming lots of record.
      (1)   Single nonconforming lots of record. In any district in which
single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary
accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this section, notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of this section. Such lot must be in separate
ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership.
This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements
for area or width or both, that are generally applicable in the district,
provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to
area or width, or both of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be
obtained only through action of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (2)   Nonconforming lots of record in combination.  If two or more lots
or a combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in
single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this
section and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not meet the
requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this section and no
portion of the parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes
compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this section,
nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with a width
or area below the requirements stated in this section.
   (C)   Nonconforming use of land. Where, at the effective date of adoption of
this section, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible
under the terms of this section as enacted or amended, such use may be
continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful and is not enlarged or
increased nor extended beyond area designated nonconforming at the effective
date of amendment of this section except as elsewhere provided and in
accordance with the following provisions:
      (1)   Where the use of land involves a processing operation the operation
may be continued in the entire area utilized thereby. Modifications in
processing operations by rearrangement of facilities or changes in methods
shall be considered as part of such use.
      (2)   If any such nonconforming use of land is voluntarily discontinued
or abandoned for a period of more than one year, any subsequent use of such
land shall conform to the regulations specified by this section for the
district in which such land is located; and
      (3)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
section shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
   (D)   Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of this section or any amendment that could not be built under
the terms of this section or amendment by reasons of restrictions on area, lot
coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, bulk, or other requirements
concerning the structure, such structure may remain as long as it is otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in any
way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may
be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
         (a)   If the cause of the nonconformity of a principal residential
structure is that it is located within a required setback, an addition to the
principal structure may be constructed with a setback the same as or greater
than the existing nonconforming principal structure, but may not be located any
closer to the corresponding lot line than the existing nonconforming principal
structure.
      (2)   Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means, other than a natural disaster, criminal
behavior of someone other than the owner, or unintentional fire, to an extent
of more than 60% of the structure is destroyed, it shall not be reconstructed
except in conformity with the provisions of this section (see §
158.172(H)(5)). Existing nonconforming foundations, so long as they are deemed
safe, may be reused for the purposes of reconstruction, but may not be moved,
expanded, or altered in such a way that increases the nonconformity. This
section does not apply to any existing nonconforming foundations located within
a special flood hazard area, which shall not be continued if more than 50% of
the structure is destroyed.
      (3)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
   (E)   Nonconforming uses of structures or structures and premises in
combination. If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of a structure
and premises in any combination, exists at the effective date of this section
or any amendment that would not be allowed, the lawful use may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
section or amendment in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged,
extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in
changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which
it is located, except as provided in §
158.172(H)(4).
      (2)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
enactment of this section or amendment, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building;
      (3)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure or structure and premises may, upon submission of an application as a
conditional use in accordance with §
158.171(C), be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Planning
Commission finds that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more
appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting
such change, the Planning Commission may require appropriate conditions and
safeguards in accord with other provisions of this section;
      (4)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not
thereafter be resumed;
      (5)   When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and premises
in combination is voluntarily discontinued or abandoned for a period of more
than one year (except when government action impedes access to the premises)
the structure or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be
used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is
located.
      (6)   When nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises
in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
   (F)   Repairs and maintenance. On any nonconforming structure or portion of
a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary
repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or
plumbing provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming
shall not be increased. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of such official.
   (G)   Uses under conditional use provision not nonconforming uses. Any use
which is permitted as a conditional use in a district under the terms of this
chapter shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such a district, but shall
without further action be considered a conforming use.
   (H)   Restoring buildings. When a building or structure the use of which
does not conform to the provisions of this section has been damaged by
explosion, fire or act of God, to the extent of 60% or more of its reproduction
value at the time of damage, it shall not be restored or reconstructed or in
any way used except in conformity with the district regulations of the district
in which the building is situated. The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant an
exception under the provisions of §
158.172(H)(4).
   (I)   Violations not rendered nonconforming. A use, structure or lot in
violation of the provisions of this Zoning Code subsequently amended shall not
become nonconforming upon the adoption of an amendment, but shall continue as
violations.

upon submission of and approval of an application for zoning permit and
building permit.
      (2)   Any wireless telecommunication antenna permitted on the roof of a
building shall be set back one foot from the edge of the roof for each one foot
in height of the wireless telecommunication facility. However, this setback
requirement shall not apply to antennae that are less than two inches in
thickness mounted to the sides of antenna support structures and do not
protrude more than six inches from the side of such an antenna support
structure. The tip height of antennae shall not extend more than ten feet above
the top of the building or structure.
      (3)   Panel antennae may be located on the sides of tall structures so
long as the panel does not extend above the top of the structure.
   (F)   Standards for approval of antennae, towers, and sites. The following
standards shall apply to all wireless telecommunication antennae and towers.
      (1)   Network plan. The applicant shall be required to submit, along with
all other required information, a map drawn to scale showing the wireless
telecommunications provider's existing, approved and proposed facility sites
within the corporate limits of Beavercreek and within 2,500 feet of the city
boundaries.
      (2)   Necessity of location. The applicant shall be required to
demonstrate, using the latest technological evidence, that the antenna and/or
tower must be placed as proposed in order to satisfy a necessary function in
the company's grid system.
      (3)   Effort to co-locate. Whenever feasible, the use of an existing,
approved, or proposed tower, owned either by the applicant or another entity,
shall be utilized. The applicant shall demonstrate by clear and convincing
evidence that its antenna cannot be located on any other telecommunication
tower or tall structure in the vicinity and that it has undertaken all
reasonable means to avoid any undue negative impact caused by multiple towers
within an area. The applicant must demonstrate that it has contacted the owners
of nearby telecommunication towers or tall structures, requested permission to
install its antenna on those structures, and was denied permission. The city
may deny the application to construct a new tower if the applicant has not made
a good faith effort to mount the antenna on existing structures.
      (4)   Accommodation of city needs. The applicant shall agree to make
every reasonable effort to accommodate the telecommunication antennae of the
local police, fire and other public agencies.

facilities by the applicant, the applicant shall agree to the shared use of the
tower and support structures by other cellular telecommunication companies
where technologically feasible upon payment of reasonable fees, provided such
shared use does not violate any state or federal law. Applicants are required
to bear an equitable share of capital operating and other expenses in
connection with such shared use.
      (6)   Wireless telecommunication antenna and/or tower safety. The
applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed wireless telecommunication
antenna and/or tower is safe and that the surrounding properties will not be
negatively affected by tower failure, falling ice or other debris and must meet
all Federal Communications Commission standards.
      (7)   Color and appearance standards. All wireless telecommunication
facilities shall be designed or painted to portray a non-contrasting gray or
similar color minimizing its visibility, unless otherwise required by the
Federal Communications Commission or Federal Aviation Administration. All
appurtenances shall be aesthetically and architecturally compatible with the
surrounding environment by the means of camouflage deemed acceptable by the
city.
      (8)   Landscaping. Landscaping shall be required in order to screen the
support structure and any other ground level features. In general, landscaping
should soften the appearance of the wireless telecommunication site. Existing
vegetation on and around the site shall be preserved to the greatest extent
possible. The city may permit a combination of existing vegetation, topography,
walls, decorative fences or other features instead of landscaping, if they
achieve the same degree of screening as the required landscaping.
      (9)   Licensing. The applicant must demonstrate to the city that it is
licensed by the Federal Communications Commission.
      (10)   Required parking. If the wireless telecommunication site is fully
automated, adequate parking shall be required for maintenance workers. If the
site is not fully automated, the number of required parking spaces shall equal
the number of employees working on the largest shift. All parking
specifications and requirements shall be consistent with the applicable parking
requirements as established in the Zoning Code.
      (11)   Lighting/signage prohibited. Unless required by the Federal
Aviation Administration, no artificial lighting shall be permitted on any

§ 158.133 HOME OCCUPATIONS/HOME BUSINESSES.
   (A)   Statement of intent. While most commercial activities may be
incompatible in a residential neighborhood, the city recognizes that some home-
based commercial operations may benefit the community and can be conducted with
little to no impact on surrounding residential property. These regulations
prescribe minimum standards which must be met by a home occupation/home
business in order to preserve the character of residential neighborhoods, to
guarantee residents freedom from nuisance related to such activities, and to
ensure the proper utilization of public services. A home occupation/home
business which fails to meet the requirements of this section shall be deemed
to be in violation of the Zoning Code.
   (B)   Uses allowed. The following categories of uses are those allowed
within any residential district. Any other uses are strictly prohibited.
      (1)   Educational uses. Including, but not limited to, music lessons,
tutoring, religious instruction and nursery school/day care.
         (a)   For instruction purposes, the number of students shall be
limited to no more than two at one time.
         (b)   For nursery school/day care purposes, the maximum enrollment may
not exceed the number allowed by the state issued child day care license in
accordance with R.C. §§ 5104.01 through 5104.99.
      (2)   Office/Studio. Including, but not limited to business consultation,
computer/internet business, dress making/tailoring business, recording studio,
and artist studio. This may also include a business that maintains an office
within a dwelling, but conducts business activity at another location away from
the dwelling (i.e. landscaping and lawn care service, interior decorating,
cleaning services, direct sale of consumer products,) provided that all of the
operating standards listed below are met.
   (C)   Operating standards. In order to operate a home occupation in the City
of Beavercreek, the following operating standards must be met:
      (1)   Location. A home occupation shall be conducted entirely within the
principal residential structure. No home occupation shall be conducted in any
accessory structure, nor shall the storage of equipment related to the home
occupation be contained within any accessory structure.
      (2)   External appearance. There shall be no change in the external
appearance of the building or premises resulting from the home occupation.
There shall be no entrance or exit way specifically provided in the dwelling
unit or on the premises for the conduct of a home occupation, nor shall there
be any display of products or equipment visible in any manner other than one
sign, not to exceed two square feet in area, non-illuminated and mounted flat
against the wall of the principal building.
      (3)   External effects. No equipment or process shall be used in a home
occupation which produces heat, creates noise, vibration, light, glare, dust,

consumer products or services where parties for the purpose of taking orders or
selling merchandise may be held.
      (5)   Traffic and parking.
         (a)    Traffic. Traffic generated by the home occupation shall not
create safety hazards nor be substantially greater in vehicular size nor exceed
on any continual basis the average number of vehicle trips that would normally
be expected for a residence in a residential neighborhood.
         (b)   Parking. No area on the residential property may be created to
park any vehicles or equipment related to the home occupation. Any home
occupation business which requires the creation of parking in addition to the
parking area already provided for the single-family residence shall not be
operated within a residential zoning district. The conduct of a home occupation
shall not reduce or render unusable areas provided for required off-street
parking for the dwelling unit.

§ 158.134 TRANSIT STOPS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   (A)   Permit required. Applications for approval of transit stops on private
property shall be submitted for review and approval by the Planning and Zoning
Department.
   (B)   Location. The applicant shall work with the Beavercreek Planning and
Zoning Department and the Beavercreek Engineering Department to choose the most
logical location and traffic flow design for the transit facility to ensure the
safety of both users and non users of the transit stop on private property.
      (1)   Transit stops on private property will be, whenever possible,
designed to encompass existing off-street parking spaces, so long as the new
transit stop does not cause the number of parking spaces to drop below the
minimum required in §
158.114(S).
      (2)   In no instance shall transit stops on private property be located
so that transit vehicles have to load/unload passengers while parked in thru

§ 158.135 LANDSCAPING, SCREENING AND BUFFERING.
   (A)   General information.
      (1)   Intent. To promote and protect the public health, safety and
welfare through the preservation, protection and enhancement of the environment
by recognizing the vital importance of tree growth in the ecological system and
by fully utilizing the benefits of landscaping in development. It is further
the purpose of this chapter to: promote the preservation, replacement and
augmentation of major trees removed in the course of land development and
mitigate the impact of development, promote and utilize appropriate
landscaping, screening and buffering between land uses, soften the appearance
of building masses and paved areas and reduce generation of heat and storm
water runoff.
      (2)   Applicability. The requirements outlined in this section are
applicable to all new developments and redevelopments, within the City of
Beavercreek, except on properties used for residential purposes located in
residential (R-1AA, R-1A, R-1B) districts and properties in agricultural (A-1)
districts, unless said property is a non-conforming multi-family residential
structure in an R-1AA, R-1A, R-1B or A-1 districts.
      (3)   Application process. For PUD applications, general buffering and
screening requirements shall be included with the concept plan and a detailed
landscape plan, including a plant schedule shall be provided at the specific
site plan stage. For permits issued in straight zoning districts, a detailed
landscape plan shall be submitted with the zoning permit application.
      (4)   Alternative compliance. It is not the intent of landscape
regulations to establish arbitrary regulations or to inhibit creative solutions
to land-use problems. It is recognized that, under certain conditions, a strict
interpretation of the requirements may be either physically impossible or
economically impractical. These landscape regulations require certain elements
that meet certain objectives within the site plan. Requests for use of
alternative landscaping schemes are justified only when either the sites
involved have space limitations or unusually shaped parcels; when topography,
soil, vegetation, or other site conditions are such that full compliance is
impossible or impractical, due to a change of use of an existing site, the
required buffer yard is larger than can be provided; or other safety
considerations are involved.
   (B)   Plan preparation and submittal requirements. Landscape plans for
development must have the following information before the approval process
begins. The plan must be to scale between 1 inch = 10 feet and 1 inch = 40 feet
and must be drawn on a separate sheet of paper. The plan must include the
following:
      (1)   Property lines.
      (2)   Zoning and use of all abutting properties, location of buildings on
abutting properties within 100 feet of property line; and zoning and use of
properties directly across any collector, primary, or secondary street adjacent
to the subject property.
      (3)   Name, location, and right-of-way of all public and private streets.
      (4)   Natural features such as ponds, lakes and streams.
      (5)   Delineation of 100-year floodplain and wetlands, and 50-year
floodplain information may be required for certain project areas.
      (6)   Existing and proposed storm water management ponds.
      (7)   Required yard depths/widths (i.e., setbacks from all lot lines).
      (8)   Location, height, dimensions, and use of all existing and proposed
buildings and other structures (including parking lots, sidewalks, and other
paved areas; fences and walls; and recreational equipment) of subject property.
      (9)   Proposed grading in two-foot contours or better with any slope at
3:1 or steeper indicated. Storm water management ponds shall be indicated.
      (10)   Location of existing and proposed utilities and utility easements,
including water, storm drain, and sanitary sewer pipes; overhead wires; utility
poles and boxes; and signs if available.
      (11)   Location, size and description of all elements required to be
screened.
      (12)   Show existing vegetation, including existing trees equal to or
greater than eight inches DBH, measured at four and a half feet above base of
the tree. Existing trees must be shown at approximate size. It will not be
necessary for the owner/developer to survey trees of this size in large areas
where woodland preservation is shown on the plan. Existing trees are to be
shown in plan view with the circle diameter, a.k.a. crown spread, the
approximate size of the existing tree canopy.
      (13)   Site tabulations including site square footage, open green space
square footage, parking lot interior, and quantity of trees required. Required
landscape strip width for front, side, and rear lot lines.
      (14)   Plant Schedule indicating key, quantity, scientific name, common
name, size, condition, and spacing of all plants shown on the plan. See Figure
9 in division 158.135 (C)(5) for an example of a plant schedule.
      (15)   Landscape plan symbols for proposed plants must be drawn at
approximate mature sizes specified in the chart below. The following table
shall be used in determining size of landscape symbols to be drawn on the plan.
Symbols or hatching patterns must be unique for each of the following
categories. See Figures 1 and 2 below.

   (C)   Landscape regulations and requirements.
      (1)   Requirements. The following are minimum requirements for landscape
plans. Creative landscape planning and design is encouraged provided it meets
the minimal requirements set forth in this section. Refer to §
158.135 (C)(2) below for design guidelines and recommendations on how to
approach the planning of the landscape. PUD proposals allow flexibility
provided they meet these minimum requirements.
         (a)   Residential requirements.
            1.   Multi-family dwellings; Subdivision (R-3, R-4, and R-PUD, or
non-conforming R-1AA, R-1A, R-1B or A-1). A minimum of one shade tree is
required per 2,500 square feet or fraction of open green space provided. One-
half of the number of required shade trees may be satisfied on a 2:1 basis by
the use of ornamental trees (not to exceed one-fourth of the required number of
shade trees) and evergreen trees (not to exceed one-fourth of the required
number of shade trees). Lakes or other water areas, any required parking lot
landscaped strip adjacent to a public right-of-way, and any required interior
parking lot green area shall be excluded when determining the total amount of
green area provided. This requirement is separate from parking and screening
requirements. Trees shall be located so as to best fulfill the design
guidelines set forth in §
158.135(C)(2).
            2.   Townhouses (R-2, or non-conforming R-1AA, R-1A, R-1B or A-1).
There shall be a minimum total of one and one-half shade trees required per
2,500 square feet or fraction of open green space provided, and one ornamental
or evergreen tree per dwelling unit, to be located on individual lots, and in
common open space, so as to best fulfill the design guidelines set forth in §
158.135(C)(2).
            3.   Manufactured Homes (R-5). In all manufactured home
developments, screening shall be provided along all rear and side property
lines which abut other residential districts. See buffering and screening
requirements in §
158.135(E). Such screening shall be in accordance with the schedule of required
buffers between zoning districts, as described in §
158.135 (E). For each unit there shall be one shade tree located between the
unit and the street, while not blocking vehicle ingress and egress or creating
a line of sight hazard onto the lot.
            4.   Single Family (R-PUD, R-1AA, R-1A, R-1B or A-1). There shall
be a minimum of one shade tree on each single family lot, between the sidewalk
and the front of the principle structure.
         (b)   Neighborhood Business District (B-1). For neighborhood business
districts, the following shall be required. A minimum total of one shade tree
is required per 1,600 square feet or fraction of green space provided. This
requirement is separate from parking and screening requirements.
         (c)   Commercial and industrial developments (B-2, B-3, B-4, O-1, ORP-
1, RP-1, RO-1, I-1, I-2). In all commercial and industrial districts, and in
the case of all nonresidential uses in residential districts, one shade tree is
required per 2,000 square feet or fraction of open green space provided. A
landscaped strip, as described in §
158.135(C)(2) , shall be provided on the property adjacent to all public
rights-of-way. New commercial and industrial planned unit developments (PUD) or
major modifications to a PUD have a minimum requirement of maintaining 25%
green space of the total open space provided on the site. See §§
158.072 - 158.074. Interior streets in nonresidential districts shall be
landscaped such that there is at least one canopy deciduous or evergreen tree
per 35 linear feet of frontage along the road right-of-way, three ornamental
trees per 40 feet of frontage along the road right-of-way, the landscape strip
within the subdivision shall be planted in grass and there shall be a massing
of ornamental grasses, perennials, and/or annuals or bulbs are required at the
entrance to individual lots.
         (d)   Mixed Use Planned Unit Development (MX-PUD).  In all PUDs where
commercial and residential uses coexist, the areas that are commercial must
comply with the commercial and industrial requirements in this section. The
residential areas must comply with the residential requirements of this
section. The boundaries between different uses in a MX-PUD must be shown on the
landscape plan.
      (2)   Parking lot requirements.
         (a)   Landscape strip requirements. When a parking lot in any zone is
located adjacent to a public right-of-way, a landscaped strip as described in
Figure 3 shall be provided on the property between the parking lot and the
right-of-way. The landscape strip may not include any paved area except
pedestrian sidewalks or trails perpendicular to the roadway, which cross the
landscaped strip. In the R- PUD or in other circumstances where greater parking
lot setbacks are required than those listed in Figure 3, the greater
requirement shall apply. Any of the following landscape strip treatments may be
used singly or in combination:
 
Landscape Strip Options
Figure 3
          Provide a minimum ten-foot wide landscaped strip between the right-
Option #1 of-way and the parking lot to be planted with a minimum of one shade
          tree and ten shrubs per 35 linear feet of frontage, excluding
          driveway openings.
          Provide a berm, the top of which is at least two and one-half feet
          higher than the elevation of the adjacent parking lot pavement. The
          slope of the berm or any other areas on the plan shall not exceed 33%
Option #2 (3:1). Berms should be graded to appear as smooth, rounded,
          naturalistic forms with varying heights, not linear in design. Avoid
          narrow bumps that result from creating too much height for the width
          of space. Plant with a minimum of one shade tree and five shrubs per
          35 linear feet of frontage, excluding driveway openings.
          Provide a minimum ten-foot wide landscaped strip and a minimum three-
          foot grade drop from the right-of-way line to the adjacent parking
Option #3 lot pavement. Plant the resulting embankment with a minimum of one
          shade tree and five shrubs per 35 linear feet of frontage, excluding
          driveway openings.
          Provide a minimum seven-foot wide landscaped strip between the right-
          of-way line and the parking lot, with a minimum three-foot high
          brick, stone or finished wall, matching the architecture,
          construction materials, and colors of the principal building, to
Option #4 screen the parking lot. The wall shall be located adjacent to but
          entirely outside the seven-foot landscaped strip. Plant with a
          minimum of one shade tree per 35 linear feet of frontage, excluding
          driveway openings. Drawing elevations of the proposed wall must be
          submitted with the landscape plan.
          Provide a minimum 25-foot wide strip of existing woodlands. Existing
          woodlands, if preserved, may be used in conjunction with other forms
          of screening. Where the plantings required in §
          158.135 (C)(2)(a) would result in an inappropriate or impractical
Option #5 design due to underground utilities, overhead wires, or other
          factors, the following will apply then either two ornamental trees
          may be substituted for one shade tree, two evergreen trees may be
          substituted for one shade tree or one evergreen tree may be
          substituted for five shrubs.

         (b)   Perimeter parking landscape requirements.  The following two
options may be used individually or in combination for perimeter parking
landscaping. The first option is to provide a landscaped strip between the
parking lot and any adjacent property line, that shall be a minimum of ten feet
wide for sites over 20,000 square feet and a minimum of five feet wide for
sites less than 20,000 square feet. Within this landscaped strip, provide one
tree and three shrubs per 35 linear feet of parking lot perimeter adjacent to a
property line. (This does not mean that shade trees must be located 35 feet on
center.) Any shade tree planted to fulfill another requirement of these
regulations, which is located within 15 feet of the edge of the parking lot, or
any existing shade tree exceeding four inches caliper, which is located within
15 feet of the edge of the parking lot, may count toward fulfillment of this
requirement. A second option is to provide a minimum 25-foot wide strip of
existing woodlands. If more than the minimum 25-foot width of existing
woodlands are preserved, the Planning Commission may waive part or all of the
requirements for landscape strip or perimeter parking lot requirements.
         (c)   Parking lot interior requirements. A minimum of 4% pervious area
of the total vehicular use area is required for parking lot interiors. This
requirement is separate from perimeter parking requirements, and shall provide
pervious areas devoted to landscape. Greater than 4% may be required in large
vehicular use areas at the discretion of the Planning Director or his or her
designee. When designing a landscape plan for the interior of a parking lot,
there shall be at least two shade trees which shall be located within 60 feet
of every parking space, measured from the trunk of the tree to the center of
the parking space. See Figure 5.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/8d30aa8ba1c8f35337445d139cf67ef72be56287/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3287.jpg]
            1.   There are three types of parking islands found in a parking
lot. Terminal islands are located and required at the ends of parking bays.
These islands shall be a minimum of nine feet wide. At a minimum, 75% of
terminal islands shall be planted with perennials and shrubs, not exceeding two
feet in height so as to not create a line-of-sight hazard. The remaining 25%
may be covered with grass or mulch. Standard Islands are located between
terminal islands, these islands shall be a minimum of nine feet wide. At a
minimum 75% of standard islands shall be planted with perennials and shrubs,
not exceeding two feet in height so as to not create a line-of-sight hazard.
The remaining 25% may be covered with grass or mulch. Interior parking islands
are located between bays, these islands shall be a minimum of eight feet wide
for double loaded spaces and six feet wide for single loaded spaces. At a
minimum 75% of interior islands shall be planted with perennials and shrubs.
The remaining 25% must be planted with groundcovers. See Figures 6 and 7.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/8d30aa8ba1c8f35337445d139cf67ef72be56287/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3290.jpg]
 
            2.   For the purposes of computing the total area of any parking
lot, all areas within the perimeter of the parking lot shall be counted,
including planting islands, curbed areas, corner areas, parking spaces, and all
interior driveways and aisles except those with no parking spaces located on
either side. Landscaped areas situated outside of the parking lot, such as
peripheral areas and areas surrounding buildings, may not be counted as
interior planting areas. See Figure 7.
            3.   If a parking lot less than 10,000 square feet is built without
interior landscaping and then later, additional spaces are added so that the
total of the lot is greater than 10,000 square feet, then the interior
landscaping shall be provided for the entire parking lot.
            4.   Planting spaces must be large enough to allow for healthy tree
growth and must be protected from car overhangs and opening car doors. Each
space shall have a minimum of 60 square feet of continuous pervious land area
provided for each tree. No tree planting area shall be less than six feet wide
in any dimension and curbs shall be provided for all parking spaces adjacent to
planting or pedestrian areas to protect those areas from overhanging by parked
vehicles. In the case where planting islands are parallel to parking spaces,
they shall be a minimum of nine feet wide. In cases where a planting island is
perpendicular to parking spaces and the spaces head into the planting island on
both sides, the island shall be a minimum of eight feet wide to allow for
bumper overhang. If parking spaces are located on only one side of such a
planting island, the island shall be a minimum of six feet wide.
See Figure 6. For all buildings requiring site plan review, wherever practical,
landscaped planting beds shall be placed adjacent to the building on front and
sides, and have a minimum width of four feet. Creativity of the bed shape and
dimension is encouraged. For the front and any facades visible from a public
street, a minimum of 60% of the exterior building perimeter shall be planted in
the planting bed adjacent to the building façade with a combination of small
ornamental trees, shrubs, groundcovers, perennials, ornamental grasses,
annuals, and/or bulbs. Planters with the above plant materials may be accepted
for a portion of the requirement.

         (d)   Credit for preserving existing trees. Credit may be received on
the parking lot interior landscape by preserving existing trees capable of
tolerating adjacent construction. In order to maintain any tree deemed eligible
for credit, the ground area under and within the drip line of the tree shall be
preserved from the trunk out to the edge of the drip line and shall be
maintained in existing vegetative landscape material or existing pervious
surface cover. The Planning Director or his or her designee may determine that
lesser areas will provide sufficient nourishment for the continued growth of
the preserved tree based on its species and specific conditions. A certified
arborist or a licensed Landscape Architect, at the owner's expense, may be
required to examine the condition of existing trees to be preserved when
technical issues beyond the scope of the Planning and Zoning Department arise.
The developer is required to contact the Planning and Zoning Department for a
tree preservation inspection prior to any grading or earth movement near
existing trees to ensure that proper tree preservation measures are taken. See
Figure 14 in §
158.135 (D)(6) for tree preservation measures. Grading under the drip line of
the tree or any disturbance including the movement of heavy equipment within
said dripline at any time during development is not permissible and will void
tree credits given by saving existing trees. Existing trees which were
preserved in the approved plan, but do not survive or exhibit characteristics
of dying must be replaced by the same number of trees credited toward the
existing preserved tree according to the Schedule of Credit for Preserving
Existing Trees, Figure 8. The required number of new trees may be reduced in
accordance with the following schedule in exchange for preserving existing
trees:

      (3)   Buffering and screening requirements. Screening shall be provided
in order to create a visual barrier that partially or completely obstructs the
view of structures or activities in order to minimize or prevent nuisances.
Additionally, it is to provide an acoustic screen to aid in absorbing or
deflecting noise, and to contain ambient debris and litter.
         (a)   Loading areas. All loading areas consisting of two or more
loading spaces, loading docks, vehicular lanes providing access to the above,
and service or maintenance areas shall be screened from residential zones and
all adjacent public roads. Either a minimum six feet high opaque wall or fence
that matches the architecture, materials, and colors of the principal building;
a six feet high earthen berm with plantings sufficiently high enough to screen
the loading area from adjacent property; or a screen of six feet (at the time
of planting) evergreen trees or shrubs, minimum of 15 feet on center, double
staggered row shall be used to screen loading areas. Greater than ten feet high
walls or fences may be required in areas where additional screening is needed
as determined by the Planning Director or his or her designee.
         (b)   Trash Receptacles. All trash receptacles shall be located on the
property so as to be accessible for trash collection by sanitation vehicles,
and shall not be located within the public right-of-way, or alley.
            1.   All trash receptacles shall be screened from public view, from
public streets, public rights-of-way, and from abutting or adjacent properties.
            2.   Screening on three sides of the trash receptacle shall consist
of a solid, opaque enclosure constructed of brick, concrete, concrete block or
other decorative masonry, and shall be consistent with the architectural
character of the development or principal building or structure. The open end
of the enclosure shall have a 100% solid opaque metal, vinyl, PVC, or wooden
gate that includes stop pins to lock the gates open for servicing and which are
not readily degradable due to sunlight, moisture, or wind, with self closing
hinges.
            3.   All exterior sides of the enclosure, except the gate, shall be
landscaped pursuant to §
158.135, Landscaping, Screening and Buffering.
            4.   Trash receptacle enclosures shall not be located any closer to
the road than the front of the principal structure.
            5.   All trash receptacle enclosures shall be a minimum of six feet
high, and large enough to enclose all trash receptacles used by the principal
use of the property. At the option of the property owner, the overall square
footage of the trash receptacle enclosure may be increased an additional 80
square feet to allow for outdoor storage of property.
         (c)   Mechanical Equipment. 
            1.   All mechanical equipment, such as HVAC systems and the like,
shall be screened from public view, from public streets, public rights-of-way,
and from abutting or adjacent properties.
            2.   Screening on three sides of the mechanical equipment shall
consist of a solid, opaque enclosure constructed of brick, concrete, concrete
block, vinyl, PVC, or other decorative masonry, and shall be consistent with
the architectural character of the development or principal building or
structure. Landscaping material, such as shrubs or evergreen trees can be used
in lieu of, or in combination with, the aforementioned materials, provided the
design results in the required opaque enclosure.
      (4)   Landscaping bonding requirements. Prior to the issuance of any
zoning permit for development in any district other those exempted by this
section, the developer/applicant shall submit to the city a performance bond,
cash bond, or letter of credit to insure the installation of landscaping as
approved. The bond or letter of credit shall be in an amount equal to the
applicant's estimate of the cost of installation as approved by the Planning
and Zoning Department and shall remain in effect until such time as the
landscaping has been completed as determined by the city. Upon completion of
the installation of landscaping, the applicant may request, in writing, the
release of the performance bond or letter of credit. Following an inspection by
the city and upon determination by the city that the landscaping has been
completed in accordance with the approved landscaping plan, 80% of the
performance bond or letter of credit may be released. However, the remaining
20% of the performance bond or letter of credit will not be released until a
maintenance bond lasting three growing seasons, or letter of credit equal to
20% of the initial performance bond or letter of credit to ensure maintenance
of the landscaping is submitted to and accepted by the city.
      (5)   Administration and enforcement. The Planning and Zoning Department
is responsible for the administration of the landscape plan review process, and
for the enforcement of these ordinances. The Department shall maintain a
checklist that lists the requirements set in this section in order to ensure
completeness of a submitted landscape plan. The Planning Director or his or her
designee shall work with the developer to make certain that all of the
requirements in this section are met, and shall approve a landscape plan and
bond amount that meets these requirements, and may enforce the requirements of
this section, before, during, or after construction of a project.

   (D)   Plant lists, details, specifications, and tree preservation measures.
      (1)   Landscape standards and specifications. Plants shall be nursery
grown in accordance with good horticultural practices, and grown under climatic
conditions similar to those in Southwest Central Ohio for a minimum of two
years. Trees shall meet current standards set by the American Association of
Nurserymen and shall be freshly dug, have outstanding form and be free of
disease, insects and/or damage. Park grade or environmental grade trees are not
considered sufficient. All planting areas shall be irrigated. Intent to provide
a sprinkler system should be shown on the landscape plan. A mixture of plant
materials is to be used; however the use of native plant materials is
encouraged. Two inches of processed, shredded mulch shall be applied to the
soil around the tree to help conserve moisture. Mulching is not considered as a
replacement for landscaping. Depth shall be a minimum of four inches for all
trees and shrubs and a maximum of two inch depth for groundcovers, perennials,
and bulbs. Mulch shall be placed at least three inches from the trunks of trees
and shrubs.
      (2)   Landscape specifications shall be as outlined as shown in Figure
10. Any item or procedure not described in Figure 10 shall be as specified in
the Landscape Contractors Association (latest edition).
         (a)   Plant materials. The landscape contractor shall furnish and
install and/or dig, ball, burlap and transplant all of the plant materials
called for on the drawings and/or listed in the plant schedule. Plant names
used in the plant schedule shall be identified by scientific name and common
name. All plant materials shall be equal to or better than the requirements of
the American Standard for Nursery Stock, American Association of Nurserymen
(hereafter referred to as AAN Standards). All plants shall be typical of their
species and variety, shall have a normal habit of growth, and shall be first
quality, sound, vigorous, well-branched and with healthy, well-furnished root
systems. They shall be free of disease, insect pests and mechanical injuries.
Caliper measurements shall be taken 12 inches above grade. Minimum branching
height for all shade trees shall be six feet, and the minimum sizes for plant
material at time of planting shall be as shown in Figure 10.

         (b)   Planting guidelines. A professional horticulturist/nurseryman
shall be consulted to determine the proper time, to move and install particular
plant material in order to minimize stress to the plant. Planting of deciduous
material may be continued during the winter months, provided there is no frost
in the ground and frost-free topsoil planting mixtures are used. All plant
material shall be dug, balled and burlap (B&B) or bare root in accordance with
the AAN Standards. The landscape contractor shall excavate all plant pits, vine
pits, hedge trenches and shrub beds as follows. All pits shall be circular in
outline, with vertical sides. The tree pit shall be deep enough to allow one-
eighth of the ball to be above the existing grade. Plants shall rest on
undisturbed existing soil or well-compacted backfill. The tree pit must be a
minimum of nine inches larger on every side than the ball of the tree. If areas
are designated as shrub beds or hedge trenches, they shall be cultivated to at
least 18 inches depth minimum. Areas designated for ground covers and vines
shall be cultivated to at least 12 inches depth minimum. Each tree, shrub or
vine shall be pruned in an appropriate manner to its particular requirements,
in accordance with accepted standard practice. Broken or bruised branches shall
be removed with clean cuts made on an angle from the bark ridge to the branch
collar, no flush cuts, to minimize the area cut. All cuts shall be made with
sharp tools. Trim all edges smooth. No tree wound dressings shall be applied.
All trenches and shrub beds shall be edged and cultivated to the lines shown on
the drawing. The areas around isolated plants shall be edged and cultivated to
the full diameter of the pit. Sod that has been removed and stacked shall be
used to trim the edges of all excavated areas to the neat lines of the plant
pit saucers, the edges of shrub areas, hedge trenches and vine pockets. After
cultivation and eventual routine maintenance, all plant materials and plant
beds shall be mulched with a four-inch to three-inch layer of finely shredded,
processed, dark hardwood mulch of uniform texture and size. Large shredded
twigs and branches are not considered mulch. Mulch is not considered as
landscaping or as a substitute for plant materials.
      (3)   Acceptable tree list. The acceptable tree list for the city, as
highlighted in the City's Landscape Guidelines, is designed to encourage an
imaginative selection of landscape trees. Careful selection will prevent an
over-dependence on a few species. Alternative species may be used on the site,
but list represents acceptable trees that will not be questioned. Planting and
maintaining a diverse urban forest is one of the goals of the creation of this
list. Deviations from the acceptable tree list are permitted with the approval
of Planning and Zoning Department.
      (4)   Landscape Plan modification. An approved landscape plan in need of
minor revisions to plant materials due to seasonal planting problems or lack of
plant availability may be revised so long as there is no reduction in the
quantity of plant materials, no significant change in size or location of plant
materials, new plant materials fall within the same general functional category
of plants (shade trees, ornamental trees, evergreens, etc.). The proposed new
plant materials must be considered appropriate with respect to elements
necessary for good survival and continued growth.
         (a)   A letter shall be submitted to the Planning Director or his or
her designee requesting a minor revision for plant substitution. The letter
shall include a list of the quantities, types and sizes of the original plants
and the proposed substitutions, locations of the substitute plants on the plan,
reference to the approved permit number, and the name and telephone number of a
contact individual, and any other information deemed necessary by the Planning
Director or his or her designee. The Planning Director or his or her designee
will notify the applicant in a timely manner whether or not the proposed plant
materials meet the criteria listed above. If the substitutions are approved,
the applicant will be informed of any additional actions or information
required to finalize and document the plant substitutions. If the plant
substitutions requested are not approved, the Planning Director or his or her
designee will supply the applicant with specific recommendations for changes
that will make the plant substitutions approvable. If the requested revisions
to the landscape plan do not fulfill the four criteria listed above, they may
not be approved in accordance with the plant substitution process. In this case
the Planning Director or his or her designee will inform the applicant of
procedures necessary for a formal revision to the plan.
      (5)   Planting methods and details. Planting methods shall be as
highlighted as follows:

IMAGES/0-0-0-3296.jpg]
 
      (6)   Tree preservation measures. Orange fencing shall be placed around
preserved trees on site prior to any grading or earthworks. See Figure 13. The
Planning and Zoning Department shall be notified to inspect fencing around
trees to be saved prior to grading or excavation.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/8d30aa8ba1c8f35337445d139cf67ef72be56287/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3299.jpg]
 
      (7)   Maintenance. Regular maintenance is necessary of all required
landscape areas. Plant materials shall be kept in a vigorous and healthy
condition, free from diseases, pests, weeds, and litter. This maintenance shall
include weeding, watering, fertilization, pruning, mowing, edging, mulching or
other needed maintenance, in accordance with generally accepted horticultural
practice. Repair or replacement of required landscape structures (walls,
fences, and the same) to a structurally sound and aesthetic condition, the
regular maintenance, repair, or replacement, where necessary, of any screening
or buffering required by the zoning code is also required. Failure to regularly
maintain plant materials shall constitute a violation and shall be enforced by
up to and including the calling the bond or letter of credit. Owner will be
notified by the Planning and Zoning Department in order to inform him or her of
the nature of the maintenance problems. Owner will be given a maximum of six
months from the time of notification, or until ten days prior to bond or letter
of credit expiring, whichever comes first, to bring landscaping to a
satisfactory condition as by this section. All plants to be replaced must be
done accordingly in the same amount of time. Required plant materials or
preserved existing trees that are dead, diseased or severely damaged, shall be
removed by the owner as soon as possible, but no later than 60 days after
notification. Replacement plants must be the same size and species as shown on
the approved landscape plan or must be equivalent in terms of quality and size
to any existing trees on site of the same species at time of planting. Such
replacement will not be considered an amendment to the approved plan. Dead
trees may be required to be removed by the owner. The Planning Director or his
or her agent may require owner to hire a certified arborist to examine the
condition of a tree that may cause hazardous safety conditions. The Planning
Director or his or her designee must authorize the removal of any existing
preserved tree.
   (E)   Screening and Buffering. No buildings or structures shall be erected,
altered or enlarged nor shall land be used for any nonresidential use,
excluding agricultural uses (see §
158.030 Agricultural Districts) on a lot that adjoins or faces any residential
district until a plan for screening has been submitted and approved by the
Planning and Zoning Department and/or the Planning Commission and/or City
Council. For purposes of this section, a residentially zoned property shall
mean property zoned R-1AA, R-1A, R-1B, R-2, R-3, R-4, RO-1, R-PUD and approved
residential portions of a MX-PUD.
      (1)   Purposes for screening. Screening shall be provided for one or more
of the following purposes:
         (a)   A visual barrier to partially or completely obstruct the view of
structures, lighting, or activities in order to minimize or prevent nuisances;
         (b)   As an acoustic screen to aid in absorbing or deflecting noise;
and
         (c)   For the containment of ambient debris and litter.
      (2)   Types of screening permitted. Screening may be one of the following

§ 158.136 STANDARDS FOR EXTERIOR LIGHTING.
   (A)   Intent. This section intends to regulate outdoor lighting, in non-
single family residential neighborhoods, in order to establish appropriate
minimum levels of illumination, prevent unnecessary glare, and reduce both
spill-over onto adjacent properties and unnecessary transmission of light into
the night sky, sometimes referred to as "light pollution". It is not intended
to eliminate the need for an applicant to seek professional assistance to
determine appropriate lighting for the use and design proposed.
   (B)   Approved lighting plan. Whenever the installation or modification of
outdoor lighting is proposed or, for a commercial, industrial, multi-family or
conditional use of a site plan approval, the Planning and Zoning Department
shall review and approve all proposed lighting as part of the approval process.
These standards shall also apply to modifications to existing lighting
fixtures, whether or not site plan approval is required.
      (1)   A lighting plan submitted for review shall contain the following:
         (a)   A site plan showing the location of all existing and proposed
buildings, landscaping, streets, drives, parking areas and exterior lighting
fixtures;
         (b)   Specifications for all proposed and existing lighting fixtures.
These include: photometric data, fixture height, mounting and design, glare
control devices, type and color rendition of lamps, and hours of operation. A
photometric plan illustrating the levels of illumination at ground level shall
account for all light sources that impact the subject site, including spill-
over illumination from neighboring properties; and
         (c)   Relevant building elevation drawings showing all fixtures, the
portions of the walls to be illuminated, illuminance levels of walls and the
aiming of points of any remote fixtures.
      (2)   A proposed lighting plan shall be reviewed based upon the following
considerations:
         (a)   Whether the lighting is designed to minimize glare;
         (b)   Whether light will be directed beyond the boundaries of the area
to be illuminated or onto adjacent properties or streets;
         (c)   Whether the lighting will cause negative impacts on residential
districts and uses;
         (d)   Whether the plan will achieve appropriate levels of illumination
for the use proposed;
         (e)   Whether the lighting is in harmony with the character of the
surrounding area and the illumination levels of neighboring properties; and
         (f)   Whether the lighting is in keeping with the city's goal of
prohibiting unnecessary illumination of the night sky.
   (C)   Required conditions. When site plan or zoning permit approval is
required for the installation or modification of exterior lighting, the
following conditions shall apply:
      (1)   Light fixtures shall not be mounted in excess of the maximum height
limitation of the district in which they are located. For lighting in
residential districts and for uses adjacent to residential districts or uses,
light fixtures located on private property shall not be mounted in excess of 16
feet above grade. Fixture height shall be measured from the grade of the
illuminated surface to the bottom of the fixture.
      (2)   Electrical service to light fixtures shall be placed underground.
      (3)   No flashing lights shall be permitted.
      (4)   Glare control shall be accomplished primarily through the proper
selection and application of lighting equipment. Only after those means have
been exhausted shall landscaping, fencing and similar screening methods be
considered acceptable means for reducing glare.
      (5)   Outdoor lighting shall be designed to achieve uniform illumination
levels. The ratio of the average light level of the surface being lit to the
lowest light level of the surface being lit, measured in foot-candles, shall
not exceed 4:1. One foot-candle is equal to the amount of light generated by
one candle shining on a square foot surface one foot away. The average
illumination is determined by: adding the foot-candle value of all the points
in the photometric grid, and dividing the sum by the total number of points.
      (6)   The use of true color rendering lamps, such as metal halide, is
preferred over high and low pressure sodium lamps.
      (7)   Only necessary lighting for security purposes and limited
operations shall be permitted after a site's hours of operation.
      (8)   Lighting for security purposes shall be directed only onto the area
to be secured.
         (a)   All fixtures shall be located, shielded and aimed so that light
is not cast toward adjacent properties or streets or unnecessarily transmitted
into the night sky.
         (b)   Fixtures mounted on the building and designed to illuminate the
facade are preferred.
      (9)   Parking lot lighting shall be designed to provide the minimum
illumination necessary to ensure adequate vision and comfort in parking areas.
Full cut-off fixtures shall be used to prevent glare and direct illumination
away from adjacent properties and streets. Designs that result in even levels
of illumination across a parking area are preferred.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3412.jpg]
 
      (10)   The illumination of gasoline service stations and convenience
stores shall be the minimum level necessary to facilitate such uses. Excessive
lighting for the purposes of attraction and advertising shall not be permitted.
         (a)   Areas away from gasoline pump islands that are used for parking
and vehicle storage shall be illuminated in accordance with the parking area
requirements of division (C)(9) above.
         (b)   Light fixtures mounted on canopies shall be recessed or flush
with the bottom of the canopy. Where a drop-down fixture is used, the lens
shall be flush with (i.e., no more than one inch beyond) the casing so that
light is directed down and not sideways. All canopy lighting shall be shielded
to provide a cut-off angle of 85 degrees. Fixtures shall not be mounted on the
top or sides of canopies.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3305.jpg]
 
            (c)   The illumination of canopy sides is prohibited.
         (11)   The following illumination levels shall act as minimum
standards for all exterior lighting. Maximum lighting will be governed by the
4:1 ratio of average to minimum illumination of the surface being lit. Where a
site abuts a nonresidential district, maximum illumination at the property line
shall not exceed one (1) foot-candle. The city may modify these levels if such
modifications are deemed necessary and appropriate for the use and surrounding
area.

Building Entrances - Frequent Use   1.0
Building Entrances - Infrequent Use 0.2
*The minimum light measured in foot-candles at the point of least illumination
when measured at ground level.
 
      (12)   Where a site abuts a residential district or use, the following
special conditions shall apply:
         (a)   The height of light fixtures shall not exceed 16 feet;
         (b)   All fixtures shall have a cut-off angle of 90 degrees or less;
         (c)   No direct light source shall be visible at the property line
(adjacent to residential) at ground level; and
         (d)   Maximum illumination at the property line shall not exceed one
half foot-candle.
      (13)   The city may choose to waive or alter cut-off requirements of this
section when appropriate historic or decorative fixtures are proposed (e.g.,
use of decorative up-lighting to illuminate the underside of a canopy or
columns on a facade, where a canopy or roof projection restricts the projection
of the light into the night sky).

   (D)   Maintenance. All installed and approved light fixtures shall be kept
in good repair. This includes, but is not limited to, replacing non-working
bulbs, repairing broken or malfunctioning fixtures and similar activities.
Failure to maintain fixtures shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and
violators shall be subject to the penalty provisions contained in §
158.999 of the Zoning Code.
   (E)   Exemptions. The following uses shall be exempt from the provisions of
this chapter:
      (1)   Roadway lighting required by the appropriate public agency for
health, safety and welfare purposes;
      (2)   Lighting approved by the city as part of construction;
      (3)   Flag lighting, provided that the illumination is the lowest
possible level necessary, and that the light source is aimed and shielded to
direct light only onto the intended target, so as to prevent glare for
motorists and pedestrians;
      (4)   Emergency lighting approved by the city, provided the lighting is
discontinued upon the abatement of the emergency necessitating said lighting;
and
      (5)   Other temporary lighting determined to be reasonable and
appropriate by the city.

accordance with §
158.173 (C). In addition, when any sign is erected, placed, installed or

double fee shall not relieve any person from complying with other provisions of
this chapter or from penalties prescribed herein.

remain a permanent sign unless otherwise stated in this chapter. A renewal fee

defective parts, painting, cleaning, and other acts required for maintenance of
the appearance and structural condition of the sign.
   (G)   Removal of sign outside of the right-of way by the Code Enforcement
Officer. 
      (1)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall cause to be removed any
temporary or permanent sign that constitutes a public nuisance in that it
endangers the public safety, such as a sign which has been abandoned, is
illegal, is dangerous, or is materially, electrically, or structurally
defective. The Code Enforcement Officer shall also cause to be removed any sign
except a valid nonconforming sign for which no permit has been issued or a sign
which is not in compliance with the permit issued. Before removing any such
sign, however, the Code Enforcement Officer shall first prepare a notice which
describes the sign and specifies the violation involved. This notice shall
require that a permanent sign shall be removed or the violation corrected
within the next ten days or that a temporary sign shall be removed or the
violation corrected within the next 24 hours. If this notice is not complied
with, the sign shall be removed immediately following the applicable time
frames by the Code Enforcement Officer in accordance with the provisions of
this section.

certified mail, by placing in a prominent place on the property or delivery to
the property owner, current occupant, to a person temporarily or permanently in
charge of the establishment or the sign owner in case of temporary signs. Any
time periods provided in this chapter shall be deemed to commence on the date
of the service of the notice.
      (3)   The property owner and current occupant shall be jointly and
severally obligated to reimburse the city immediately for all third party and
administrative expenses incurred in removing any sign including but not limited
to costs to the city for the time of city employees. If the violations are
corrected and removal obligations paid, the property owner, the occupant or the
sign owner of temporary sign may reclaim the sign from the city.

Just as a private property owner may remove any sign placed on his or her
private property so may the city if the sign is in violation of this section
and/or this chapter. Such removal authority must be exercised in a
nondiscriminatory manner.
   (I)   Recovery of unlawful signs. In order to recover any unlawful sign
confiscated by the city, a sign recovery fee, as determined by City Council,
must be paid prior to pickup. Should the sign recovery fee not be paid within
ten days from the date the sign was confiscated, the sign shall become property
of the City of Beavercreek.

   (C)   Conditional uses. The Planning Commission is authorized to hear and
decide all conditional use applications, except for as provided in §

conditional use shall be submitted by the property owner or authorized agent
thereof on a form provided by the city to the Planning and Zoning Department,
along with a nonrefundable payment to the city in an amount equal to the
established fee for conditional use applications. The application shall contain
an original and copies of all application materials, as required on the
checklist on file at the time of application with the Planning and Zoning
Department in a quantity specified by the Planning and Zoning Department.
      (2)   Application completeness and officially filed status.  An
application for a conditional use shall not be considered officially filed
until the applicant has submitted all applicable filing fees and submitted to
the Planning and Zoning Department all information required by or under
subsection (6)(a) of this section. Completeness of an application and
submission of necessary information is the responsibility of the applicant.
Only after an application is determined by the Planning Director to be complete
and officially filed will application review procedures begin.
      (3)   Public hearing. The Planning Commission shall conduct a public
hearing on the conditional use application within 45 days after its official
filing date. Before such public hearing, notice shall be given by at least one
publication in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the

delivery of such notice as provided in this section shall not invalidate
subsequent action.
      (4)   Findings. After consideration of the nature and condition of all
adjacent and surrounding uses and buildings and a review of the conditional use
application and any administrative reports, the Planning Commission shall make,
by resolution, the following findings in deciding on the conditional use
application:
         (a)   The proposed conditional use is to be located in a district
wherein such use may be conditionally permitted;
         (b)   The proposed conditional use will not have a substantial or
material detrimental effect on surrounding properties and will not have a
substantially negative impact on or substantially conflict with surrounding
properties; and
         (c)   Taking into account current vehicular traffic volumes and
traffic volumes as may be expected to increase with increasing development of
the community, and taking into account vehicular turning movements in relation
to routes of traffic flow, street intersections, sight distances and pedestrian
traffic, the vehicular traffic to and from the conditional use can be
accommodated by the existing street network without significant adverse effect.
      (5)   Performance bond and violation. In approving a conditional use, the
Planning Commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in
conformity to the provisions of this Zoning Code. The Planning Commission may
also require security to assure conformance to such conditions and safeguards.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards shall cause the security to be
forfeited and shall also be deemed a violation of this code and punishable
under §
158.999(A), as well as loss of the right to continue the conditional use until
the requirements of these conditions and safeguards are met. An approved
conditional use shall maintain the status of a conditional use regardless of
the type of zoning district in which it is located.
      (6)   Burden of proof. The applicant shall have the burden of proving by
a preponderance of evidence that the standards set forth in subsection (4)(a-c)
of this section are met and the conditional use may be approved only if the
Planning Commission finds the standards have been met by such evidence.
      (7)   Effect of approval. The effect of Planning Commission's approval of
a conditional use application is authorization for the Planning and Zoning
Department to allow conditional use for that property. The decision of the
Planning Commission shall be final unless appealed to City Council pursuant to
division (E) of this section.
      (8)   Period of validity.  A conditional use approval shall expire two
years after it is approved by the Planning Commission unless actual
construction has taken place or is underway or actual occupancy has occurred
except as provided elsewhere in this Zoning Code. If a conditional use is
approved, the plan must be followed. Any deviation requires the resubmission of
an application for approval of the conditional use.
   (D)   Official action.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall act by resolution or motion on which
a majority of the members must concur in any action before the Commission. The
results of such resolution or motion shall be forwarded to the Council for its
action, except as may otherwise be provided in this chapter.
      (2)   In the event of a tie vote, the motion only fails, and a further
motion must be brought to a vote to resolve the issue. If an issue cannot gain
a simple majority vote at a meeting then the issue shall be continued until a
majority vote can be taken. A motion or resolution can only be voted upon by
members who are present at a meeting. If a majority vote cannot be achieved
after attempts to acquire a majority at two successive Planning Commission
meetings, the issue shall be forwarded to the Council for its action with a
notation that no recommendation is made by Planning Commission for reason of
failure to attain a majority vote.
      (3)   In cases where the Planning Commission makes a decision and not a
recommendation to City Council, if a majority vote cannot be achieved after two
consecutive hearings, the request shall be considered denied and the applicant
shall have the right to appeal to City Council, per §
158.171 (E).
      (4)   The Planning Commission shall review the Land Use Plan for
additions, deletions and changes no less frequently than every five years.
Recommendations shall be presented to Council for its action.
   (E)   Right of petition or appeal.
      (1)   Any person, firm or corporation, or any officer, department, board
or agency of the municipality who or which has been aggrieved or affected by
any decision of the Planning Commission may appeal such decision to the Council
by filing a petition with the Clerk of Council within 15 days from the date of

      (1)   Administrative review. To hear and decide appeals only in such
cases where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or
determination made by the Planning and Development Department in the
enforcement of this chapter and such appeal must be made within 15 days. The
concurring vote of three members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any
order, requirement, decision or determination of the Planning and Development
Department, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which the
Board is required to consider under the terms of this chapter.
      (2)   Determination of similar uses.  To determine if uses not
specifically mentioned in this chapter are similar to uses permitted within a
district.
      (3)   Determination of district boundary location. To determine the exact
location of any district boundary if there is uncertainty as to exact location
thereof. In making such determination the Board shall be guided by the
provision of §
158.017.
      (4)   Granting of exceptions. To hear and decide appeals for the granting
of exception to this chapter in the following instances:
         (a)   Permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a
district divides a lot or tract held in a single ownership at the time of the
passage of this chapter.
         (b)   Interpret provisions of this chapter, in such a way as to carry
out the intent and purpose, as shown upon the map fixing the several districts,
accompanying and made a part of this chapter where the street layout actually
on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the map aforesaid.
         (c)   Permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has
been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God, or the public enemy, where more
than 60% of the structure is destroyed, if the Board finds some compelling
necessity requiring a continuance of the nonconforming use and the principal
purpose of continuing the nonconforming use will not adversely affect the
health, safety or morals of the surrounding area.
         (d)   Reduce the parking and loading requirements in any of the
districts whenever the character of use of the building is such to make
unnecessary the full provision of parking or loading facilities or where such
regulations would impose a practical difficulty on the use of the lot, as
contrasted with merely granting an advantage or a convenience.
         (e)   The Board shall have the authority to grant an exception of a
building devoted to a nonconforming use upon a lot occupied by such building
where such extension is necessary and incidental to the existing use of such
building; provided, however, that the floor areas of such extension not exceed
in all 100% of the floor area of the existing building or buildings devoted to
a nonconforming use and provided further that such extension or extensions
shall be undertaken within five years of the date when the use of such building
became nonconforming.
         (f)   Provide exceptions to height limitations in accordance with §§
158.111 and
158.135.
      (5)   Variances. To vary the strict application of any of the
requirements of this chapter whereby such strict application would result in a
practical difficultywhich would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the
land or building involved but in no other case. Increased profitability is not
a valid basis for legally granting a variance. Under no circumstances shall the
Board grant a variance which will permit a use which is not permitted in the
district involved. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or
buildings in the same district and no permitted use of lands, structures or
buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a
variance.
         (a)   Granting of variances. No variance of the strict application of
this Zoning Code shall be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals until and
unless the Board has considered and weighed whether a property owner seeking an
area variance has encountered practical difficulties in the use of his or her
property. The factors to be considered when determining whether a property
owner has encountered practical difficulties in the use of his or her property
include, but are not limited to the following:
            1.   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable
return or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
            2.   Whether the variance is substantial;
            3.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
            4.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g., water, sewer, garbage);
            5.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with
knowledge of the zoning restriction(s) in place at the time he or she purchased
the property;
            6.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be
obviated through some method other than a variance;
            7.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement
would be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
         (b)   Application and filing requirements. An application for a
variance shall be submitted by the property owner or the property owner’s duly
authorized agent on a form provided by the city to the Planning and Development
Department, along with a nonrefundable payment to the city in an amount equal
to the established fee for variance applications. The application shall contain
an original and copies of all application materials, as required on the
checklist on file at the time of application with the Planning and Development
Department in a quantity specified by the Planning and Development Department.
         (c)   Procedures for consideration of petitions for variances.
            1.   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall make specific findings
demonstrating its consideration of the factors set forth in §
158.172 (H)(5)(a) and shall make a determination as to whether practical
difficulties in the use of the property by the property owner(s) have or have
not been demonstrated, and whether the granting of the variance is justified.
            2.   The Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Code. The Board may
require a bond or irrevocable letter of credit to assure conformance to such
conditions and safeguards as the Board may require.
            3.   Violation or noncompliance of such conditions and safeguards
when such are made a part of the terms under which a variance is granted shall
cause the bond or letter of credit mentioned in division (c)2. above, to be
forfeited or called upon and shall further be deemed a violation of this Zoning
Code and punishable under §
158.999(A).
            4.   Prior to acting on a request for a variance, the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing and give notice to property owners
as required in §
158.172(G) of this Zoning Code.
            5.   Period of validity. No variance granted by the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall be valid for a period longer than one year from the date on which
the Board grants the variance unless within such period: a zoning certificate
is obtained and the construction, moving or remodeling of structure is started,
or a Certificate of Use Compliance permit is obtained and a use commenced. The
Board may grant a maximum of two extensions not exceeding six months each, upon
written application, without notice of hearing.
      (6)   Conditional uses. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide
applications for wind energy conversion systems (WECS), as described in §
158.101(A) and applications for wireless telecommunications systems as
described in §
158.130.
         (a)   Application and filing requirements. An application for a
conditional use shall be submitted by the property owner or the property
owner’s duly authorized agent thereof on a form provided by the city to the
Planning and Development Department, along with a nonrefundable payment to the
city in an amount equal to the established fee for conditional use
applications. The application shall contain an original and copies of all
application materials, as required on the checklist on file at the time of
application with the Planning and Development Department in a quantity
specified by the Planning and Development Department.
         (b)   Application completeness and officially filed status. An
application for a conditional use shall not be considered officially filed
until the applicant has submitted all applicable filing fees and submitted to
the Planning and Development Department all information required by or under
subsection (6)(a) of this section. Completeness of an application and
submission of necessary information is the responsibility of the applicant.
Only after an application is determined by the Planning Director to be complete
will it be considered officially filed and will application review procedures
begin.
         (c)   Public hearing. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a hearing
on any conditional use application within 45 days of receipt of a fully
complete application. A notice shall be given at least 15 days in advance of
the time and place of such hearing, to the owners of record of all property
within 500 feet of the premises in question, with such notice to be delivered
personally or by mail addressed to the respective owners at the address given
on the last assessment roll and by one publication in one or more newspapers of
general circulation in the city. Any party may appear at such hearing in
person, by agent or by attorney. The Board shall decide the application within
a reasonable time. The failure of delivery of such notice as provided in this
section shall not invalidate subsequent action.
         (d)   Findings. After consideration of the nature and condition of all
adjacent and surrounding uses and buildings and a review of the conditional use
application and any administrative reports, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall,
by motion make the following findings in deciding on the conditional use
application:
            1.   The proposed conditional use is to be located in a district
wherein such use may be conditionally permitted;
            2.   The proposed conditional use will not have a substantial or
material detrimental effect on surrounding properties and will not have a
substantially negative impact on, or substantially conflict with surrounding
properties; and
            3.   Taking into account current vehicular traffic volumes and
traffic volumes as may be expected to increase with increasing development of
the community, and taking into account vehicular turning movements in relation
to routes of traffic flow, street intersections, sight distances and pedestrian
traffic, whether the vehicular traffic to and from the conditional use can be
accommodated by the existing street network without significant adverse effect
to the areas immediately surrounding the conditional use.
         (e)   Performance bond and violation. In approving a conditional use,
the Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards
in conformity to the provisions of this Zoning Code. The Board of Zoning
Appeals may also require security to assure conformance to such conditions and
safeguards. Violation of such conditions and safeguards shall cause the
security to be forfeited and shall also be deemed a violation of this code and
punishable under §
158.999(A), as well as loss of the right to continue the conditional use until
the requirements of these conditions and safeguards are met. An approved
conditional use shall maintain the status of a conditional use regardless of
the type of zoning district in which it is located.
         (f)   Burden of proof. The applicant shall have the burden of proving
by a preponderance of evidence that the standards set forth in subsection (6)
(d) of this section are met and the conditional use may be approved only if the
Board of Zoning Appeals finds the standards have been met by such evidence.
         (g)   Effect of approval. The effect of the Board's approval of a
conditional use application is authorization for the Planning and Development
Department to allow a specific conditional use for that property. The decision
of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be final unless appealed to City Council
pursuant to division (E) of this section.
         (h)   Period of validity. A conditional use approval shall expire two
years after it is approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless actual
construction has taken place or is underway or actual occupancy has occurred
except as provided elsewhere in this Zoning Code. If a conditional use is
approved, the plan must be followed. Any deviation requires the resubmission of
an application for approval of the conditional use.
   (I)   Effective date. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall make specific
findings of fact upon which it bases its order or decision. The Board's order
shall become effective upon approval of the issue by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.

are proposed, as described in the certification to local officials by the
Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation or affecting any land within
a radius of 500 feet from the point of intersection of the centerline with any
public road or highway, the Planning and Zoning Department shall give notice by
certified mail to the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation. The
Planning and Zoning Department shall not issue a zoning permit for 120 days

and eliminate illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4. This
program shall include the mapping of the MS4, including MS4 outfalls and home

regulation, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of an
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
regulation or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the public, health,
safety, and welfare, the City of Beavercreek may seek issuance of a search
warrant, civil remedies including but not limited to injunctive relief, and/or
criminal remedies from any court of appropriate jurisdiction.

remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise
that, should the facility owner/operator fail to remediate or restore within
the established deadline, a legal action for enforcement may be initiated.
   (C)   Any person receiving a notice of violation must meet compliance
standards within the time established in the notice of violation.
