meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a
whole.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divided a state into not more than 2 parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the state.

§ 30.02 RULES OF COUNCIL.
   Except as otherwise provided by law or specifically waived by the Council,
the proceedings of Council shall be governed by the rules set forth in this
chapter.
(1959 Code, § 111.02)
§ 30.03 RULE 1 - PRESIDENT PRO TEM AND CLERK; DUTIES OF CLERK.
   (A)   The members of council shall, within 10 days from the commencement of
their term, organize by the election of a president pro tem and clerk.
   (B)   The president pro tem shall preside in the absence of the mayor, or
president of council, whichever may be the presiding officer.
   (C)   The clerk of council shall attend all meetings, regular and special;
record all proceedings in the minutes; prepare an agenda for every meeting;
attend to all correspondence incidental to his office; attend to the
codification of the ordinances, according to the system employed by the city;
and perform such other duties as may be assigned to him by a majority vote of
council, or as are required by law.
(`59 Code, § 111.03)
§ 30.04 RULE 2 - QUORUM.
   A majority of all the members elected shall be a quorum, but a less number
may adjourn from day to day and compel the attendance of absent members in such
manner and under such penalties as are prescribed by ordinance.
(`59 Code, § 111.04)
§ 30.05 RULE 3 - COUNCIL MAY DETERMINE OWN RULES; EXPULSION OF MEMBERS; ABSENCE
FROM MEETINGS.
   (A)   Council shall determine its own rules and keep a journal of its
proceedings. It may punish or expel any member for disorderly conduct in
council or a violation of its rules, and declare his seat vacant for absence
without valid excuse where such absence has continued for 2 months. No
expulsion shall take place without the concurrence of 2/3 of all the members
elected, and until the delinquent member has been notified of the charge
against him and has had an opportunity to be heard.
   (B)   When some member of council may be unable to attend meetings, by
reason of illness, vacations, absence from the city, or for other reasons, and
if the absent member is absent for just cause, a motion should be passed and
entered on the minutes, excusing such member. The seat of a member will be
declared vacant after 2 absences without cause.
(`59 Code, § 111.05)
§ 30.06 RULE 4 - MAYOR, DUTIES; REPORT TO COUNCIL; RECOMMENDATIONS.
   (A)   The mayor shall attend council meetings when specifically requested by
council, and shall answer questions put to him. He shall make such
recommendations, in writing, to council for the welfare of the city as seem
wise to him. At the first regular meeting in January of each year, he shall
report to council concerning the affairs of the city.
   (B)   Recommendations by the mayor shall be made in writing when possible,
for study by council and committees. ('59 Code, § 111.06)
§ 30.07 RULE 5 - PRESIDENT OF COUNCIL; PRESIDING OFFICER.
   (A)   The president of council shall preside at all regular and special
meetings of council, but he shall have no vote except in case of a tie.
   (B)   The presiding officer shall call the meeting to order at the appointed
time, and announce the business before council in its proper order, and state
and put all questions properly brought before council. He shall, in common with
any other member, call any member who shall violate any of the rules; and
shall, when in the chair, decide all questions of order, subject to an appeal
to the council, on demand of the member on which appeal there shall be no
debate, but the member making the appeal may briefly state his reasons for the
same.
   (C)   The presiding officer shall avoid any appearance of partisanship on
any question. His function is solely to see that the business properly brought
before council is conducted in an orderly manner, and that the members of
council observe the rules of procedure adopted by council.
   (D)   In the absence of the president of council, the president pro tem
shall preside.
   (E)   In the absence of the president of council and president pro tem, the
members of council present shall elect one member of council as the presiding
officer for that meeting.
(Ord. 31-1971, passed 7-6-71)
§ 30.08 RULE 6 - SCHEDULE OF BUSINESS.
   Each meeting of council shall be opened with a prayer which shall precede
the order business. The schedule of business for conducting meetings of council
shall be as follows:
   (A)   Roll call. Roll call of members to determine if a quorum is present.
Absent councilmen should be excused by motion, for cause.
   (B)   Minutes. Reading and approval of the minutes of the previous meeting,
and correction of errors of omission or commission therein, if there are any.
   (C)   Introduction of persons appearing before council. Introduction of
delegations or citizens wishing to appear before council.
   (D)   Reports from the mayor, safety-service director, city auditor,
treasurer, director of law, and other public officials. The report of the
mayor, auditor, and treasurer should be in writing, and any other reports from
public officials should also, whenever possible, be in writing.
   (E)   Reading of communications. Should any communication call for council
action which cannot be immediately taken, it should be referred to the
appropriate committee by the presiding officer. Should there be any question
about the committee to which any matter should be referred, council can, by
majority vote, refer the matter to any committee.
   (F)   Second reading of ordinances and resolutions.
   (G)   Third reading of ordinances and resolutions and disposition thereof.
   (H)   Reports of committees. Since most matters coming before council
require some investigation and study, the council shall refer such items to
committees for investigation and report. The committees may then call meetings
of their members and make such investigation as they deem necessary.
      (1)   In writing. Reports of committees should be in writing and signed
by a majority of the members of the committees. Three is the usual number
appointed to comprise a committee. Minority reports may also be presented, if
desired, either written or oral.
      (2)   Standing committees. Standing committees are those which are
permanent in their functions, but they may have a change in membership from one
council to the next. (See §
30.30 for the standing committees of council.)
      (3)   Contents of reports. All petitions, ordinances, and resolutions
presented to council shall be referred to the proper committee, for study and
report. A committee report may include therein recommendations for approval of
a number of items, including approval of the ordinances or resolutions which
deal with the matters referred to the committee. Since it is possible that some
members of council may approve of some items and disapprove of others, at the
request of any member of council, a separate vote shall be taken on each item
presented by the committee report.
      (4)   Legislation referred to committee.
         (a)   When ordinances and resolutions are to be prepared, council
shall, by majority vote, request their preparation by the director of law. When
they are prepared, they shall be referred to the committee concerned with the
subject matter of the ordinance or resolution. The committee will then report
out the ordinance or resolution at the next council meeting.
         (b)   Council may accept or reject any committee report, in whole or
part. The director of law has the responsibility of preparing legislation in
the manner prescribed by law. The committees to which legislation is referred
shall not concern themselves with the fulfillment of legal requirements. They
will only determine whether the subject matter has been fully covered. For
instance, the finance committee may request that certain salary increases be
granted. Council may approve such request and vote to have the director of law
prepare the legislation needed to effect such increase. The legislation would
be referred to the finance committee to determine whether all the approved
increases are included.
      (5)   Preparation of legislation and reading.
         (a)   The Director of Law shall be given requests for legislation in
writing not later than the Friday preceding the Council meeting at which the
proposed legislation will be first considered. The legislation, as prepared by
the Director of Law, will be distributed to each member of Council, and to the
Mayor, Auditor, and Director of Public Service and Safety on or before the day
proceeding the Council meeting at which the legislation will be considered.
When the legislation is presented for reading in accordance with divisions (H)
(8) and (H)(9), the title shall be read and the content of the legislation
summarized. Legislation shall not be read in full unless requested to be so
read by any Councilmember present at the meeting. The Clerk of Council shall
ascertain that all members of Council present have read the legislation to be
considered, and a vote on a suspension of the rules shall be taken by ayes and
nays separately on each bylaw, resolution or ordinance. The Clerk shall enter
such vote on the journal or minute book together with the names of the members
so voting.
         (b)   If all members present affirm that they have read the
legislation to be considered, and 3/4 of Council vote on suspension, the Clerk
shall ask if any Councilmember present at the meeting desires that the
legislation be read in full. (Ord. 16-1990, passed 3-27-90)
         (c)   If no requests are so made, the legislation will be summarized
by the person or committee presenting the same for passage, the title shall be
read, and the clerk shall reflect the reading of the legislation and record on
the minutes or journal that the legislation was placed on first reading.
      (6)   Voting on legislation. Ordinances and resolutions shall always be
voted upon separately, even though the committee report urging approval of such
legislation may be adopted unanimously. The voting on such legislation shall be
entered by the clerk in writing in the minutes as "aye" and "nay," together
with the names of members of council voting "aye" and those voting "nay."
      (7)   Seconding of motions. Each motion shall be seconded before further
action thereon.
      (8)   First reading of ordinances; resolutions. When committees report
out ordinances, these can be set aside and given a first reading at the end of
committee reports. Thus, all ordinances will be given a first reading at one
time. Resolutions, unless permanent in nature, may be voted upon immediately,
or acted upon at the same time as the ordinances.
      (9)   Second reading of ordinances; emergency ordinances. When an
ordinance is presented, it shall be read by the clerk, and, if it is not an
emergency ordinance, it should be set aside for second reading at the next
meeting. If it is an emergency ordinance, requiring immediate action, the
presiding officer should, after it is read by the clerk, entertain a motion to
suspend the rules and read the ordinance by its title only for the second and
third readings. If 3/4 of the members approve the motion, the clerk will then
read the ordinance by its title only for the second and third readings. The
ordinance is then ready for passage. After a member moves for passage, a vote
will be taken. If a majority approves the passage of the ordinance, it shall be
signed by the clerk and presiding officer and sent to the mayor for his
signature.
      (10)   Clerk to enter vote in the minutes. The clerk shall enter in the
minutes the vote on all ordinances and resolutions, together with the names of
those voting "aye" and those voting "nay."
(`59 Code, § 111.08)
§ 30.09 RULE 7 - CONDUCTING DISCUSSIONS.
   No member shall speak more than once upon any subject, until every member
choosing to speak shall have had an opportunity to be heard, nor more than
twice upon any subject, nor for a time longer than 5 minutes, without leave of
council upon a majority vote.
(`59 Code, § 111.09)
§ 30.10 RULE 8 - AGENDA OF MEETING.
   (A)   The clerk shall prepare an agenda, or schedule of matters to be
brought before council.
   (B)   Any persons, group, or delegation wishing to appear before council
shall direct a letter to the clerk in such time that he will receive it, but
not less than 24 hours before the time of the council meeting. The letter
should clearly state the purpose of the appearance, and the approximate number
who will appear in the group.
   (C)   Chairmen of committees who are to report at the next meeting shall
furnish the clerk a written copy of the report to be made, at least 24 hours
before the time of the next meeting. The clerk shall also be notified of
ordinances and resolutions to be presented, and any member of council who
wishes to bring a matter before the body, other than a committee report, should
likewise notify the clerk of the nature of the matter.
('59 Code, § 111.10)
§ 30.11 RULE 9 - APPOINTMENT TO COMMITTEES.
   All appointments of committees, except such as are permitted by law to
certain officials, shall be subject to the approval of a majority of council.
('59 Code, § 111.11)
§ 30.12 RULE 10 - EMERGENCY LEGISLATION.
   All legislation passed as emergency legislation must state the reason for
the emergency, and not in the mere general terms that such action is "necessary
for the peace, health, welfare, and safety of the city."
('59 Code, § 111.12)
§ 30.13 RULE 11 - RECEIVING MOTION WHEN QUESTION IS BEFORE COUNCIL.
   (A)   When a question or a proposition is before the council or under
debate, or when a motion has been made, no motions shall be received except the
following:
      (1)   To adjourn.
      (2)   To table the motion - lay it aside until later.
      (3)   To request that discussion end, and that any motion being

      (5)   To refer the proposal to a standing or special committee.
      (6)   To amend the main motion.
      (7)   To postpone any action for an indefinite time.
   (B)   These motions shall have precedence in the order in which they are
arranged. Motions listed as (1), (2), and (3) above shall be decided without
debate. ('59 Code, § 111.13)
§ 30.14 RULE 12 - HANDLING MOTIONS FOR REFERENCE TO COMMITTEE.
   When a motion is made for reference of any subject to a standing committee,
and it is moved to substitute therefor a select or special committee, the
question of reference to a standing committee shall be put first.
('59 Code, § 111.14)
§ 30.15 RULE 13 - MOTIONS TO RECONSIDER.
   (A)   A motion to reconsider a subject that may have been acted upon
favorably must be made before adjournment of that session of council. A motion
to reconsider any other subject may be made not later than the next regular
meeting after such action was taken. A motion to reconsider may be made only by
any member who voted with the winning or prevailing side. A motion to
reconsider shall be in order at any time except when a motion on some other
subject is standing.
   (B)   A motion to reconsider, being laid on the table, may be taken up and
acted upon at any time when the council is engaged in the transaction of new or
miscellaneous business.
   (C)   No motion to reconsider shall be made more than once on any matter or
subject, and the same number of votes shall be required to reconsider the
action of council, as was required to pass or adopt the same.
('59 Code, § 111.15)
§ 30.16 RULE 14 - MOTION TO TAKE FROM THE TABLE.
   A motion to take from the table shall be in order when that order of
business is being transacted in which such matter to be taken up was laid upon
the table, or under the head of new or miscellaneous business, and such motion
shall be decided without debate, provided the mover may be permitted to state
briefly his reasons for the motion.
('59 Code, § 111.16)
§ 30.17 RULE 15 - MOTION TO POSTPONE INDEFINITELY.
   If a motion to postpone indefinitely is carried, the principal question
shall be declared lost.
('59 Code, § 111.17)
§ 30.18 RULE 16 - MOTION FOR THE PREVIOUS QUESTION.
   (A)   The previous question shall be in the form, "Shall the main question
now be put?" It shall be admitted only when demanded by 2 members, and until
decided, shall preclude further debate and all amendments and motions. If the
previous question is demanded on an amendment, it shall apply only to the
amendment. If the motion for the previous question is carried, the question
shall be put without further debate.
   (B)   If the motion for the previous question is carried, but before it is
actually put in execution, the motion to which it is directed may be laid on
the table.
('59 Code, § 111.18)
§ 30.19 RULE 17 - MOTION TO AMEND.
   A motion to amend is susceptible of but one amendment thereof. An amendment

('59 Code, § 111.19)

dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings;
      (2)   The rights, reputation, and conduct of the members of the Council
individually, in their capacity as such members.
   (B)   A question of privilege shall have precedence of all questions except
a motion to adjourn.
§ 30.21 RULE 19 - MOTION THAT MATTER BE TAKEN FROM COMMITTEE.
   When any ordinance, resolution, petition or other matter has been referred
to a committee, and the committee to which such has been referred fails, within
a reasonable time, to report, or to offer a valid reason for its failure to
report, any member of Council shall have the right to make a motion that such
ordinance, resolution, petition, or matter be taken from the committee to which
such matter has been referred; and the same may be laid before Council for
action. This motion shall be decided without debate, provided that the member
making the motion may state his reasons briefly for the motion.
('59 Code, § 111.21)
§ 30.22 RULE 20 - MAJORITY, 2/3, AND 3/4 DEFINED.
   Whenever the term MAJORITY, is used herein, unless otherwise expressly
indicated, it shall be held to mean a majority of those elected to Council;

contained in §
30.23 above.

Purchasing Agent shall have authority to award the contract to one of the tie
bidders by drawing lots in public, or to purchase the commodities or
contractual services in the open market, provided the price paid in the open
market shall not exceed the lowest contract bid price submitted for the same

the lowest responsible bidder; quality offered, delivery terms and service
reputation of the vendor may be taken into consideration in determining the
successful bidder. It shall be the duty of the Purchasing Agent to discourage

provide that if and when such purchasers become part of the city, such rate of
service shall then be the same as for other inhabitants of the city.
         (d)   Contracts for water service outside the corporation limits shall
further provide as a part of the contract, and as an inducement for the city to
enter into the contract, a provision that the user shall agree to sign a
voluntary petition for annexation of their property to the city, at any and all
times as may be requested by the city while the contract is in effect. In the
event there is no written contract for water service between the city and the
user then the use of said water by said user and payment therefor shall operate
as the agreement and this section shall have the same effect as though there
were a written agreement. In the event the user fails or refuses to sign said
annexation petition upon request, then the city shall have the right to
discontinue water service to said user upon 30 days notice.
   (B)   Bills. The rates and charges as herein established shall be sent
monthly and be payable to the city on or before the fifteenth of the month in
which the bill was sent. If any charge for the services of the system shall not
be paid by the fifteenth day of the month in which it shall become due and
payable, a delayed payment charge of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the
bill shall be added thereto and collected therewith. The city may terminate
water service in accordance with its Utility Service Termination Policy for any
unpaid water service charges more than 30 days delinquent. The failure to
receive a bill shall not relieve the consumer or customer of the responsibility
for payment.
   (C)   Special charges. The following charges shall be paid for the specified
special services furnished by the Water Department:
      (1)   Reads of meters are collected through the Meter Software System
(Analytics).
      (2)   Service charge for trip to discontinue or attempt to discontinue
water service due to non-payment of account arrearages - $75.00.
      (3)   Service charge of $50.00 plus cost of labor and equipment to
relocate, disconnect or reconnect metering system at the request of the
customer, with an exception where the service line is being capped and
abandoned.
      (4)   Service charge to turn on or off service at curb box or meter pit
at the request of the customer:
         (a)   During regular working hours - $25.00;
         (b)   After regular working hours - $150.00, except for an emergency
situation at the discretion of the Service Director.
      (5)   Ownership of meters.
         (a)   City of Logan shall supply and retain ownership of all meters
used on the city water system and may replace any existing meter that the city
deems necessary.
         (b)   Broken or damaged meters and/or meter pits will be repaired by
the city. However, the cost of such repairs shall be charged to the owner of
the property where the meter is located, with an exception of ordinary wear on
the meter as determined by the city.
         (c)   During regular working hours - $25.00, plus equipment cost.
         (d)   After regular working hours - $100.00, plus equipment cost.
         (e)   For a first-time occurrence if deemed accidental by the Water
Department - $25.00, plus one-half of the cost of equipment, and instruction
will be given on the care of the meter and/or meter pit.
      (6)   Service charge as a result of fraud or illegal diversion of water,
including unauthorized turn on or other violation of the rules and regulations
of the Service Director (plus estimated quantity of water used) - $150.00, plus
cost of labor and equipment.
      (7)   Meter testing.
         (a)   Meters may be tested at the discretion of the city or the
customer.
         (b)   Should any City of Logan customer with a one inch meter or
smaller request that his/her meter be tested for accuracy, such test will be
completed by the city and require a written request accompanied by a $50.00
deposit. If the customer's meter tests accurate by the same American Water
Works Association (AWWA) standards, then the meter will be reinstalled. If the
meter tested for accuracy does not meet AWWA water meter accuracy standards,
then there will be no charge to the customer, the deposit will be refunded, and
the city will replace the meter. Where meter is larger than one inch in
diameter and the customer disputes the accuracy of the meter, the test will be
the customer's responsibility. Customer shall have a certified meter testing
company approved by the city test the meter. If the meter so tested for
accuracy does not meet AWWA water meter accuracy standards, then the city will
replace the meter.
      (8)   Returned check or ACH (automated clearing house) processing charge
- $25.00.
      (9)   Adjustments of bill. Claims for allowances because of errors in
meter readings, faulty registration of meters, and clerical errors will be
allowed upon proper evidence, and the bill adjusted accordingly by the Service
Director.
      (10)   Water leak adjustments.
         (a)   If a customer experiences a water leak from a broken water pipe
that results in a dramatic increase in the customer's bill, the city may
consider an adjustment based upon such a request by the customer. A leak
adjustment application form shall be obtained at the city Water Department in
the municipal building. Proof of the leak is required, such as a plumber's
statement, inspection by a city official and/or other necessary documentation
to substantiate the problem. The highest consumption in the period the leak
occurred will be used as consideration for an adjustment, provided the customer
takes immediate action to correct the problem. No more than two consecutive
billing periods will be used for adjustment calculations. Leaking plumbing
fixtures and/or the carelessness of leaving water running through a spigot or
valve are not considered grounds for an adjustment.
         (b)   Upon satisfactory proof of the leak, the city may adjust the
customer's bill as follows:
            1.   The sewer portion shall be reduced to the monthly average of
the prior three sewer bills.
            2.   The water portion usually will not be waived because the city
has to pay for all water in the system. Should unusual circumstances or a
hardship be proven, the city may reduce the water bill to the average of the
previous usage, then all water usage above this monthly average of the prior
three water bills shall be paid for at the city's wholesale cost.
         (c)   All water that passes through a meter is the financial
responsibility of the customer. A water leak adjustment is not a customer's
right, but simply a method whereby the city recognizes that broken lines and
emergencies may be beyond the customer's control and can cause an undue
hardship. This policy is to assist the customer during this hardship. All
decisions for adjustments are strictly at the city's discretion and must be
considered final.
   (D)   Unpaid charges a lien - owner liable.
      (1)   Each water charge charged under or pursuant to Title 5, Logan City
Code, is made a lien upon the corresponding lot, parcel of land, building or
premises served by a connection to the water system of the city, and if the
same is not paid within 60 days after it becomes due and payable, it shall be
certified to the auditor of Hocking County, Ohio, who shall place the certified
amount on the real property tax list and duplicate of the property served by
the connection. A penalty charge of 10% on the amount that is due and payable
shall be added to the certified amount, plus an administrative charge for
handling of $50.00. The total certified amount shall be collected as other
taxes are collected. The city shall provide the owner of property with written
notice of the impending certification at least thirty (30) days prior to the
certification. For any procedure not specified in this section, refer to R.C. §
743.04.
      (2)   The city may also collect unpaid water charges by actions at law,
from an owner, tenant, or other person who is liable to pay the charges.
      (3)   The owners of real estate premises installing or maintaining water
service shall be liable for all water charges incurred for service at said
premises.
      (4)   The division will directly bill a tenant for water and sewer
service if the property owner, or authorized agent of the property owner, along
with the tenant, sign a written agreement authorizing direct billing of the
tenant. Once a written agreement is signed, the division will simultaneously
mail, to both the owner and the tenant, copies of any bills and notices
concerning delinquent water and sewer charges. This requirement shall affect
contracts made on or after the effective date of this division (D)(4).
      (5)   Direct billing of a tenant shall be in no way construed as to
relieve the owner of the real estate premises of liability for water and sewer
service charges. No direct billing of a tenant will be allowed where all
delinquent water and sewer charges are not paid in full up until the date the
direct billing agreement is accepted by the city, or where water or sewer
service has been terminated for real estate premises.
      (6)   The owner of real estate premises by installing or maintaining
water service from the city is deemed to assent to all rules and regulations of
the division of water and ordinances of the city pertaining to water service
and distribution.
   (E)   Hauling water. The city may sell water to private individuals for
hauling water to private sources at a rate set by the Director of Public
Service and Safety for each 1,000 gallons or part thereof, however,
arrangements must be made with the Water Superintendent to pick up water at a
given time and place. The Director of Public Service and Safety may refuse the
sale of such water at any time and for any reason.

   (F)   The Director of Public Service and Safety or his or her authorized
agent shall render bills for water service and all other charges in connection
therewith and shall collect all moneys due there from.
   (G)   All revenues and moneys derived from the operation of the water system
shall be paid to and heldby the city, separate and apart from all other funds
of the Municipality and all of such sums and all other funds and moneys
incident to the operation of the system, as may be delivered to the water
utility, shall be deposited in a separate fund designated the Waterworks Fund
Account and the Director of Public Service and Safety shall administer such
fund in every respect in a manner provided by the Ohio Revised Code and all
other laws pertaining thereto.

   (A)   On premises using water exclusively supplied by the city, and having a
water meter acceptable to the Service Director, the quantity of water used, as
measured by the meter, shall determine the sewer charge thereon, as provided
herein.
   (B)   On premises either using water exclusively supplied by the city or
exclusively supplied from other sources, where the quantity of water used
thereon is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a water meter not
acceptable to the Service Director, the owner or other interested party shall
at his expense install and maintain a water meter acceptable to the Service
Director, and the quantity of water used, as measured by the meter, shall
determine the sewer charge thereon, as provided herein.
   (C)   On premises using water supplied both by the city and from other
sources, which in either case is not measured by a water meter or is measured
by a water meter not acceptable to the Service Director, the owner or other
interested party shall at his expense install and maintain water meters
satisfactory to the Service Director to measure all such supplies of water, and
the quantity of water used to determine the sewer charge thereon shall be the
sum of the quantities of water measured by the several meters, as provided
herein.
   (D)   In the event it can be shown, to the satisfaction of the Service
Director, with respect to any premises, that a portion of the water from any
source used thereon does not and cannot enter the sewerage system, then in each
such case, the owner or other interested party may at his expense install and
maintain separate water meters where necessary so as to show to the
satisfaction of the Service Director that portion of the water used which is
discharged into the system, and the quantity of water used, as measured by such
meter or meters showing discharge into the system, shall determine the sewer
charge thereon, as provided herein.

§ 54.02 PURPOSE.
   This chapter establishes a stormwater management user fee to fund and
support the city’s efforts to address the issues presented in the recital
provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase
II stormwater permit and required operation, maintenance and replacement costs.
The user fees include general public, (institutional, agency, federal, state
and local government and the like) and/or property owner user fees.
(Ord. 13-2014, passed 5-13-14)
§ 54.03 PROPERTY AFFECTED.
   Except as provided in this chapter, all SFR developed property, multi-family
residentially developed property and non-residential developed property located

§ 54.04 USER FEES ESTABLISHED.
   (A)   All owners or lessees of real property in the city shall be charged
for the use of the stormwater system based on an estimate of the amount of
stormwater and rate of flow of stormwater that is projected to discharge into
the city stormwater system from the property. No property shall be exempt from
this fee except those classified as vacant by the Hocking County Auditor with
Land Use Codes of 100, 300, 400 or 500. However, any property with measurable
impervious area within those classifications shall not be exempted from this
fee.
   (B)   By this chapter, which may be amended from time to time by resolution
of the Council, the city hereby sets and establishes a system of fees that is
intended to assess users their fair and equitable share of the costs for use of
the stormwater system for each property within the city. These fees shall be
established in an amount sufficient to defray the reasonable costs for federal
stormwater permit requirements, along with the operation, maintenance, and
construction of necessary improvements or additions to the stormwater system.
The subsequent amendments or adjustments shall take into consideration the
amount of funds reasonably necessary to meet the level and cost of service
required to manage and operate the stormwater system, including any previously
unforeseen inflationary pressures, system expansion, increases in state and
federal program mandates, or related issues that may necessitate management
program expansion.
   (C)   The stormwater user fee shall be a monthly service charge and shall be
determined by the provisions of this chapter and the applicable equivalent
residential unit (ERU) and ERU rate established hereunder, which provisions may
be amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions of this chapter
or by resolution of the Council.
   (D)   The Service Director shall make recommendations to the Council to
adjust this definition of ERU from time to time by resolution to reflect
development trends within the city or further equitably divide the costs of
supporting the operation and maintenance of the stormwater system. In adjusting
this definition, the Council shall take into consideration the source of the
data from which the subject ERU is to be established, the general acceptance
and use of the source on the part of other stormwater systems, and the
reliability and general accuracy of the source. The Council may also utilize
information obtained from property tax assessor's rolls or site examination,
mapping information, aerial photographs, and other reliable information in
order to determine impervious surface areas.
      (1)   SFR developed properties shall be billed on a per unit basis at one
ERU per month.
      (2)   Two family residential developed properties shall be billed one ERU
per water meter per month.
      (3)   Condominium developed properties with individual lot numbers shall
be billed on a per unit basis at one ERU per month.
      (4)   Other multi-family residentially developed properties and non-
residential developed properties shall be billed on an ERU calculation which is
a quotient, the numerator of which is the total impervious area of the
property, and the denominator of which is the then-effective average impervious
area for an ERU. The impervious area estimate shall be based on ortho-rectified
aerial photography and/or as-built plans as approved through the building
permit process, or other sources at the discretion of the Service Director.
      (5)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the STWUD
shall access the need for rate increases and report findings to the Council.
   (E)   The user fee established pursuant to this Chapter 54 shall be payable
as provided herein, and in the amount which is determined as follows. The
billing rate per month for an ERU shall be:
 
1 ERU     $3.00 per ERU
2-10 ERU  $2.50 per ERU
11-49 ERU $2.00 per ERU
>49 ERU   $1.50 per ERU
 
   (F)   Rates and charges incurred under this section shall be prepared and
collected by the city in accordance with those provisions regulating the
preparation and issuance of bills for utility service. The monies collected
under this section shall be used expressly for the benefit of the stormwater
system.

§ 54.05 COLLECTION.
   (A)   The billing and collection of stormwater user fees shall be
administered by the City Utilities Billing Office. The stormwater user fees for
SFR developed property, multi-family residentially developed property and non-
residential developed properties shall be billed monthly with payment due as of
the date stated in the billing.
   (B)   For billing and collections administered directly by the city, in the
event a partial payment is received, the payment shall be applied pro-rata to
each account billed on a consolidated statement by city services in the
proportion that the account bears to the total consolidated statement of all
current charges for all accounts. All bills for stormwater user fees shall

      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
is permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         (a)   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         (b)   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   (a)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless

is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)
(3) of this section.
         (b)   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (D)   Flashing green signal indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (E)   Flashing yellow signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (H)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

§ 70.22 SIGNALS OVER REVERSIBLE LANES.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (A)   A steady downward green arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (B)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (D)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (E)   A steady red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

§ 70.23 PEDESTRIAN-CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian signals exhibiting the words “walk” or “don’t
walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in place, such
signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (A)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (B)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (C)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (E)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

§ 70.27 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (A)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (B)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have “stop” or “yield” signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this division (B) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (D)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

§ 70.28 DRIVER’S DUTIES UPON APPROACHING AMBIGUOUS OR NON-WORKING TRAFFIC
SIGNAL.
   (A)   The driver of a vehicle who approaches an intersection where traffic
is controlled by traffic control signals shall do all of the following if the
signal facing the driver exhibits no colored lights or colored lighted arrows,
exhibits a combination of such lights or arrows that fails to clearly indicate
the assignment of right-of-way, or, if the vehicle is a bicycle or an electric
bicycle, the signals are otherwise malfunctioning due to the failure of a
vehicle detector to detect the presence of the bicycle or electric bicycle:
      (1)   Stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, stop before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, stop
before entering the intersection;
      (2)   Yield the right-of-way to all vehicles in the intersection or
approaching on an intersecting road, if the vehicles will constitute an
immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across or within the
intersection or junction of roadways;
      (3)   Exercise ordinary care while proceeding through the intersection.
   (B)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one

4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the person

evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to

has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of

arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that

      (6)   A physician or chiropractor who issues an affidavit for the
purposes of division (C)(3) or (C)(4) of this section is immune from civil

record subject to inspection or copying under R.C. § 149.43.
   (D)   Officers not permitted to stop cars to determine violation.
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law enforcement
officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on any street
or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of determining whether a
violation of division (B) of this section has been or is being committed or for
the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for such a violation
or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for such a
violation. No law enforcement officer shall view the interior or visually
inspect any automobile being operated on any street or highway for the sole
purpose of determining whether such a violation has been or is being committed.

the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (B)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non- economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action
that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.
Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         (a)   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         (b)   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         (c)   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (G)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (B)(1) of this section shall be fined

offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (E)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar

consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of §
73.012, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
person submits to the test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a

initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of

enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent

the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (K) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that That
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged

alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (M)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of §
73.012, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who
is asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests
under this section, and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance that the test results indicate is present in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (N)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (O)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197 relative to any
suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the

license or permit or nonresident operating privilege under this section for the
period of time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) is effective immediately
from the time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension
upon the arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty
of the charge that resulted in the person being requested to take, or in the
person taking, the chemical test or tests under division (I) of this section
does not affect the suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §
73.012 or R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
regardless of whether the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. §
4511.191(B) or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the

section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of §
73.01(A) or (B) or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the penalties
and sanctions provided in R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) through (G)(1)(b)(v).
         (c)   Except as otherwise provided in division (A)(1)(e) of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of §

      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
§
73.01(A) and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the driver’s or
occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege
suspended under this section or R.C. § 4511.19 as a result of the conviction or
guilty plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in R.C. § 4511.191(F)(2).
      (3)   (a)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under R.C. §
4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) or (ii) or (G)(1)(c)(i) or (ii) and if, within 60 days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in R.C. § 4511.19(G)(3) that
includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.
         (b)   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by

must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under R.C. § 4503.231, except as provided in

to or independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine
the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the
National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so imposed
shall be distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (A)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

      (3)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

nonresident operating privilege is suspended under this section or R.C. §
4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of the person’s trial or sentence,
the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.

in the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (G)   All terms defined in R.C. § 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in R.C. §4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of the

highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good cause
shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 through

vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the

section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
   (I)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

the entire vehicle being weighed.
   (D)   Whenever the officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines
that the weight is unlawful, he may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a
suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed as
is necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted under
R.C. §§ 5577.01 through 5577.14, and this chapter.

      (4)   The running at large of any animal specified in division (A)(1) of

form that complies with division (B)(7) of this section and that attests that

   (C)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         (a)   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         (b)   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (C). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (B)(4) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of
whether the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather
than a dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be
required to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the
Ohio Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog,
as applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the
pendency of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (C), or on
appeal as described in this division (C), to be a vicious dog, R.C. 955.11(D)
and divisions (B)(4) to (B)(9) of this section apply with respect to the dog
and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous
dog, and §
90.17 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (B)(5)(a) in an amount
described in division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (C), NUISANCE DOG, DANGEROUS DOG, and
VICIOUS DOG have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.

this section, if a violation of division (B)(3) of this section involves a

§ 99.01 AUTHORITY TO LEVY TAX; PURPOSES OF TAX; RATE.
   (A)   Authority to levy tax.
      (1)   The tax on income and the withholding tax established by this
Chapter 99 are authorized by Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution.
The tax on income and the withholding tax established by this
Chapter 99 are deemed to be levied in accordance with, and to be consistent
with, the provisions and limitations of R.C. Chapter 718. This chapter is
deemed to incorporate the provisions of R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The tax is an annual tax levied on the income of every person
residing in or earning or receiving income in the municipal corporation, and
shall be measured by municipal taxable income. The municipality shall tax
income at a uniform rate. The tax is levied on municipal taxable income, as
defined herein.
   (B)   Purposes of tax; rate. To provide funds for the purpose of general
municipal operations; maintenance of equipment; new equipment; extension,
enlargement, and improvement of municipal services and facilities; and capital
improvements of the city, there is levied a tax at the rate of 2% upon
municipal taxable income.
   (C)   Allocation of funds. The funds collected under the provisions of this
chapter shall be deposited in the treasury of the city to the credit of the
Income Tax Fund. The funds shall be disbursed in the following order, to wit:
      (1)   Such part thereof as shall be necessary to defray all costs of
collecting the taxes and the cost of administering and enforcing the provisions
thereof.
      (2)   Not more than 90% of net available income tax receipts received
annually shall be used to defray operating expenses of the city.
      (3)   At least 10% of net available income tax receipts received annually
shall be set aside and used for capital improvements for the city including,
but not limited to, development and construction of storm sewers and street
improvements; for public buildings, parks and playgrounds; and for equipment
necessary for the Police, Fire, Street, Traffic and Safety Departments.
   (D)   Statement of procedural history; state mandated changes to municipal
income tax.
      (1)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to R.C. Chapter 718 were
enacted by Am Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by
Governor Kasich on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal
corporations to conform to and adopt the provisions of R.C. Chapter 718 in
order to have the authority to impose, enforce, administer and collect a
municipal income tax.
      (2)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 31-2015,
effective January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends Chapter 99 in accordance with
the provisions of R.C. Chapter 718 to allow the municipality to continue the
income tax and withholding tax administration and collection efforts on behalf
of the municipality.

changes to R.C. Chapter 718, apply to municipal taxable years beginning on or
after January 1, 2016. All provisions of this Chapter 99 apply to taxable years
beginning 2016 and succeeding taxable years.
   (B)   Ordinance 31-2015 does not repeal the existing sections of Chapter 99
for any taxable year prior to 2016, but rather amends Chapter 99 effective
January 1, 2016. For municipal taxable years beginning before January 1, 2016,
the municipality shall continue to administer, audit, and enforce the income
tax of the municipality under R.C. Chapter 718 and ordinances and resolutions
of the municipality as that chapter and those ordinances and resolutions
existed before January 1, 2016.

§ 99.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code. For purposes of this section, the singular shall include the plural, and
the masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral. As used in
this chapter:
   ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME. For a person required to file as a C
corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under the definition of net profit, division (4) in this section, means a C
corporation's federal taxable income before net operating losses and special
deductions as determined under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income;
      (2)   Add an amount equal to 5% of intangible income deducted under
division (1) of this definition, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in § 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in §§ 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue
Code;
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (4)(b) of this definition,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in §§ 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (b)   Division (4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent the
income or gain is income or gain described in §§ 1245 or 1250 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;

computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under R.C. § 4313.02;
      (8)   (a)   Except as limited by divisions (8)(b), (c) and (d) of this
definition, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017. The amount of such net operating
loss shall be deducted from net profit that is reduced by exempt income to the
extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable income to zero, with any remaining
unused portion of the net operating loss carried forward to not more than five
consecutive taxable years following the taxable year in which the loss was
incurred, but in no case for more years than necessary for the deduction to be
fully utilized.
         (b)   No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (8) of
this definition to offset qualifying wages.
         (c)   1.   For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, or
2022, a person may not deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a
municipal corporation that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, more
than 50% of the amount of the deduction otherwise allowed by division (8)(a) of
this definition.
            2.   For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a person
may deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a municipal corporation
that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, the full amount allowed by
division (8)(a) of this definition.
         (d)   Any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward deduction that is
available must be utilized before a taxpayer may deduct any amount pursuant to
division (8) of this definition.
         (e)   Nothing in division (8)(c)1. of this definition precludes a
person from carrying forward, for use with respect to any return filed for a
taxable year beginning after 2018, any amount of net operating loss that was
not fully utilized by operation of division (8)(c)1. of this definition. To the
extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully utilized in one
or more taxable years by operation of division (8)(c)1. of this definition is
carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable year
beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in division
(8)(c)1. of this definition shall apply to the amount carried forward.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with §
99.06(C)(5)(c)2. of this chapter.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with §
99.06(C)(5)(c)2. of this chapter.
      (11)   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded
entity that has made the election described in the definition of taxpayer,
division (2) in this section, is not a publicly traded partnership that has
made the election described in the definition of net profit, division (4) in
this section, and is not an individual, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted
federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under § 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury
regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement
plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
      (12)   Nothing in this definition shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.

         (b)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division
(A)(1)(a) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
may also deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the
municipal corporation in which the employee is a resident.
      (2)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (A)(2)(b) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded
$2,399, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the municipality in any month of the
preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200. Payment under division (A)(2)(b) of
this section shall be made so that the payment is received by the Tax
Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under §
99.09(A) of this chapter.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator
listing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from
whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities
are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or
gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the
customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the
customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other
electronic means.
      (11)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.
   (B)   Collection at source; occasional entrant.
      (1)   The following terms as used in this section:
         (a)   "Employer" includes a person that is a related member to or of
an employer.
         (b)   "Professional athlete" means an athlete who performs services in
a professional athletic event for wages or other remuneration.

events, for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis.
         (e)   "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in
this state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned
or controlled by an employer.
         (f)   "Worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for more than 20
days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not include the home of
an employee.
         (g)   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
            1.   If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (B)(2)(a)1. of this section among those
two or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair
and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            2.   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(B)(2)(b) of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for
"municipal corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that
division.
      (2)   (a)   Subject to divisions (B)(3), (5), and (6) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of
the following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
municipality.
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the municipality. For the purposes of this division,
"presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this state at which the employer provides services that can
reasonably be expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a calendar
year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last more than 20
days" if either of the following applies at the time the services commence:
               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of actual services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than 20 days.
            3.   The employee is a resident of the municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in §
99.05(A) of this chapter.
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the municipality.
         (b)   For the purposes of division (B)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a
municipal corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services
for or on behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any
other municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the
amount of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent
performing one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have
been spent at the employee's principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            4.    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(b)3. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(2)(a) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day threshold
described in division (B)(2)(a) of this section, the employer shall withhold
and remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (B)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax
for that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
         (c)   If an employer makes the election described in division (B)(4)
(b) of this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during
those first 20 days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
      (5)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in §
99.03 of this chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (B)(2)(a) and (B)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of §
99.05(A) of this chapter.
   (C)   Collection at source; casino and VLT.
      (1)   The municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in § 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and R.C. §
3772.01, respectively, or a lottery sales agent conducting video lottery
terminals sales on behalf of the state to withhold and remit municipal income
tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages as provided in this
section.
      (2)   If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by § 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct and
withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the tax
imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located.
      (3)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in
trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
         (a)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator
shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
         (b)   Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If
the name, address, or social security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
         (c)   Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The Administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
         (d)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
         (e)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise
quits the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any
penalties and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor
shall withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
            1.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
            2.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
         (f)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
      (4)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an
amount for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by §
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent
shall deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at
the rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video
lottery terminal facility is located.
      (5)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are
held in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is
owed.
         (a)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
         (b)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery
sales agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of
the municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of
the persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the
amount of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar
month, the amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld,
and any other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return,
the video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax
Administrator all amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
         (c)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (C)(5) of this section and shall make those
records available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with R.C. § 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
         (d)   Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
         (e)   Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, a video lottery
sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with respect to
whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income
tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video lottery
sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent shall
provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of each
information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
         (f)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (6)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
      (7)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold
the required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person
from liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
      (8)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
         (a)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted
and withheld under this section, a penalty equal to 50% of the tax deducted and
withheld;
         (b)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or
annual return, a penalty of $500 for each return not filed or filed late.
Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at the rate
prescribed in R.C. § 5703.47.
      (9)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of §
99.07 of this chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
      (10)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts
and returns required under this section.

§ 99.06 INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX.
   (A)   Determining municipal taxable income for taxpayers who are not
individuals.
      (1)   "Municipal taxable income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual
for the municipality is calculated as follows:
      (2)   "Income" reduced by "exempt income" to the extent otherwise
included in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "pre-
2017 net operating loss carryforward" equals "municipal taxable income".
         (a)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "net
profit" of the taxpayer.
            1.   "Net profit" for a person other than an individual is defined
in §
99.03.
            2.   "Adjusted federal taxable income" is defined in §
99.03 of this chapter.
         (b)   "Exempt income" is defined in §
99.03 of this chapter.
         (c)    "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by §
99.06(B) of this chapter.
         (d)   "Pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward" is defined in §
99.03 of this chapter.
   (B)   Net profit; income subject to net profit tax; alternative
apportionment. This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides
in the municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company,
or telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under R.C.
Chapter 5745.
      (1)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used
in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall include
property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall
be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under §
99.05(B) of this chapter;
         (c)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)   If the apportionment factors described in division (B)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipality;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
99.19(A) of this chapter.
         (c)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(2)(a) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by §
99.19(A) of this chapter.
         (d)   Nothing in division (B)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (B)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         (a)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            1.   The employer;
            2.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            3.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described
in division (B)(3)(a)2. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
         (b)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (B)(3)(a) or (b) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (B)(1)(c) of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
         (a)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
            1.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
            2.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation
from a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
            3.   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal

of real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal
corporation in which the property generating the net profit is located and the

use separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(6)(b) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions

taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under the definition of income, division (12) and the definition of
qualifying wages, division (1)(d) of §
99.03 of this chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. This
division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the amount
of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal corporation
under this section.
      (8)   When calculating the ratios described in division (B)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (B)(2) of this section,

purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
         (d)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 4927.01.
         (e)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 5727.01.
      (2)   (a)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
            1.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
            2.   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (C)(2)(b) of this section; or
            3.   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
         (b)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (C)(2)(a) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
         (c)   An election made under division (C)(2)(a) or (b) of this section
is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (C)(5)(b), (c), and
(d) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax

for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that
division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C
corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
         (b)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under the definition of adjusted
federal taxable income in §
99.03 of this chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
         (c)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
            1.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
99.06(B) of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
            2.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
99.06(B) of this chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (d)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
            1.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in §
99.06(B) of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
            2.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (6)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make the computations required under §
99.06(B) of this chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
      (7)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with
this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation
is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of
such an affiliated group.
      (8)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
   (D)   Tax credit for businesses that foster new jobs in Ohio. The
municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit
against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding 15 years.
Before the municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit.
   (E)   Tax credits to foster job retention. The municipality, by ordinance,
may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit against its tax on income to a
taxpayer for the purpose of fostering job retention in the municipality. If a
credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured as a percentage of
the income tax revenue the municipality derives from the retained employees of
the taxpayer, and shall be for a term not exceeding 15 years. Before the
municipality passes an ordinance allowing such a credit, the municipality and
the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of the
credit.

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under §
99.09(A)(7) of this chapter or on or before the 15th day of the fourth month of
the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first
time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the 15th day of the sixth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;

(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month of the year following
that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid with the
return in accordance with §
99.09(A) of this chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to R.C. § 5747.08(G).
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the 15th day of the fourth month following the end of
the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to §
99.10 of this chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the

payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal
corporation under §
99.09(A) of this chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration

Statutory reference:
   Estimated taxes, see R.C. § 718.08
§ 99.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
   (A)   Credit for tax paid to another municipality. Every individual taxpayer
who resides in the city but who receives municipal taxable income outside of
the city, who has paid a municipal income tax on such municipal taxable income
to another municipality, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by
this chapter of the amount so paid by him or in his behalf to such other
municipality. The credit shall not exceed 1.5% of the tax assessed by this
chapter on such municipal taxable income. If the tax rate of the other
municipality or municipalities where tax was paid is less than 1.5%, the credit
shall not exceed the tax rate of the other municipality or municipalities.
   (B)   Refundable credit for qualifying loss.
      (1)   As used in this section:
         (a)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in § 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)   1.   Except as provided in division (B)(1)(b)2. of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
            2.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid
to one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount
of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (B)(1)(b)1. of this
section computed without regard to division (B)(1)(b)2. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            3.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal
corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan. If different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the
"qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The
weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
         (b)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section
from each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more
taxable years.
         (c)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal
corporation with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation
shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate
share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         (d)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   (a)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income
tax that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (b)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         (b)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
   (C)   Credit for person working in joint economic development district or
zone. A municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under R.C. § 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under R.C. §§ 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a
credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to §
99.08(A) of this chapter.
   (D)   Credit for tax beyond statute for obtaining refund.
      (1)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in §
99.09(F) of this chapter.
      (2)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in §
99.09(F), the municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
municipality claims is due. If the municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
      (3)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in §
99.09(F) of this chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in this section requires a municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
99.08(A) of this chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the municipality under §
99.05(A)(3) of this chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole

municipality.
         (c)   All resident individual taxpayers, 18 years of age and older,
shall file an annual municipal income tax return with the municipality,

individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
      (4)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary
shall provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to
support that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the
taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
      (5)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
      (6)   (a)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.

withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
         (c)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include,
with each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for
refund required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
         (d)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual
net profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some
other manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to
the Tax Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is
available, submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business
gateway or a portal provided by municipality. The department of taxation shall
publish a method of electronically submitting the documents required under this
division through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The
department shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this
division to the appropriate Tax Administrator.
         (e)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (f)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
      (7)   (a)   1.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under R.C. §
5747.08(G). The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms
prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the municipality or Tax Administrator.
            2.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the 15th day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and file
the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to the municipality or Tax
Administrator.
            3.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be
filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed
by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is $10 or less.
         (b)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the municipality in accordance with
this chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and
make payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers
not otherwise required to file annual returns.
         (c)   With respect to taxpayers to whom §
99.09(B) of this chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in §
99.09(B) of this chapter, the provision in §
99.09(B) of this chapter prevails.
      (8)   (a)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the municipality
shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the
amount due is $10 or less.
         (b)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (A)(8)(a) of this section shall file with the
municipality an annual net profit return under division (A)(6)(c) and (d) of
this section.
      (9)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (2)(a)2. of §
99.05(A) of this chapter.
         (a)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (b)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to
an account designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments,
except that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
      (10)   The amounts withheld for the municipality by an employer, the
agent of an employer, or other payer as described in §
99.05(A) of this chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
      (11)   Each return required by the municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
      (12)   The Tax Administrator of the municipality shall accept for filing
a generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
      (13)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
      (14)   (a)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in §
99.05(B) of this chapter.
         (b)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the
municipal corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the
person performed services at a worksite location within the municipal
corporation, and the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and
remitted all applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this
chapter. The Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a
taxpayer who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year. The person shall provide the notice in a
signed affidavit that briefly explains the person's circumstances, including
the location of the previous worksite location and the last date on which the
person performed services or made any sales within the municipal corporation.
The affidavit also shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no
plans to perform any services within the municipal corporation, make any sales
in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by
the municipal corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year,
the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a
taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by
the municipal corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
            3.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (A)(14)
(b) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file
any tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (A)(14) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from
performing an audit of the person.
   (B)   Return and payment of tax; individuals serving in combat zone.
      (1)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An
applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers
necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 180st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. Except as provided in division (B)(2)(c) of this section,
the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as the Tax
Administrator considers appropriate.
         (b)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the municipality before the 180st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
         (c)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division
(B)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not
require any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes
for the extension period.
      (3)   (a)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in
this division the application of divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this section.
         (b)   1.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (B)(3)(b)1. of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
            2.   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (B)(3)(b)1. of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (B)(3)(b)1. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
      (4)   For each taxable year to which division (B)(1), (2), or (3) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2)(b) and (2)(c)
or (B)(3) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer
if the filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly
for that year.
   (C)   Use of Ohio Business Gateway; types of filings authorized.
      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
      (4)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
      (5)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
   (D)   Extension of time to file.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for
a period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
      (3)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (4)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
      (5)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing state income tax returns under R.C. § 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
   (E)   Amended returns.
      (1)   (a)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's
annual return to determine the tax due levied by the municipality in accordance
with this chapter must be altered.
         (b)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is $10 or less.
         (c)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
      (2)   (a)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as provided
under division (E)(2)(a) of this section, the amended return shall not reopen
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed
return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment
to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the applicable
statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under §
99.19 of this chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
         (b)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
      (3)   (a)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by §
99.19(A)(2) of this chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed
beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is $10 or less, no
refund need be paid by the municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (E)(3)(b) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in §
99.09(F) of this chapter. Except as set forth in division (E)(3)(b) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
         (b)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (F)   Refunds.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of
the municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the municipality:
         (a)   Overpayments of more than $10;
         (b)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds $10.
      (2)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
         (b)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (F)
(2)(c) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
         (c)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
99.18 of this chapter.
      (3)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for
filing specified in division (F)(2) of this section shall be considered to have
been filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
         (a)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
         (b)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only
postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private
postal meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for
filing the request, and the request is received within seven days of such last
day.
         (c)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
      (4)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
99.10(A)(4) of this chapter.
      (5)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as
in §
99.10 of this chapter.

collected before January 1, 2016.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may, in the Tax Administrator's sole discretion,
abate or partially abate penalties or interest imposed under this section when

appropriate. Such abatement or partial abatement shall be properly documented
and maintained on the record of the taxpayer who received benefit of such
abatement or partial abatement.

§ 99.11 AUDIT.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, as defined in §
99.03 of this chapter, the Tax Administrator shall provide to the taxpayer a
written description of the roles of the Tax Administrator and of the taxpayer
during an audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights, including any right
to obtain a refund of an overpayment of tax. At or before the commencement of
an audit, the Tax Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is
considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer. A
taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting an
audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.

of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a

Administrator. The Tax Administrator has the authority to perform all duties
and functions necessary and appropriate to implement the provisions of this
chapter, including without limitation:
      (1)   Exercise all powers whatsoever of an inquisitorial nature as
provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths; provided that the

respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under a municipal corporation
income tax ordinance or resolution adopted in accordance with this chapter;
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)   Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)   Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax
Administrator's findings, and, if the Tax Administrator finds that there has
been an overpayment, approve and issue a refund payable to the taxpayer, the
taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as provided in this chapter;
      (5)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to
the compromise and settlement of tax claims;
      (6)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to the use of
alternative apportionment methods by taxpayers in accordance with §

      (7)   Make all tax findings, determinations, computations, assessments
and orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized and required to make and,
pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator's own
motion, review, redetermine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax
Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,
determination, computation, assessment or order which the Tax Administrator has
made for which an appeal has been filed with the Local Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in §
99.05(A) of this chapter.
   (B)   Authority of Tax Administrator; compromise of claim and payment over
time.
      (1)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount
payable to the municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax
imposed in accordance with this chapter.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the municipality:
         (a)   Compromise a claim;
         (b)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim
by agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
      (4)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
      (5)   (a)   A compromise or payment-over- time agreement with respect to
a claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or
agreement or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by
misrepresentation of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the
compromise or agreement and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties
or interest that would have accrued in the absence of the compromise or
agreement shall continue to accrue and be due.
         (b)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
      (6)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide
detailed financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether
or not a payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure
to provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator
shall preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
   (C)   Authority of Tax Administrator; right to examine.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
   (D)   Authority of Tax Administrator; requesting identifying information.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to §
99.10 of this chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in §
99.99 of this chapter.
         (b)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (D)(1) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to §
99.10 of this chapter.
         (c)   The penalties provided for under divisions (D)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in §
99.99 of this chapter for a violation of §
99.15 of this chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.

§ 99.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of §
99.15 of this chapter.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.

§ 99.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in R.C. § 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.

§ 99.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the
municipality. Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the municipality. This member may be an
employee of the municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The Board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in R.C. §
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the Board.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within 90 days after the Board's final hearing on
the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to all
of the parties to the appeal within 15 days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board's
final determination as provided in R.C. § 5717.011.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section R.C. §
149.43. For this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to R.C. §
121.22 . For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the public, and
only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.

§ 99.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in §
99.18 of this chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the 60th day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the 60th
day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board of Tax
Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed
and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.

of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in §
99.09(F) of this chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or

(Ord. 10-2018, passed 2-27-18)
§ 99.22 DEFINITIONS APPLICABLE ONLY TO §§ 99.21 TO 99.36.
   If a term used in §
99.06 of this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in
a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in R.C. Title LVII and the use is not consistent, then the use
of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
shall have control over the use of the term in R.C. Title LVII, unless the term
is defined in R.C. Chapter 5703, in which case the definition in that chapter
shall control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code
includes other laws of the United States related to federal income taxes. If a
term is defined in both this section and elsewhere in Chapter 99 of the
Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control for all uses
of that term in §
99.06 of this chapter. As used in §§
99.21 to
99.36 of this chapter only:
   (A)   MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME. Income apportioned or sitused to the

corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation as

the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable income before
net operating losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal
Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to 5% of intangible income deducted under
division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in § 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other

Code.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,

the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under R.C. § 4313.02.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with §
99.06(C)(5) of this chapter.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with §
99.06(C)(5) of this chapter.
   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in §
99.03 of this chapter, and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made

partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for
a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall
not be allowed as a deduction.
   Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)   TAXPAYER. Has the same meaning as in §
99.03 of this chapter, except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons

required to assume the role of a taxpayer.

during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of §§
99.21 to
99.36 of this chapter is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation
of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The Tax
Commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year
for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal income tax
purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for federal
income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new
taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.

   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the city and that has made the election under §
99.21 of this chapter.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the city during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
      As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the city to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under §
99.05(B) of this chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the city to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the city, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner may require, that
the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
99.17(A) of this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by §
99.17(A) of this chapter.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)   The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the city as
follows:

stock of goods located within the city.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the city from a location
outside the city, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the city and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
city to the extent that such services are performed in the city.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the city shall be sitused to the city.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the city shall be sitused to the city.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the city based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the city.
   (E)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the city in which
the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent or
broker shall be allocated to the city based upon the ratio of the commissions
the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
located in the city to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under the Codified Ordinances by the city or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to the city. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the city any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
   This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the city under this
section.
   (G)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
Commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)   An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax
Commissioner grants an extension of that date.

that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the Tax Commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in §
99.27 of this chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income"
for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that
division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C
corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under §
99.27(B) of this chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following with
respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
99.27 of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
99.27 of this chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in §
99.27 of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with §
99.06 of this chapter on the basis of the entity's net profits that would
otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under §
99.27 of this chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under §§
99.21 to
99.36 of this chapter or R.C. Chapter 5703 to the corporation, an affiliated
group of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year,
or any one or more members of such an affiliated group.

§ 99.28 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under §
99.21 of this chapter fails to pay any tax as required by the Codified
Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date prescribed for
its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in the same
manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum prescribed by
R.C. § 5703.47 from the date prescribed for its payment until it is paid or
until the date an assessment is issued under §
99.17 of this chapter, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 10-2018, passed 2-27-18)
§ 99.29 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least $200.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than 12 months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the Commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The Tax Commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the Tax Commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 67.5% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, 90% of the combined tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the Commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in R.C. §
718.85(B).
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
R.C. § 5703.47 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment,
unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E)
of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under §
99.06 of this chapter and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in accordance with R.C. § 718.83.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a municipal income tax return for
that year.
(Ord. 10-2018, passed 2-27-18)
§ 99.30 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by
Chapter 99 of the Codified Ordinances or R.C. Chapter 5703, the following
penalties shall apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under §
99.25 of this chapter fails to make and file the return within the time
prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the Tax Commissioner,
the Commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding $25 per month or fraction
of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the due
date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on which the return is
filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this division shall not
exceed $150.
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under §
99.26 of this chapter fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a penalty not
to exceed the following:
         (a)   For each of the first two failures, 5% of the amount required to
be reported on the return;
         (b)   For the third and any subsequent failure, 10% of the amount
required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under §
99.21 of this chapter fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid
under this chapter, the Commissioner may impose a penalty equal to 15% of the
amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by §
99.25 of this chapter that does not contain information upon which the
substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of §
99.06 of this chapter, a penalty of up to $500 may be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under §
99.25 of this chapter, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
$1,000 or 100% of the tax required to be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
§
99.25 of this chapter, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
$1,000 or 100% of the claim. Any penalty imposed under this division, any
refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund from the date of the
refund, may be assessed without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the Tax Commissioner. The Commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under §
99.06 of this chapter and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required
to be distributed to such municipal corporations under R.C. § 718.83.
(Ord. 10-2018, passed 2-27-18)
§ 99.31 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under §§
99.21 to
99.36 of this chapter fails to file the return within the time prescribed,
files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for
the period covered by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an assessment
against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the return or
tax is due, based upon any information in the Commissioner's possession.
   The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the Commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in §
99.31 of this chapter for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or
limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject
to assessment as required by §
99.25 of this chapter, or that files a fraudulent return. The Commissioner
shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided
in R.C. § 5703.37. With the notice, the Commissioner shall provide instructions
on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within 60
days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the Commissioner shall proceed under R.C. §
5703.60.
   (C)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the Tax
Commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax
Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from
the day the Commissioner issues the assessment until the assessment is paid or
until it is certified to the attorney general for collection under R.C. §
131.02, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is
certified to the attorney general for collection, the entire unpaid portion of
the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. §
5703.47 from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be
collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (D)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)   If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the Commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the Commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in R.C. § 5703.37
within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk. The total amount
assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer assessed files a
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of this section and
provides security in a form satisfactory to the Commissioner and in an amount
sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment. Full or partial
payment of the assessment does not prejudice the Commissioner's consideration
of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment, with interest on that amount as provided by that section.
(Ord. 10-2018, passed 2-27-18)
§ 99.32 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under §§
99.21 to
99.36 of this chapter, including assessments, shall be filed with the Tax
Commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or
excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period allowed by §
99.31(A) of this chapter. The application shall be filed in the form prescribed
by the Tax Commissioner.
   (B)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the Tax Commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the Commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in R.C. § 5703.052. If the amount is greater than $10 but less than
that claimed, the Commissioner shall proceed in accordance with R.C. § 5703.70.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the Commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under R.C. § 718.83.
   (C)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within 90 days after such determination shall bear interest
at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the ninety-first day
after such determination until the day the refund is paid or credited. On an
illegal or erroneous assessment, interest shall be paid at that rate from the
date of payment on the illegal or erroneous assessment until the day the refund
is paid or credited.
(Ord. 10-2018, passed 2-27-18)
§ 99.33 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under §
99.21 of this chapter and used to determine the tax due under §§
99.21 to
99.36 of this chapter must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the
internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax
liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
the Tax Commissioner in such form as the commissioner requires. The amended
return shall be filed not later than 60 days after the adjustment is agreed
upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes or after any federal
income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting
therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer
intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to
amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based
on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall
notify the Commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under §
99.31 of this chapter for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due under
this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest. The amended
return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from
a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that are not
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal tax return.
   (C)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the 60-day period prescribed for filing the amended
return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in §
99.33(A) of this chapter, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in §
99.33(A) of this chapter. The application shall not reopen those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return.
(Ord. 10-2018, passed 2-27-18)
§ 99.34 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)   The Tax Commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to §
99.06 of this chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return
made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under
those sections. Upon written request by the Commissioner or a duly authorized
agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this
section is required to furnish the opportunity for the Commissioner, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to §
99.06 of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Commissioner's inspection during
business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six years following the
end of the taxable year to which the records or documents relate, unless the
Commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or
by order requires that they be kept longer. The Commissioner may require any
person, by notice served on that person, to keep such records as the
Commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not that person is liable,
and the extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by a municipal
corporation.
   (C)   The Tax Commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
Commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

   (A)   A credit, granted by resolution or ordinance of the city shall be
available to a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under §
99.21 of this chapter, against the municipal corporation's tax on income. A
municipal corporation shall submit the following information to the Tax
Commissioner on or before the later of January 31, 2018, or the thirty-first

taxpayer's tax return, documentation issued by the city granting the credit
that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the credit, the amount of the
credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the tax year to which the credit
is to be applied.
      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
Tax Commissioner.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the Tax
Commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the city and taxpayer or to modify the terms or conditions of any such
existing agreement.

degree and shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment

   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the
aforesaid period are fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the

Revised Code or a division of a section of this code or the Revised Code shall
be construed to also refer to a previous conviction of or plea of guilty to a
substantially equivalent offense under an existing or former law of this
municipality, state, another state, or the United States or under an existing
or former municipal ordinance.
   (D)   Any provision of this Code that refers to a section, or to a division
of a section, of this Code that defines or specifies a criminal offense shall
be construed to also refer to an existing or former law of this state, another
state, or the United States, to an existing or former municipal ordinance, or
to an existing or former division of any such existing or former law or
ordinance that defines or specifies, or that defined or specified, a
substantially equivalent offense.

         (b)   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two

      (2)   As used in this division:
         (a)   The phrase OFFENSE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE MISCONDUCT IN
OFFICE OF A PUBLIC SERVANT includes, but is not limited to, a violation of R.C.
§ 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43(A)

misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any municipal
ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code sections listed
in this division (C)(2)(a).
         (b)   PUBLIC SERVANT has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2921.01.
   (D)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 of the Revised
Code is determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable
person and if the time of the determination is within 25 years after the
offense is committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section
may be commenced within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed
or five years after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, DNA RECORD has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (E)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (F)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (G)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (H)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (J)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Title or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (K)   As used in this section, PEACE OFFICER has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 2935.01.
   (L)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (A) and (D) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03
committed on and after July 16, 2015, and apply to a violation of either of
those sections committed prior to July 16, 2015, if prosecution for that
violation was not barred under this section as it existed on July 16, 2015.
      (2)   The amendment to division (A)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and
applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.
(R.C. § 2901.13) (Ord. 37-1975, passed 10-28-75)
§ 130.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
   CULPABILITY. Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as defined in
R.C. § 2901.22.
   INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from the
ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
   INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and  body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
   POSSESSION. A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or received
the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the thing
possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C.§2901.21) (Ord.37-1975, passed10-28-75)
§ 130.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for the element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for the element. When knowledge suffices to establish an
element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for the
element.
(R.C.§2901.22) (Ord.37-1975, passed 10-28-75)
§ 130.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23) (Ord. 37-1975, passed 10-28-75)
§ 130.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization as defined in §
130.09 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24) (Ord. 37-1975, passed 10-28-75)
§ 130.11 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor's effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor's criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder or an offense for which
the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first degree,
to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a drug abuse
offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number of unit
doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is an
offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if that
drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number of
unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range of
controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
(R.C.§ 2923.02) (Ord.37-1975, passed 10-28-75)
Penalty, see § 130.99
§ 130.12 COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of §
130.05.
   (D)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section solely
upon the testimony of an accomplice, unsupported by other evidence.
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(R.C. § 2923.03) (Ord. 37-1975, passed 10-28-75)
Penalty, see § 130.99
§ 130.13 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (A)   A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this municipality,
any element of which takes place in this municipality;
      (2)   While in this municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this municipality and the
other jurisdiction, or, while in this municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under
both the laws of this municipality and the other jurisdiction, and a
substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this
municipality by the person or another person involved in the conspiracy,
subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality;
      (4)   While out of this municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction, or activity in this municipality;
      (5)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this municipality;
      (6)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another person and subsequently brings the other person into this
municipality;
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
municipality in violation of the law of this state or municipality.
   (B)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (A)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense
in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this municipality.
   (C)   (1)   This municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto, and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest
shore of the Ohio River extending to the opposite shore line, between the
extended boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each of
those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio River with
any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any
court of Kentucky or of West Virginia that borders on the Ohio River and that
has jurisdiction on the Ohio River under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.
   (D)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
municipality for purposes of this section.
   (E)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this municipality.
   (F)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (G)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this municipality.
   (H)   For purposes of division (A)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (I)   As used in this section, COMPUTER, COMPUTER SYSTEM, COMPUTER NETWORK,
INFORMATION SERVICE, TELE- COMMUNICATION, TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEVICE,
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE, DATA and WRITING have the same meanings as in R.C.

of any moneys acquired from any sale or auction to the citizens’ reward
program.
      (2)   (a)   The Police Department shall adopt and comply with a written

the property, which shall include, but not be limited to, both of the
following:
               a.   The manner in which it was disposed, the date of

effort to locate persons entitled to possession of the property, to notify them
of when and where it may be claimed, and to return the property to them at the
earliest possible time. In the absence of evidence identifying persons entitled
to possession, it is sufficient notice to advertise in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county and to briefly describe the nature of the property in
custody and inviting persons to view and establish their right to it.
      (4)   As used in this section:
         CITIZENS’ REWARD PROGRAM has the same meaning as in R.C. § 9.92.

         (c)   Obscene materials shall be destroyed.
         (d)   Beer, intoxicating liquor, or alcohol seized from a person who

has not been paid in relation to the beer, intoxicating liquor, or alcohol, any
moneys acquired from the sale shall first be used to pay the tax. All other
money collected under this division (B)(1)(d) shall be paid into the State
Treasury. Any beer, intoxicating liquor, or alcohol that the Division
determines to be unfit for sale shall be destroyed.
         (e)   Money received by an inmate of a correctional institution from
an unauthorized source or in an unauthorized manner shall be returned to the
sender, if known, or deposited in the inmates’ industrial and entertainment
fund of the institution if the sender is not known.
         (f)   1.   Any mobile instrumentality forfeited under R.C. Chapter
2981 may be given to the law enforcement agency that initially seized the
mobile instrumentality for use in performing its duties, if the agency wants
the mobile instrumentality. The agency shall take the mobile instrumentality
subject to any security interest or lien on the mobile instrumentality.
            2.   Vehicles and vehicle parts forfeited under R.C. §§ 4549.61 to
4549.63 may be given to a law enforcement agency for use in performing its
duties. Those parts may be incorporated into any other official vehicle. Parts

relation to a delinquent child proceeding in a juvenile court, 10% of any
moneys acquired from the sale of property disposed of under this section shall
be applied to one or more community addiction services providers, as defined in
R.C. § 5119.01. A juvenile court shall not specify a services provider, except
as provided in this division, unless the services provider is in the same
county as the court or in a contiguous county. If no services provider is
located in any of those counties, the juvenile court may specify a services
provider anywhere in Ohio. The remaining 90% of the proceeds or cash shall be
applied as provided in division (B)(3) of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If the Board of County Commissioners recognizes a citizens’
reward program under R.C. § 9.92, the Board shall notify the Police Department
of the recognition by filing a copy of its resolution conferring that
recognition with the Police Department. When the Board recognizes a citizens’
reward program and the county includes a part, but not all, of the territory of
the municipality, the Board shall so notify the Police Department of the
recognition of the citizens' reward program only if the county contains the
highest percentage of the municipality’s population.
         (b)   Upon being so notified, the Police Department shall pay 25% of
any forfeited proceeds or cash derived from each sale of property disposed of
pursuant to this section to the citizens’ reward program for use exclusively to
pay rewards. No part of the funds may be used to pay expenses associated with
the program. If a citizens’ reward program that operates in more than one
county or in another state in addition to this state receives funds under this
section, the funds shall be used to pay rewards only for tips and information
to law enforcement agencies concerning offenses committed in the county from
which the funds were received.
      (6)   Any property forfeited under R.C. Chapter 2981 not be used to pay
any fine imposed upon a person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an
underlying criminal offense or a different offense arising out of the same
facts and circumstances.
      (7)   Any moneys acquired from the sale of personal effects, tools, or
other property seized because the personal effects, tools, or other property
were used in the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2905.32, 2907.21, or
2907.22 or derived from the proceeds of the commission of a violation of R.C. §
2905.32, 2907.21, or 2907.22 and disposed of pursuant to this division (B)

(R.C. § 2981.12)

otherwise provided in R.C. § 2981.13, property ordered forfeited as contraband,
proceeds, or an instrumentality pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2981 shall be disposed
of, used, or sold pursuant to division (B) of this section or R.C. § 2981.12.
If the property is to be sold under division (B) of this section or R.C. §
2981.12, the prosecutor shall cause notice of the proposed sale to be given in
accordance with law.
(R.C. § 2981.13(A))
Statutory reference:
   Forfeiture of property generally, see R.C. Chapter 2981
§ 130.15 SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (C)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
§ 130.99 PENALTY FOR TITLE XIII.
   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically classified within the body of the
section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section shall be deemed
a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than $500, or
imprisonment of not more than 6 months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) to (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
133.99 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court's
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender's jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §§
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(5)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(5)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(5)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §§
133.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
       (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
       (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
          (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
       (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences
the offender to any community control sanction or combination of community
control sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section,
and the offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or
private person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity
that comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the
sentencing court or to the department of probation or probation officer with
general control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private
person or entity reports the violation to the department of probation or
probation officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the
sentencing court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (D)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
             1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if
the total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the
violator does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of
this section;
             2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
             3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a
jail term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
       (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         (c)   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor
of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or
fourth degree;
         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         (f)   A term of basic probation supervision;
         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially similar municipal ordinance
or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially similar municipal ordinance
involving a person who was a family or household member at the time of the
violation, if the offender committed the offense in the vicinity of one or more
children who are not victims of the offense, and if the offender or the victim
of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or person in loco parentis of
one or more of those children. This division does not limit the court in
requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any offense or in any
circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)    If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
       (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
       (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (G) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (G), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (G) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or the victim's estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim's representative, victim's attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor's designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim's costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim's representative, victim's attorney, if applicable, or victim's estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim's estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim's attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim's estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s general fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the
treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s general fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   (a)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (G)(4)(b)
and (G)(4)(c) of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         (b)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         (c)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         (b)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;
         (e)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $1,000;
         (f)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to § 130.09,
either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this section.

§ 131.19 VALUE OF STOLEN PROPERTY.
   (A)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of R.C. § 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially similar municipal

determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (B)   (1)   When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716,14(A), R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or
2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. § 2913.31 or 2913.43 involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a
series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts
to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations
of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service
member or spouse of an active duty service member, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. The value of
the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §
2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more than one
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant
to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a
single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the
property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value as
required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)    When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)    In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2) or
(B)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (B)
(1) or (B)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (B)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C) (1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
the property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C) (1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is
the fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section,
FAIRMARKETVALUE is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

   (A)   These rules and regulations are adopted pursuant to R.C. § 711.09. The
provisions of R.C. Ch. 711 shall apply to all plats, subdivisions, and
conveyances of land in the city or within 3 miles of the corporate limits.
   (B)   There is adopted a plan for the major streets or thorough-fares and
for the parks and other open public grounds of the city and for all territory
within 3 miles of the corporate limits, such plan consisting of all existing
state highways and other major streets or thoroughfares and parks and other
open public grounds in the city and territory.
('59 Code, § 1111.02)
§ 151.03 COMMISSION ENDORSEMENT OF PLAT.
   No plat of a subdivision of land within the city or territory shall be

Penalty, see § 151.99
§ 151.04 CONVEYING BY LOTS; STREET ACCESS AND FRONTAGE.
   (A)   Except as provided in R.C. § 711.131, no part of any tract of land in
the city or such territory shall be conveyed by metes and bounds, but only by
lot number according to a plat duly prepared, executed, and approved by the
planning commission and by such other persons or officers as the law requires,
and recorded according to law.
   (B)   If a lot or parcel of land along an existing public street or road
shall be divided without platting in accordance with R.C. § 711.131, then not
more than one of the lots resulting from such division may be laid out at the
rear of another of the lots so as to have no frontage or less than 60 feet
frontage on such public street, but any such lot shall not be conveyed without
access by right-of-way or otherwise to the public street for ingress and egress
and utilities.
   (C)   The city engineer, or in the absence of such engineer, such other
person as may be appointed by the planning commission, is designated as the

of traffic within the subdivision as well as convenient access to adjoining
streets, thoroughfares, or unsubdivided land. Reserve strips at the edge of
subdivisions controlling access to the streets thereof from land adjoining the
subdivision shall be prohibited. In any case where a street will eventually be
extended beyond the plat but is temporarily dead-ended, an interim turn-around
will be required. Dead-end streets will be permitted in the cases where the
planning commission finds that such streets will be for the best interest of
the city, considering the topography of the areas and all other relevant
factors, if a circular roadway is provided at the end thereof so that vehicles
may be easily turned around without backing.
('59 Code, § 1111.05)
Penalty, see § 151.99
§ 151.06 STREET WIDTHS.
   All new streets on the plat of any subdivision shall have a minimum right-
of-way width of 50 feet, with not less than 30 feet of roadway, not including
slopes or ditches. If, in the opinion of the planning commission, the
prospective traffic load of any such street justifies a greater width, the
commission may, in its discretion, require such greater width for the street.
(Ord. 29-1963, passed 11-26-63)
Penalty, see § 151.99
§ 151.07 FRONTAGE; SIZE OF LOTS.

frontage of 60 feet, and a minimum area of 7,500 square feet, except that
smaller frontages may be approved for individual lots fronting on curved
streets where the width of any such lot increases going from front to rear, and
where the width of such lot at the probable location of the dwelling house to
be built thereon is not less than 60 feet; provided, however, the planning
commission may, in its discretion, approve the plat of a subdivision in an old,
established neighborhood of the city not involving any new streets, containing
lots of less width than 60 feet if such lots conform generally to the other
lots in such neighborhood; provided further, however, if it appears that any
subdivision will not be served within a reasonable time by a public sanitary
sewer system, then all lots shall have a minimum frontage of 100 feet and a
minimum area of 18,000 square feet, unless the subdivision will be served by a
public water system in which case the minimum frontage shall be 80 feet and the
minimum area 14,400 square feet.
   (B)   These requirements with reference to the size of lots not to be served
by a public sanitary sewer system may be varied upward or downward in
individual cases by the planning commission when in the opinion of the

CODE.
   The following procedures shall apply to the abatement of a violation of the

International Property Maintenance Code, may, at his or her discretion, proceed
with any available remedy detailed in Section 106 of the International Property
Maintenance Code:
   (A)   It shall be the responsibility of each owner of property within the
city to maintain their property in compliance with the International Property
Maintenance Code as adopted by the city. If the owner fails to comply with a
notice of violation properly served in accordance with Section 106.2 of the
International Property Maintenance Code, the Chief Code Official or designee is
authorized to cause said violation to be abated. Such abatement may be issued
by the Chief Code Official or designee without reporting said violation to
Council in the manner provided herein.
   (B)   The owner of property determined to be in violation of the
International Property Maintenance Code shall be served a written notice upon
the first identified violation per calendar year. Such notice shall state that
the owner has seven calendar days abate any violations of the International
Property Maintenance Code. Further, the notice shall conspicuously state that
failure to comply will result in the city causing the work to be done and the
costs to be assessed against the property in the manner provided by this
section. The notice shall also conspicuously state that any subsequent
violations of this section concerning the same property during the same
calendar year shall require no further notice.
   (C)   When it is deemed necessary for the city to abate the violation, in
accordance with the provisions of this section, the owner shall be charged at
the rate of $200 per hour or portion thereof, or the actual cost to the city of
the work, whichever is larger. The minimum charge shall be $200. Within 30
calendar days after such work is performed, the city shall serve an order to
the owner to pay the cost, which shall include a statement of the amount of
costs incurred and an explanation of the appeals process set forth in Section
111 of the International Property Maintenance Code. The order shall
additionally state that failure to pay within 30 calendar days or timely appeal
will result in the charge being certified to the County Fiscal Officer for
collection as other taxes and assessments are collected.
   (D)   If within 30 calendar days after the mailing of the order, the cost is
neither paid nor timely appealed, it may be certified to the County Fiscal
Officer for collection as other taxes and assessments are collected or the city
may seek recovery of such costs by civil action against the property owner
involved. An affidavit of facts shall be filed if more than $1,000 has been
expended by the city in abating the violation.

are more restrictive or which impose higher standards or requirements shall
prevail.

individual or entity responsible, and/or the owner of the property where the
site is found, shall be liable to the city for its costs incurred in conducting

   (G)   Rules of construction.

any such violation shall continue to be punishable to the full extent of the
law under the provisions of those ordinances, codes or regulations in effect at
the time the violation was committed.
   (K)   Findings and purpose. The City of Logan finds, determines and declares
that:
      (1)   Foreclosed properties and buildings, and properties in the
foreclosure process, that remain vacant and unoccupied for any appreciable
period of time become an attractive nuisance to children, a harborage for
rodents, an increased fire hazard, and an invitation to derelicts, vagrants and
criminals as a temporary residence and as a place to engage in illegal conduct,
frequently including illegal drug-related activity; that unkempt and unsecured
grounds surrounding such buildings invite the dumping of garbage and trash
thereon and the congregation of unauthorized persons who use the property for
illegal activity; that such buildings contribute to the growth of blight within
the city, necessitate additional governmental services and costs, significantly
interfere with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties, and depress
market values of surrounding properties, thereby reducing tax revenues; and
that such buildings accordingly create an unhealthy and unsafe condition
affecting the public and constitute an unreasonable use of property and a
public nuisance.
      (2)   Protection of the public health, safety and welfare requires the
establishment and enforcement of the means by which such nuisance conditions
may be prevented and abated.
      (3)   Vacant properties that are going through or have been through the
foreclosure process are frequently the responsibility of banks, lenders, and/or
servicers.
      (4)   Properties in default and real-estate owned ("REO") properties are
at a greater risk of becoming unmaintained vacant properties than other
properties.
      (5)   Even one vacant property that is not actively and well maintained,
monitored and managed can cause blight and crime.
      (6)   It is in the interest of the welfare of neighborhoods in the city
that banks, lenders, and/or servicers which fail to maintain vacant properties
that they own or have an interest in be subject to the imposition of fines.

§ 153.10 FORECLOSED PROPERTIES AND BUILDINGS.
   (A)   Findings and purpose. The City of Logan finds, determines and declares
that:
       (1)   Foreclosed properties and buildings, and properties in the
foreclosure process, that remain vacant and unoccupied for any appreciable
period of time become an attractive nuisance to children, a harborage for
rodents, an increased fire hazard, and an invitation to derelicts, vagrants and
criminals as a temporary residence and as a place to engage in illegal,
conduct, frequently including illegal drug-related activity; that unkempt and
unsecured grounds surrounding such buildings invite the dumping of garbage and
trash thereon and the congregation of unauthorized persons who use the property
for illegal activity; that such buildings contribute to the growth of blight
within the city, necessitate additional governmental services and costs,
significantly interfere with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties,
and depress market values of surrounding properties, thereby reducing tax
revenues; and that such buildings accordingly create an unhealthy and unsafe
condition affecting the public and constitute an unreasonable use of property
and a public nuisance;
      (2)   Protection of the public health, safety and welfare requires the
establishment and enforcement of the means by which such nuisance conditions
may be prevented and abated;
      (3)   Properties that are going through or have been through the
foreclosure process are frequently the responsibility of banks, lenders, and/or
servicers;
      (4)   Properties in default and real estate owned (REO) properties are at
a greater risk of becoming unmaintained vacant properties than other
properties;
      (5)   Even one vacant property that is not actively and well maintained,
monitored and managed can cause blight and crime;
      (6)   It is in the interest of the welfare of neighborhoods in the city
that banks, lenders, and/or servicers which fail to maintain vacant properties
that they own or have an interest in be subject to the imposition of fines.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
      ABANDONED. A structure that is unoccupied as the result of the
relinquishment of possession or control by an owner, or other person with the
right of possession or control of the structure, a mortgagor or the mortgagor's
assigns whether or not the mortgagor or mortgagor's assigns have relinquished
equity and title. A structure may be deemed ABANDONED when there is evidence of
conditions, taken separately or as a whole, that would lead a reasonable person
to conclude that the property was abandoned, including, but not limited to,
evidence of overgrown or dead vegetation, accumulation of newspapers,
circulars, flyers, mail, past due utility notices, or other means of notice by

pools or spas; an accumulation of newspapers, circulars, flyers and/or mail;
past due utility notices and/or disconnected utilities; an accumulation of
trash, junk and/or debris; the absence of window coverings such as curtains,

consent of the owner for a period of more than 30 days; or which presents
evidence of vacancy for a period of more than 30 days and which is not occupied
by the owner or an individual with the consent of owner for the purposes of
occupation.
   (C)   Registry. The City of Logan shall maintain a registry of the
properties described in this section in order to permit the city to determine

§ 153.11 RENTAL DWELLING PERMIT.
   (A)   Rental permit required. All residential property within the City of
Logan owned for rental purposes or occupied by a party other than the owner
(hereinafter, a "rental dwelling"), shall require a rental dwelling permit from
the office of code enforcement. Traditional motels and hotels are excluded from
the definition of rental dwelling. Nontraditional (long-term) rentals in hotels
and motels are not excluded from the definition of rental dwelling.
   (B)   Application.
      (1)   To obtain a rental dwelling permit, the owner or agent of a rental
dwelling, as defined in this Chapter, shall apply to the Chief Code Official of
the City of Logan or his/her designee. A rental dwelling permit shall be issued
by the Chief Code Official once a completed application is submitted to the
Chief Code Official. Incomplete or inaccurate application submission will
result in a denial notification.
      (2)   Any permit granted or issued under the terms of this section may be
revoked at any time by the Chief Code Official upon satisfactory proof of
unabated violation of any provision pursuant to this code or which could have
been grounds for failure to issue the original permit. Any person who feels
aggrieved by such revocation or denial may pursue the remedies as outlined in
Section 111 of the International Property Maintenance Code, said permit shall
be surrendered to the Code Enforcement office within five days of notification
of such revocation.
   (C)   Zoning. If a property is not properly zoned, the application for a
rental dwelling permit shall be denied.
   (D)   Maximum occupancy. The rental dwelling permit shall state the maximum
number of persons who may occupy the rental dwelling as determined by this
Chapter and other ordinances of the City of Logan.
   (E)   Authorized agent. If the applicant does not reside in Hocking County
or a contiguous county, no rental dwelling permit shall be issued or received
unless the applicant designates, in addition to himself, an agent for the
receipt of process pursuant to this section. Said agent must be designated in
writing on the application for said permit. Such agent must reside within
Hocking County.
   (F)   Notice of change of ownership. Any person selling or otherwise
relinquishing ownership or control of a rental dwelling for which a rental
dwelling permit has been issued shall notify the Chief Code Official of said
change in ownership within 30 days of the effective date of the transfer. Such
notice shall be in writing and shall include:
      (1)   The name and address of the new owner;
      (2)   The name and address of the previous owner; and
      (3)   If applicable, the agent for the new owner as required under the
provisions of §
153.11(E) herein.
   (G)   Expirations and renewals. Every rental dwelling permit shall be
renewed annually on January 2. A late fee, established by ordinance, will be
assessed for each rental dwelling permit fee unpaid on February 1.
   (H)   Fees.
      (1)   The annual fee for a rental dwelling permit shall be established by
ordinance. Nothing herein contained shall prohibit the owner of a dwelling used
for rental purposes from treating all the required inspection fees as a normal
business expense incidental to the renting of property and, therefore, an
appropriate consideration in the determination of debt. A permit issued after
July 1 shall pay half of the annual fee for that year.
      (2)   Failure to pay a rental dwelling permit renewal fee by March 1
shall result in the cancellation of the rental dwelling permit.
      (3)   A cancelled rental dwelling permit shall be reinstated upon payment
of all past due amounts, plus interest at the rate of 5% per annum, along with
a reinstatement fee of $100 per unit.
   (I)   Display of occupancy permit and compliance form. It is the
responsibility of the owner or agent of any transient rental dwelling (a
dwelling rented for less than 30 consecutive days) or multiple unit rental
dwellings to post the City of Logan Occupancy Permit and Compliance Form on the
back of the main entrance door or on the wall next to the door. This posted
form is part of the rental inspection requirements. Failure to post said form
is a minor misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $150. All other rental
dwellings are required to have the form on the premises and readily available
for inspection.
   (J)   Suspension and reinstatement. At the end of the time allowed for
correction of violations cited, the Chief Code Official, lacking sufficient
documentary evidence of compliance, shall re-inspect the rental dwelling. If
he/she determines that such conditions have not been corrected, he/she may
issue an order suspending the operating permit. Any person whose permit to
operate a rental dwelling has been suspended shall be entitled to a
reconsideration of the order by the appeals process described in Section 111 of
the International Property Maintenance Code. If no request for reconsideration
or appeals reaches the housing appeals board within 14 days following receipt
of an order of suspension, the permit shall be revoked, except that prior to
revocation any person whose permit has been suspended may request re-
inspection, upon a showing that the violation or violations cited in the notice
have been corrected. When the owner or agent has been ordered by the Chief Code
Official to correct violations that may exist in a dwelling, the inspector
shall re-inspect the property to verify compliance with the original order. If
additional inspections are required, due to noncompliance, a fee to be
established by ordinance shall be assessed to the owner for each additional
inspection.
   (K)   Violations. Failure to obtain a rental dwelling permit within 90 days
of January 1 and/or within 90 days of change of ownership and/or within 90 days
of change of use shall result in a $1,000 per unit fine. In addition, any
violation of this section shall be prosecuted pursuant to Section 106 and 107
of the International Property Maintenance Code.

      (2)   At all times of inspection, the owner, occupant, or agent shall be

and seek an administrative search warrant to allow an inspection. Any such

consistent with the terms of the warrant. If the court declines to issue a
warrant, or if no warrant is sought, the rental inspection shall still take

dwelling permits and all notices of change of ownership of any rental dwellings

      (9)   If the code enforcement office, upon inspection, finds the
complaint to be malicious or made in bad faith, they may assess the complainant
an inspection fee to be determined by ordinance, and the name of the
complainant may not be considered privileged.
      (10)   Any owner, occupant or person having care of property where an
inspection has been scheduled shall be assessed a fee established by separate
ordinance if this inspection is missed or not cancelled at least 24 hours prior
to the scheduled inspection.
   (D)   Nonperiodic inspection. Upon presentation of proper credentials and
following 24 hours' notice, the chief code official or his or her authorized
agent may enter, during daylight hours and with the consent of the occupant,
any rental dwelling in the City of Logan to enforce the housing code.
      (1)   A rental dwelling may be inspected if the chief code official has

§ 155.07 PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file within
360 days of the alleged violation with the Fair Housing Board a complaint in
writing, sworn to or affirmed, which shall state the name and address of the
person alleged to have committed the violation complained of and the
particulars thereof, and such other information as may be required by the
Board. The Board may also corroborate or initiate complaints on the basis of
testing carried out by its staff or volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (B)   Upon the filing of a complaint, the executive secretary of the Board
shall make such investigation as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and
issues. If the executive secretary determines that there are reasonable grounds
to believe a violation has occurred, he shall attempt to conciliate the matter
by methods of initial conference and persuasion with all interested parties and
such representatives as the parties may choose to assist them. Conciliation
conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done during such initial
conferences shall be made public by the Board or any member of the Board or its
staff unless the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (C)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an
admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent agreements shall
be signed on behalf of the Board by its chairman.
   (D)   The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Board or Ohio Civil Rights Commission in any investigation under
this chapter.
   (E)   If the executive secretary determines that the complaint lacks
reasonable grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so
inform the Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or
order such further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board
shall not dismiss such complaint without first affording the complainant an
opportunity to appear before the Board.
   (F)   If the executive secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a
violation of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties
have in good faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal
conciliation agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a
complaint is not susceptible to conciliation, he shall notify the Board
immediately and the Board shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to
determine whether a violation of this chapter has been committed. The Board
shall serve upon the respondent a statement of charges and a summons and shall
serve upon all interested parties a notice of the time and place of hearing.
The respondent or his authorized counsel may file such statements with the
Board prior to the hearing date as it deems necessary in support of its
position. The hearing shall be open to the public, except that the respondent
may request in writing a private hearing; the determination of such request
shall be discretionary with the Board. The hearing shall be held not less than
15 days after service of the statement of charges and summons. The summons so
issued shall be signed by two members of the Board and the issuance of such
summons shall require the attendance of named persons and the production of
relevant documents and records. The failure to comply with a summons shall
constitute a violation of this chapter. The interested parties may, at their
option, appear before the Board in person or by duly authorized representative
and may have the assistance of an attorney. The parties may present testimony
and evidence, and the right to cross examine witnesses shall be preserved. All
testimony and evidence shall be given under oath or by affirmation. The
executive secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing, which record shall
be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon request by any
principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such party a copy of
the hearing record, if any, at such cost as the Board deems appropriate.
   (G)   If at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has
violated this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Law
Director in executive session, state its findings to and cause the Law Director
to prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person
complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take
such affirmative action as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, with
notice if the Board determines that the person complained against has not after
15 calendar days following service of the Board's order complied with the
order, the Board shall recertify the matter to the Law Director for
enforcement.
   (H)   Upon recertification to the Law Director for enforcement, he shall
seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Fair
Housing Board before a court of competent jurisdiction. In any such proceeding,
where the court determines that there has been a violation of this chapter, the
court shall award compensatory damages and, where appropriate, punitive
damages, along with attorney fees. The court may also order such other relief
as it deems necessary or appropriate.
   (I)   If at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board determines upon the
preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained against
has not violated this chapter, the Board shall state and publish its findings
and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 156.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Council of
the City of Logan, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 34-2010, passed 9-28-10)
§ 156.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Logan, Ohio has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 34-2010, passed 9-28-10)
§ 156.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 34-2010, passed 9-28-10)
§ 156.004 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 34-2010, passed 9-28-10)
§ 156.005 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City of Logan, Ohio as identified in §
156.006, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the

   (A)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or
maps are adopted:

these regulations.
(Ord. 34-2010, passed 9-28-10)
§ 156.009 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.

damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 34-2010, passed 9-28-10)
§ 156.010 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the

incicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones Al-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to tht 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on flood boundary and floodway maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the
base flood elevation plus one foot of freeboard. In areas where no base flood
elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation
can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or
approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   FLOODWAY. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for
the nany unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of Logan, Ohio’s historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following; categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMT). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does net include a “recreational vehicle”. For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 3733.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code 3701-
27-01, a MANUFACTURED HOME PARK means any tract of land upon which three or
more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge
or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the “start of construction” commenced
on or after the initial effective date of the City of Logan, Ohio Flood
Insurance Rate Map dated January 17, 1986, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   PERSON.  Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in R.C. § 111.15 as any
governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or any
court.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.  A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis,
      (2)   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT. A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture under the provisions of R.C. §§ 4703.01 to 4703.19.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person registered as a professional
engineer under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a professional
surveyor under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Also known as “Areas of Special Flood Hazard”, it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in
any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance
Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as
Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer
to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal state or local
sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied is
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred “substantial
damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction”;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

§ 156.034 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (A)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (B)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps and / or flood insurance
study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
   (D)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in §§
156.070 through
156.075, Appeals and Variances.
   (E)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.

Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (B)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

§ 156.058 ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (A)   Development in Floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         (a)   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
156.034(A);
         (b)   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         (c)   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         (d)   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         (e)   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Logan, Ohio and the
Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
   (B)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         (a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         (b)   Section
156.058(A)(2)(a) and (c)-(e).
   (C)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Logan, Ohio specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in §
156.034(A)(1)(c) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

§ 156.073 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (A)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; descriptior of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee in the amount of $1,000.00.
   (B)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold a
public hearing within 30 days after the receipt of an application for a
variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least ten days before the date of the hearing.
   (C)   Public Hearing.
      (1)   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         (e)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         (f)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         (k)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         (d)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         (e)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (D)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in §
156.073(C)(1)(a) to (k) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.

§ 157.021 ZONING PERMITS REQUIRED.
   (A)   No building, structure, premises, land, or part thereof shall be
erected, moved, added to, structurally altered, established, changed,
converted, or enlarged either in whole or in part until a zoning permit is
issued by the Zoning Inspector. Zoning permits shall be issued only if the
applicant complies with all provisions of this chapter unless the Zoning
Inspector receives a written order from the Board of Zoning Appeals of City
Council concerning any matter where either body has either original or
appellate jurisdiction, or from a court of competent jurisdiction. Zoning
permits for portions of approved planned unit developments shall conform with
the final plan as approved by Council. In addition to the general standards

   Appeals and variances shall conform to the procedures and requirements of §§
157.041 to
157.047 of this chapter, as specified in §
157.014 (1) and (2). The Board has appellate jurisdiction relative to appeals
and variances. These procedures also apply to actions of the Board under the
provisions of §
157.014 (4),(5), and (6) of this chapter.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.041 APPEALS.
   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals concerning interpretation or
administration of this chapter, or the allegation that the Zoning Inspector
made an error in any order, requirement, or refusal to grant a permit, may be
taken by any applicant resident or owner of property within 1,000 feet, the
Mayor, any member of Council, or the Chairman of the Planning Commission, when
authorized by the full Commission. Such appeal shall be taken within ten days
after the publication of issuance of a zoning permit as required by §
157.023 by any party that has standing to appeal other than the applicant, and
within 20 days of action by the Zoning Inspector in the case of the applicant.
An appeal shall be taken by filing, with the Zoning Inspector a notice of
appeal specifying the grounds upon which the appeal is being taken along with
the fee established by Council. The applicant shall include with the notice of
appeal a list containing the name and mailing address of all owners of property
within 200 feet of the property in question. The Zoning Inspector shall
transmit to the Board of Zoning Appeals the notice of appeal and all the papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. He shall
also submit a written statement explaining his position on the issue to the
Board of Zoning Appeals. In the case where an appeal is filed relating to a
permit that has been approved by the Zoning Inspector, the applicant shall be
so notified and informed that, except as provided in this section, the zoning
permit will not become effective until a final decision is rendered by the
Board. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the Zoning Inspector from whom the appeal is taken certifies to
the Board of Zoning Appeals after the notice of appeal is filed with him, that
the reason of facts stated in the application, a stay would, in his opinion,
cause imminent peril to life and property. In such a case, proceedings shall
not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals or by a court of record on application, on notice to
the Zoning Inspector from whom the appeal is taken on due cause shown.

§ 157.042 VARIANCES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such
variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship. No non-
conforming use of neighboring lanes, structures, or buildings in the same
district and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures, or
buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for issuance of a
variance. Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience or
profit, but only where strict application of the provisions of this chapter
would result in unnecessary hardship by depriving a reasonable use of land to
the applicant.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.043 APPLICATION AND STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals unless and until a written application for a variance
is submitted to the Zoning Inspector who shall transmit the application to the
Board of Zoning Appeals, containing:
      (1)   Name, address, and phone number of applicants;
      (2)   Legal description of property and/or address;
      (3)   Description of the nature of the variance requested;
      (4)   A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested variance
conforms, beyond a reasonable doubt, to the following standards:
         (a)   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district. The
applicant shall demonstrate situations where exceptional narrowness,
shallowness, unusual shape, exceptional topographic conditions, or other
extraordinary conditions or situations related to the specific piece of
property in question involve practical difficulties in complying with the
requirements of this chapter that causes an undue hardship;
         (b)   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this chapter;
         (c)   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant;
         (d)   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district and that the variance will not be
of substantial detriment to adjacent property; and
         (e)   That the condition or situation related to the specific piece of
property is not of so general or recurrent a nature that the formulation of a
general regulation for the condition or situation would be practicable.
      (5)   A fee as established by Council; and
      (6)   A list containing the name and mailing address of all owners of
property within 200 feet of the property in question.
(Ord. 21-1996, passed 4-9-1996)
   (B)   A variance shall not be granted unless the Board makes specific
findings of fact based directly on the particular evidence presented to it,
which support conclusions that the standards and conditions imposed by this
section have been met by the applicant.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.044 PUBLIC HEARING AND NOTICE BY BOARD.
   A board shall fix a reasonable time for a public hearing on an appeal or
variance. Before holding the public hearing, written notice of such hearing
shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation at least 30
days before the date of said hearing. The notice shall set forth the time and
place of the public hearing, and the nature of the proposed appeal or variance.
The notice shall also state that after a final decision by the Board, the
decision can be appealed to the Hocking County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in R.C. Chapter 2506. In addition, notices shall also be sent, by
first class mail, to all owners of property within 200 feet of the property in
question and to such others as the Board determines should receive such notice.
Notices to individual property owners shall contain the same information as
required of notices published in the newspaper, and shall inform the person
that they have the right to appear in person or by attorney. Upon the day for
hearing any appeal or variance, the Board may adjourn the hearing in order to
obtain additional information or to cause such further notice as it deems
proper to be served upon such other property owners as it decides may be
interested in the appeal or variance. In the case of an adjourned hearing,
persons previously notified and persons already heard need not be notified of
the time of resumption of such hearing unless the Board so decides.

§ 157.045 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   In granting any appeal or variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this
chapter, the public interest, and for the protection of adjoining property
owners, and may require such evidence, guarantees, and bonds as it deems
appropriate. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the appeal or variance is granted, shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter and punishable under §
157.031 of this chapter.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.046 ACTION BY BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   Within 30 days after the final public hearing, the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall either approve, approve with supplementary conditions, or disapprove the
request for appeal or variance. The Board may, in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter and law, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination of the Zoning
Inspector. Upon making a final decision the Board shall notify the applicant
and the Zoning Inspector. The Zoning Inspector shall issue a permit, if the
appeal or variance is approved, in conformance with the action of the Board,
including the attachment of supplementary conditions and safeguards. The permit
becomes effective on the sixth day after the issuance of a permit unless a
notice of intent to appeal is filed with the Clerk of Council within five days
from the issuance of the permit. The Zoning Inspector, in issuing a zoning
permit in conformance with this section is not required to publish the notice
required by §
157.023 in a newspaper of general circulation.

§ 157.047 APPEALS OF DECISIONS OF BOARD.

§ 157.048 PROCEDURE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   Conditional use permits shall conform to the procedures and requirements of
§§
157.051 to
157.053 of this chapter. As specified in §
157.014(3), the Board has original jurisdiction relative to conditional uses.
It is recognized that an increasing number of new kinds of uses are appearing
daily, and that many of these and some other more conventional uses possess
characteristics of such unique and special nature relative to location, design,
size, method of operation, circulation, and public facilities that each
specific use must be considered individually. In order for a use to be
conditionally permitted, the specific use must be specified as a conditionally
permitted use in the relevant zoning district under this chapter.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.049 CONTENTS OF APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   An application for conditional use permit shall be filed with the Zoning
Inspector who shall transmit it to the Board of Zoning Appeals, by at least one
owner of property for which the conditional use is proposed. At a minimum, the
application shall contain the following information:
   (A)   Name, address, and phone number of applicant;
   (B)   Legal description of property and/or address;
   (C)   Description of existing use;
   (D)   Zoning district;
   (E)   Description of proposed conditional use;
   (F)   A plan of the proposed site for the conditional use showing the
location of all buildings, parking and loading areas, traffic access and
traffic circulation, open spaces, landscaping, refuse and service areas,
utilities, signs, yards, and such other information as the Board may require;
   (G)   A statement explaining how the specific conditions for the specific
use as required in §
157.130 will be met;
   (H)   A fee as established by Council; and
   (I)   A list containing the name and mailing address of all owners of
property within 200 feet of the property in question.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.050 GENERAL STANDARDS FOR ALL CONDITIONAL USES.
   In addition to the specific requirements for conditionally permitted uses as
specified in §
157.130, the Board shall review the particular facts and circumstances of each
proposed use in terms of the following standards and shall, beyond a reasonable
doubt, find adequate evidence showing that such use at the proposed location:
   (A)   Is in fact, a conditional use as established under the provisions of
this chapter or has been found to be substantially similar to a conditional use
permitted by this chapter;
   (B)   Will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such use will not change the
essential character of the area;
   (C)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring
uses;
   (D)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services
such as streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures, refuse
disposal, water and sewer, and schools; or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services;
   (E)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property, or
the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke,
fumes, glare, or odors;
   (F)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so
designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding areas;
and
   (G)   Will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural,
scenic, or historic feature of major importance.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.051 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   In granting any conditional use, the Board may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter. Violations of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
conditional use is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and
punishable as provided in §
157.031.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.052 PROCEDURE FOR HEARING, NOTICE, DECISIONS AND APPEAL.
   Upon receipt of the application for a conditional use permit, the Board
shall hold a public hearing, publish notice in a newspaper, and give written
notice to all parties in interest according to the procedures specified in §§
157.044 through
157.047. The intent of this section is to provide procedures for conditional
use permits that are identical to the procedures for appeals and variances. To
the extent necessary, the terminology in §§
157.044 to
157.047 shall be modified to reflect that the application and procedure is for
the issuance of a conditional use permit.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93; Am. Ord. 34-2014, passed 9-23-14)
§ 157.053 SPECIFIC CONDITIONAL USE CRITERIA.
   In addition to the general standards applicable to all conditional uses, the
specific conditional use criteria as specified in §
157.130 shall apply to those uses that are conditionally permitted under the
provisions of this chapter. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Board of
Zoning Appeals from prescribing supplementary conditions and safeguards in
addition to these requirements in conformance with §
157.051 of this chapter.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.054 PROCEDURE AND REQUIREMENTS TO DETERMINE THAT A USE IS SUBSTANTIALLY
SIMILAR.
   (A)   Where a specific use is proposed that is not listed or provided for in
this chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals may make a determination, upon
appeal, that the proposed use is substantially similar to a specific use that
is listed or provided for in this chapter. If the Board finds that a use is
substantially similar to a specific use listed in this chapter, the
substantially similar use is deemed to be a substantially similar permitted use
in those districts where the specific use is a permitted use and a
substantially similar conditional use in those districts where the specific use
is a conditionally permitted use.
   (B)   In making a determination that a proposed use is a substantially
similar use, the Board shall follow the procedures relating to appeals and
variances as specified in §§
157.044 to
157.046 of this chapter. Upon making a determination that a proposed use is
substantially similar, the Board shall notify Council in writing of its
decision and shall include findings of fact showing its rationale for action.
Unless Council, within 30 days, rejects the determination of the Board by
resolution, the substantially similar use determination by the Board shall
become effective. A determination by the Board that a proposed use is not
substantially similar may not be appealed by an applicant to Council, it being
the intent of this section that the applicant instead request an amendment to
the chapter.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.055 STANDARDS FOR CONSIDERATION OF SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR USES.
   (A)   The following standards and guidelines shall be considered by the
board when making a determination that a use is substantially similar:
      (1)   The relationship and compatibility of the use to the general use
classification system as specified in §
157.119 of this chapter;
      (2)   The nature, predominate character, and intensity of the use in
relation to those uses specified in this chapter; and
      (3)   The size, dimensional requirements, traffic generation potential,
anticipated sign needs, parking requirements, and other regulatory
characteristics normally associated with uses specified in this chapter.
   (B)   A statement relating to each of these issues shall be included in the
finding of fact submitted to Council.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.056 EFFECT OF DETERMINATION THAT A USE IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR.
   Should a use be determined to be substantially similar to a specific use
provided for in this chapter it shall then be permitted in the same manner and
under the same conditions and procedures as the specific use it has been found
to be substantially similar to is permitted. The purpose of this section is to
provide relief to persons whose proposed uses are not specifically listed in
this chapter, but are so similar to uses that are permitted that they should be
regulated in the same manner as uses that are permitted and listed in this
chapter without the necessity of requesting an amendment.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.057 RECORD OF SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR USES.
   The Zoning Inspector shall maintain a record of all uses that have been
determined to be substantially similar and all uses that have been determined
not to be substantially similar. Such records shall be maintained by the Zoning
Inspector in a separate book entitled "Record of Substantially Similar Uses"
which shall be a public record. The list shall be used by the Zoning Inspector
in the issuance of future permits. The record shall include the use as listed
in this chapter, the use not listed in the chapter upon which a substantially
similar determination was made, and the dates of action by the Board of Zoning
Appeals and Council as the case may be.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.058 PROCEDURE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR AMENDMENTS.

and structures in combination existing on the effective state of this chapter,
or any amendment thereto, may be continued even though it does not conform to
the provisions of this chapter. Nothing contained in this chapter shall require
any change in the layout, plans, construction, size or use of any lot,
structure, use of land, use of structures, or use of land and structures in
combination for which a zoning permit became effective prior to the effective
date of this chapter or any amendment thereto. No non-conformity may be moved,
extended, altered, or expanded except as otherwise specifically provided for in
this chapter without the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals.

§ 157.081 CERTIFICATES FOR NON- CONFORMING USES.
   The Zoning Inspector may upon his own initiative or shall when requested by
any owner, issue a certificate for any lot, structure, use of land, use of
structure, or use of land and structure in combination, that certifies that the
lot, structure or use is a valid non-conforming use. The certificate shall
specify why the use is a non-conforming use including a description of the
extent and kind of use made of the property in question, the portion of the
structure or land used for the non-conforming use, and the extent that
dimensional requirements are non-conforming. The purpose of this section is to
protect the owners of lands or structures that are or become non-conforming. No
fee shall be charged for such a certificate. One copy of the certificate shall
be returned to the owner and one copy shall be retained by the Zoning Inspector
in a separate book entitled "Certificates of Non-Conforming Uses" which shall
be a public record.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.082 SUBSTITUTION OF NON-CONFORMING USES.
   If no structural alterations are made, except as required by the building
code or property maintenance code, any non-conforming use may, upon appeal to
the Board of Zoning Appeals, be changed to another non-conforming use of the
same or of a more restricted classification, or the Board shall find that the
use proposed for substitution is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the
district than the existing non-conforming use. In permitting such change, the
Board may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with other
provisions of this chapter, which if violated are punishable under §
157.031. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted use
or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less
restricted use.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.083 EXPANSION OF NON-CONFORMING BUILDINGS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit a building containing a non-

upon the land in ownership at the effective date of this chapter or the date of
any amendments making a use nonconforming, provided that an extension is
necessary and incidental to the existing properties, involves no structure or
buildings, and meets all dimensional requirements. Non-conforming mobile home
parks may not be expanded by increasing the existing number of licensed pads by
more than 20%.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)

(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.086 EXPANSION OF RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES IN NON-RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.

being in a district that prohibits residences may be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed, or structurally altered provided it meets with the requirements
of an appropriate residential district determined by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.087 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCES.
   On any non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-
conforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or
replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided that
the cubic content existing when it became non-conforming shall not be
increased. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening
or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
such official. Where appropriate, a building permit for such activities shall
be required.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)

current fair market value at the time of damage may not be reconstructed and
used as before the damage occurred. In such instances new construction shall
conform with all dimensional requirements and only uses permitted or
conditionally permitted under this chapter shall be allowed. If the damage is
60 percent or less of its current fair market value, it may be reconstructed to
conform with previous dimensional characteristics and the previous use may be
permitted if such reconstruction begins within 90 days from the date of damage.
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall review data submitted by an owner to
determine if the damage is actually less than 60 percent of current fair market
value and shall utilize the most recent Hocking County tax duplicate in making
said determination. The 90 day provision may be extended by the Board of Zoning
Appeals only where evidence is submitted that the applicant is awaiting an
insurance settlement. In the case of a damaged structure, the owner shall have
debris removed within 30 days.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.089 DISCONTINUANCE OF NON-CONFORMING USES.

is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to the regulations
for the district and the non-conforming use may not thereafter be resumed.

§ 157.090 TRAILERS PARKED ON LOTS.
   (A)   When a non-conforming trailer or mobile home located on any lot other
than in a mobile home park is removed, it shall not be relocated on such lot
unless the unit is of equal or better value. In this instance, the replacement
shall be on site within two weeks of the removal of the previous unit. In
addition, in order to be a permitted use under this section, all other relevant
requirements of the district shall be met.
   (B)   In addition, all replacement mobile homes that are permitted under
this section shall within 30 days after placement install skirting around the
replacement unit. The design of the skirting shall be subject to approval by
the Zoning Inspector, and shall be of such nature that it will be an asset to
the neighborhood and the design shall conform with the general architectural
character of the neighborhood. Bales of straw and rough finish insulation board
shall not be used as skirting. Any skirting that is not purchased through
regular mobile home supply sources and fabricated by or for the resident shall
be subject to specific approval in compliance with the standards of this
section by the Zoning Inspector.
   (C)   A permit is required whenever a trailer or mobile home is removed from
or added to a lot. Notification of said removal or addition is to be given to
the Director of Public Service and Safety. Information regarding the value of
the old trailer being removed from the lot along with information regarding the
value of the new trailer is to be provided to the Director of Public Service
and Safety along with all other pertinent data. The director of Public Service
and Safety may charge the same fee for this permit as is charged for issuing a

§ 157.091 SINGLE NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-
family dwelling may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective
date of adoption of this chapter or amendment, notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of this chapter. The lot must be in separate
ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership
or where at least one owner is an owner of the adjacent lot. This provision
shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or
width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that
the width of the lot is not less than 40 feet. Yard dimensions and dimensional
requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot
shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
Variance of yard requirements from the required standards shall be obtained
only through action of the Board of Zoning Appeals who may relax the standards
for variances to assure that the public interest is balanced with the right of
the owner to reasonably use the lot of record. In granting such a variance, the
Board shall attempt to comply with the following standards:
   (A)   Each of the side yard widths on any lot shall not be less than 10% of
the width of the lot; provided, however, that on a corner lot the width of the
side yard adjoining the side street lot line shall not be less than eight feet
or 20% of the frontage, whichever is greater.
   (B)   The depth of the rear yard of any lot need not exceed 20% of the depth
of the lot, but in no case shall it be less than 20 feet.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.092 NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD IN COMBINATION.
   If two or more lots, or a combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership, are on record at the time of amendment
of this chapter and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not meet
the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall
be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this chapter. All
lots shall be required to be replatted or resurveyed, as required, to meet the
current area and frontage requirements for the required use before a zoning
permit may be issued. No portion of the parcel shall be used or sold in a
manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements
established by the chapter, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which
created a lot with a width or area below the requirements stated in this
chapter.

feet. Lot area does not include any portion of a public or private street
right-of-way, but may include portions of utility easements.
   (B)   Lot width shall mean the minimum width of a lot as measured at the
road right-of-way line. In the case of a lot on a cul-de-sac, the lot width
shall be measured at the front building setback line.

buildings, including attached garages, breezeways, and storage buildings must
be set back from the front, side, or rear lot lines to constitute a front,
side, or rear yard.

buildings, including detached garages and other buildings must be set back from
front, side, or rear lot lines.
   (E)   Percent of lot coverage shall mean the maximum percent of lot area
that may be covered by all principal and accessory buildings.
   (F)   Building height shall mean the maximum height in feet for any

as specified in §
157.127 of this chapter. Building height shall be measured in compliance with
the definition of "building height" and varies with the type of roof of the
building.
   (G)   Floor area shall mean the minimum required floor area of principal
buildings per dwelling unit, and shall be determined in accordance with the

§ 157.123 YARD AND LOT REQUIREMENTS FOR MULTI-FAMILY AND TWO-FAMILY DWELLINGS.
   Multi-family dwellings shall be considered as one building for the purpose
of determining front, side, and rear yard requirements. The entire group as a
unit shall require one front, one rear, and two side yards as specified for

right-of-way lines, provided however, that this requirement shall not require
the buildable width of a lot of record to be reduced to less than 40 feet for
the purposes of a principal building. Accessory buildings shall comply with the

project beyond the average front yard so established. However, a front yard
depth shall not be required to exceed 50% in excess of the front yard otherwise
required in the district in which the lot is located.

during the preceding five years. Applicants shall consider this provision when
making original application for a zoning permit so that future anticipated
roofed additions can comply with the setback requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Open or lattice enclosed fire escapes, outside stairways, balconies,
and similar structures may be permitted into a required rear or side yard a
maximum of three feet when so placed as to not obstruct light or ventilation.

building exceeds the maximum height otherwise permitted in the district, its
side and rear yards shall be increased by one foot over the side and rear yards
otherwise required in the district. Church spires, belfries, cupolas and domes,
monuments, fire and hose towers, observation towers, transmission towers,
chimneys, smokestacks, flag poles, television and radio towers, tanks, water

      (1)   The axis of the parabola shall be determined;
      (2)   A line shall be drawn that intersects with the foremost point of
intersection of the parabola and the axis at a right angle;
      (3)   From this point of intersection, the following distances shall be
measured backward along the axis into the lot or parcel in question:
         (a)   Where the above regulation would otherwise require a 20 foot
measurement, the distance along the axis is established at 14 feet and two
inches; and
         (b)   Where the above regulation would require an eight foot
measurement, the distance along the axis is established at five feet and eight
inches.
      (4)   When this distance along the axis has been established, a line
parallel to the line established in subsection (2) above and at a right angle
to the point established in either (3)(a) or (3)(b) above shall be drawn and
extend to the point of intersection with the streets to establish the area
within which obstructions are prohibited.

§ 157.148 TEMPORARY USES.
   (A)   The following regulations are necessary to govern the operation of
certain uses which are non-permanent in nature. Application for a zoning permit
shall be made to the Zoning Inspector at least seven days before the event,
containing a graphic description of the property to be utilized and a site
plan, a description of the proposed sanitary facilities, and parking space for
the proposed temporary use. The following uses are deemed to be temporary uses
and shall be subject to the specific regulations and time limits which follow
and to the regulations of any district in which such use is located:
      (1)   Real estate sales offices may be permitted within any district for
any new subdivision. Such office shall contain no living accommodations. The
permit shall be valid for one year, but two six-month extensions may be granted
if conditions warrant such renewal. Such office shall be removed upon
completion of sales of the lots therein, or upon expiration of the zoning
permit, whichever occurs sooner.
      (2)   Temporary offices for contractors and equipment sheds incidental to
a construction project may be permitted within any district. The permit shall
not be valid for more than one year but may be renewed for six-month extensions
if construction is substantially underway. Such uses shall be removed
immediately upon completion of the construction project, or upon expiration of
the zoning permit, whichever occurs sooner.
      (3)   Temporary sales may be permitted within parking lots within any
business district. A temporary zoning permit for such activities shall only be
issued three times to any individual or organization for any such parking lot
within any twelve month period and shall not exceed a period of four
consecutive days. Written permission from the property owners is required. A
temporary use permit shall not be issued if it is determined by the Zoning
Inspector that encroachment of more than 25% of the required storage of parking
areas will take place. Not more than one sale shall be permitted at the same
time. The zoning permit shall be prominently displayed at the site.
      (4)   Temporary retail sales and services such as plants, flowers,
statutes, art, farm produce and similar items on lots other than parking lots,
including lots where an existing business is operating and business lots where
the business is vacated by for profit individuals or organizations shall be
permitted in any business district upon the issuance of a temporary zoning
permit. The applicant shall submit:
         (a)   A copy of his current vendors license or transient vendors
license.
         (b)   A written statement by the owner of the lot giving him
permission to utilize the lot on the proposed dates.
   (B)   The applicant may not domicile or camp overnight on the lot in
question. Not more than one permit shall be issued at the same time for any
lot, and permits for such activities shall only be issued three times for any
particular lot within any twelve month period and shall not exceed two
consecutive days unless approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals. The zoning
permit shall be prominently displayed at the site.
   (C)   This section shall not be interpreted to prohibit any such temporary
retail sales and services where a valid covenant or deed restriction
specifically authorizes the sale of specified articles on the land in question.
In the event the covenant should be vacated by proper legal action, the
provisions of this section shall then apply.
   (D)   Garage sales may be permitted within any district in which dwellings
are permitted. A garage sale permit for such activities shall only be issued
three times for any particular lot within any 12 month period and shall not
exceed a period of four consecutive days. Accessory parking shall be provided
upon the lot in such a manner as to not create a traffic hazard. Garage sales
organized or sponsored by a community organization shall require a garage sale
permit to be issued to the community organization. Any persons participating in
such a community sponsored garage sale is not required to obtain an individual
permit. Any person participating in a community sponsored garage sale is still
entitled to three permits within any 12 month period. For the purposes of this
section, garage sales shall also include barn sales, yard sales, and similar
uses or activities.

provided for any permitted or conditionally permitted nonresidential use that
abuts an S-1 or any R district in addition to the required setbacks and yard
requirements as specified in the Official and Supplementary Schedules of
Permitted Uses and Dimensional Requirements. Applicants for a zoning permit or
conditional use permit may request a variance from yard or setback requirements
in conjunction with a plan for screening and the Board of Zoning Appeals may
consider the variance by weighing the relationship of the proposed screening
plan and the requested dimensional variance in relation to the impact on
neighboring properties. A request for such a variance for a permitted use shall
follow the standard variance procedures of this chapter. A requested variance
for a conditionally permitted use shall be incorporated into the conditional
use procedure specified in this chapter, it being the intent of this section
that a separate variance procedure for a conditionally permitted use is not
necessary. The following provisions shall apply to screening:
   (A)   Screening shall be provided for one or more of the following purposes:
      (1)   A visual barrier to partially or completely obstruct the view of
structures or activities.

      (2)   A solidly constructed decorative fence;
      (3)   Louvered fence;
      (4)   Dense vegetable plantings; and/or
      (5)   Landscaped mounding.
   (C)   Height of screening shall be in accordance with the following:
      (1)   Visual screening walls, fences, plantings, or mounds shall be a
minimum of five 1/2 feet high in order to accomplish the desired screening
effect, except in required front yards when maximum height shall be not greater
than two 1/2 feet. Plantings shall be a minimum of four feet in height at the
time of planting.
      (2)   A dense vegetative planting with a minimum height of four feet at
planting and a mature height of at least five 1/2 feet or greater or a solidly
constructed decorative fence shall be permanently maintained along the mutual
boundary of an accessory parking area and adjacent land zoned for residential
uses except for the portion of such boundary located within a required front
yard.
   (D)   Screening for purposes of absorbing or deflecting noise shall have a
depth of at least 15 feet of dense planting or a solid masonry wall in
combination with decorative plantings. The height shall be adequate to absorb
noise as determined by the Zoning Inspector in relation to the nature of the
use.
   (E)   Whenever required screening is adjacent to parking areas or driveways,
such screening shall be protected by bumper blocks, posts, or curbing to avoid
damage by vehicles.
   (F)   All screening shall be trimmed, maintained in good condition, and free
of advertising or other signs, provided this shall not prohibit directional
signs and other signs for the efficient flow of vehicles.

§ 157.242 REGULATION OF ADULT ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES.
   The following regulations shall apply, in addition to all other regulations
in this chapter, to adult entertainment businesses as defined herein.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.243 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The purpose of §§
157.242 to
157.246 of this chapter is to promote and protect public health, safety, morals
and general welfare of the citizens of the city by regulating adult
entertainment businesses and sexually oriented businesses. The establishment of
such businesses has a deleterious effect on existing businesses and the
surrounding residential segments of neighborhoods causing increased crime and
blight and downgrading of property values. Such businesses, characteristically,
utilize excessive illumination to identify their locations at night, thereby
disturbing passing motorists, and operate during the late hours of the night
and early hours of the morning, thereby creating excessive noise levels
adversely affecting the surrounding neighborhoods. The type and character of
the merchandise and paraphernalia sold or available for viewing at such
businesses create an aura of mystery and enticement for youth that is increased
by lascivious and suggestive advertising that is often employed to promulgate
the availability of these products and services. Furthermore, such businesses
have a general overall adverse effect on the health, safety, and welfare of the
patrons of such businesses, visitors, and citizens of the city and upon the
surrounding neighborhoods, thereby necessitating the regulation of the location
of such businesses and uses within the city. It is also recognized that
sexually oriented businesses, due to their nature, have serious objectionable
operational characteristics particularly when they are located in close
proximity to each other, thereby contributing to urban blight and downgrading
the quality of life in the adjacent areas.
   (B)   It is the intent of these sections to regulate entertainment
businesses, as defined herein, in such a manner as to prevent the erosion of
the character of the surrounding neighborhoods and to prohibit the
establishment of such businesses within close proximity to existing adult
entertainment businesses, residentially zoned areas, schools, churches, parks
and playgrounds within the city.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)

regulations applicable to other properties in the zoning district in which they
are located.
   (B)   The City Zoning Commission shall issue an occupancy and compliance

§ 157.247 PROHIBITION OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA ESTABLISHMENTS AND PROHIBITION
AGAINST THE POSSESSION, MANUFACTURE, DELIVERY, OR ADVERTISEMENT OF DRUG
PARAPHERNALIA BY ANY PERSON.
   The following provisions shall apply, in addition to all other regulations
in this chapter and the Codified Ordinances of the City of Logan, to the
location of drug paraphernalia establishments and to the possession,
manufacture, delivery or advertisement of drug paraphernalia by any person.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.248 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The purpose of §§
157.247 to
157.254 of this chapter is to promote and protect the public health, safety,
and welfare by prohibiting the location of any drug paraphernalia establishment
within the city and to make it unlawful for any person to possess, manufacture,
deliver or advertise drug paraphernalia. There is substantial awareness and
concern over the general proliferation of "head shops" engaged in the sale of
paraphernalia associated with drugs. Such establishments tend to entice young
people to abuse substances which are known to be harmful and unsafe for human
consumption. Furthermore, the drug paraphernalia industry has an adverse effect
of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city, thereby
necessitating these prohibitions.
   (B)   It is further the intent of these sections to establish penalties
under §
157.031 of this chapter for the illegal location of any drug paraphernalia
establishment in addition to the criminal penalties provided herein and to
establish other penalties for the possession, manufacture delivery, or

§ 157.286 REGULATION OF SATELLITE DISH ANTENNAS.
   The following regulations shall apply to the location and construction of
dish-type satellite signal-receiving antennas as herein defined.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.287 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose of §§
157.286 to
157.292 of this chapter to regulate the location of dish-type satellite signal-
receiving antennas within the city to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare of the residents of the city. It is the general policy of the city that
such structures shall be considered as accessory structures and shall comply
with the regulations for accessory buildings and structures in the appropriate
zoning district as specified in the Official and Supplementary Schedules of
Permitted Uses and Dimensional Requirements. It is further recognized that the
location of such structures require a direct line of sight in order to
effectively receive programming, and this allows for variances from location
requirements in the same manner as other variances from yard or other
dimensional requirements for accessory structures.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.288 DEFINITIONS.
   DISH-TYPE SATELLITE SIGNAL-RECEIVING ANTENNAS, also referred to as EARTH
STATIONS or GROUND STATIONS. One, or a combination of the following:
   (1)   A signal-receiving device (dish antenna or dish-type antenna), the
purpose of which is to receive communication or other signals from satellites
in earth orbit and other extraterrestrial sources.
   (2)   A low-noise amplifier (LNA) which is situated at the focal point of
the receiving component and the purpose of which is to magnify, store, transfer
and/or transmit electronic or light signals.
   (3)   A coaxial cable the purpose of which is to carry or transmit said
signals to a receiver.
   RECEIVER. A television set or radio receiver.
   DISH. That part of a satellite signal-receiving antenna characteristically
shaped like a saucer or dish.
   GROUNDING ROD. A metal pole permanently positioned in the earth to serve as
an electrical conductor through which electrical current may safely pass and
dissipate.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.289 LOCATION OF SATELLITE DISH ANTENNAS.
   Satellite dish antennas are permitted uses in conformance with the
procedures and requirements of §§
157.286 to
157.292 of this chapter. Satellite dish antennas are considered as accessory
structures and shall comply with the setback requirements for accessory
buildings as required in the Official and Supplementary Schedules of Permitted
Uses and Dimensional Requirements for the district where the location of a
satellite dish antenna is proposed.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.290 ZONING PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person, firm or corporation shall erect a satellite dish antenna in the
city without a permit, and no installation or erection shall commence before
such permit is issued in accordance with this chapter. Any owner who desires to
construct or erect a satellite dish antenna may apply for a zoning permit as
specified in §
157.021 of this chapter. In addition to the requirements of §
157.022 of this chapter, the application for a permit shall include a plat plan
of the lot, premises, or parcel of land, showing exact location of the proposed
earth station and all other buildings on the subject lot; a description of the
kind of earth station proposed; plans showing specifications and elevations of
the proposed location; and sufficient details to show the method of assembly
and construction together with a permit fee. The permit fee shall cover the
costs of reviewing the construction plans and specifications, inspecting the
final construction and processing the application. After construction of a
satellite dish antenna, a Certificate of Occupancy shall be required as
specified in §
157.025 of this chapter.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.291 OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR SATELLITE DISH ANTENNAS.
   The following requirements shall apply to satellite dish antennas:
   (A)   The maximum diameter of any ground mounted dish antenna shall not
exceed twelve feet.
   (B)   The maximum height of any ground mounted satellite dish antenna shall
not exceed fifteen feet above the finished grade.
   (C)   Only metal support, galvanized construction shall be utilized.
   (D)   Ground mounted satellite dish antennas shall be embedded in a concrete
base or caissons that extend below the normal frost level.
   (E)   The structure, including foundation, shall be designed to withstand
wind force of up to 85 miles per hour in conformance with generally accepted
engineering practices.
   (F)   Any driving motor shall be limited to 110 volt maximum power design,

the height of the antenna and structure shall not exceed the maximum height of
the district. It shall be securely mounted to the roof of a permitted principal
or accessory building that meets all setback requirements and shall not be
mounted upon appurtenances such as chimneys, towers, trees, poles, or spires.
   (K)   Appropriate screening, as determined by the Zoning Inspector, shall be
provided. In the event the applicant proves, by clear and convincing technical
evidence, that screening will interfere with the need for the satellite dish
antenna to have a direct line of sight or unobstructed view to the satellite.
This requirement may be waived or modified to assure the antenna can properly
function.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.292 VARIANCES ON LOCATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS.
   An applicant may request a variance from the accessory building requirements
and the required height restrictions in compliance with the procedures of §§
157.042 to
157.047 of this chapter. In addition to all requirements of these sections, the
applicant shall submit clear and convincing evidence that the requested
variance is necessary in order for the satellite dish antenna to have a direct
line of sight or unobstructed view to the satellite. In the case where this
provision applies the variance granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be
the minimum variance required to achieve the necessary direct line of sight to
assure that the antenna can properly function.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.293 REGULATION OF COMMUNITY BASED RESIDENTIAL SOCIAL SERVICE FACILITIES.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of
§§ 157.294 to
157.298 of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and welfare by
establishing standards relating to the development, location, and operation of
community based residential social service facilities. These facilities may
include a wide variety of living arrangements from private family living to
family and group homes, foster care homes, halfway houses, and semi-
institutional residential programs as herein defined and described. The city
recognizes the concept of deinstitutionalization and realizes that social
research apparently shows that such living arrangements improve the lives of
various dependent populations and may facilitate their rehabilitation or
reintegration into society. It is further recognized that such facilities can
help a resident regain self-confidence and a feeling of self-worth and
belonging by assisting the resident in adjusting to living with a developmental
disability, an emotional or mental disorder, or other handicaps, including
community perceived antisocial behavior, in lieu of or subsequent to placement
within an institution. Such living arrangements also offer abused, neglected,
or dependent children with a stable living environment, assist residents in
recuperating from the effects of drugs or alcohol, help the elderly lead more
productive lives, and assist juvenile and adult offenders to reintegrate into
society upon release from a correctional program or diversion from such a
program.
   (B)   Intent. It is the policy of the city to permit residential social
service facilities within specified zoning districts under certain
circumstances in order to assure their access to appropriate neighborhood
environments but to regulate their location to prevent a clustering of such
facilities which may create a de facto social service district containing a
concentration of such facilities which can have a negative impact on
neighborhoods and the city.
(Ord. 6-1993, passed 3-8-93)
§ 157.294 DEFINITION OF COMMUNITY BASED RESIDENTIAL SOCIAL SERVICE FACILITIES.
