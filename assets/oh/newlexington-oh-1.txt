EDITOR'S NOTE
Â Â Â The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
Â Â Â This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
Â Â Â Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
Â Â Â The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

Article VIII
FINANCE, TAXATION AND DEBT
SECTION 8.01. Â Â Â General.
Â Â Â The laws of Ohio relating to budgets, appropriations, taxation, debts,

applicable to the Municipality, except as modified by or necessarily

is made in the Constitution of Ohio.
SECTION 8.02. Â Â Â Contracting Powers and Procedures.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â The Administrative Director shall be the contracting officer of the
Municipality and shall award and execute all contracts on behalf of the
Municipality. When there is a vacancy in the office of Administrative Director
or he or she is temporarily absent or disabled, the Mayor shall exercise the
powers granted to the Administrative Director by this Section.
Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â When any expenditure or contract is more than the amount specified by
the laws of Ohio for which work may be accomplished only after advertisement
and bidding, such contract or expenditure shall first be authorized or directed
by an ordinance or resolution passed by the Council and shall be advertised
once a week for at least two weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the
Municipality; provided the Council, by an ordinance or resolution adopted by a
vote of at least two-thirds of its members, may authorize, without advertising
and competitive bidding, contracts and expenditures for any purpose where the
statutory or common law of Ohio does not require competitive bidding.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â When it becomes necessary to make alterations or modifications in
connection with any work or improvements covered by contract, they shall be
made only upon the order of the Administrative Director. No such order shall be
effective until the price to be paid for the work or material, or both, under
the altered or modified contract, shall have been agreed upon in writing and
signed by the contractor and the Administrative Director on behalf of the
Municipality. Modifications or alterations in contracts shall not require
advertising and competitive bidding.

purpose, and it remains unencumbered.
Â Â Â Said certification as to the availability of funds and the appropriation of

avoid the requirements of competitive bidding.

SECTION 10.02. Â Â Â Recall.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The electors shall have the power to remove from office by a recall

term, an elector or electors of the Municipality may serve written notice upon
the Clerk of Council of their intent to circulate petitions for the recall of a
named elected official or officials. No petitions for the recall of an elected
official may be circulated until such written notice of intent is served upon
the Clerk of Council. Not later than thirty days after service of such notice
of intent on the Clerk of Council, such persons may file, with the Clerk of
Council, a petition demanding the removal of an elected official. Separate
petitions shall be filed for each elected official sought to be removed by
recall. The Clerk shall note thereon the name and address of the person filing
the petition and the date of such filing, and deliver to such person a receipt
therefor and attach a copy thereof to said petition. Such petition may be
circulated in separate parts, but the separate parts shall be bound together
and filed as one instrument. Each part shall contain the name and office of the
person whose removal is sought. Such petition shall be signed by at least that
number of electors which equals fifteen percent in number of the electors
voting at the last preceding regular municipal election.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â Within ten days after the day on which such petition is filed, the
Clerk of Council shall determine whether or not it meets the requirements
hereof. If the Clerk of Council shall find the petition insufficient, the Clerk
shall promptly certify the particulars in which the petition is insufficient,
deliver a copy of the certificate to the person who filed the petition and make
a record of such delivery. Such person shall be allowed a period of ten days
after the day on which such delivery was made in which to make the petition
sufficient. If the Clerk of Council shall find the petition sufficient, the
Clerk shall promptly so certify to Council and shall deliver a copy of such
certificate to the person whose removal is sought within five days and make a
record of such delivery.
Â Â Â (D) Â Â Â If the person whose removal is sought shall not resign within five
days after the day on which the Clerk's certificate shall have been delivered,
Council shall, by ordinance or resolution, fix a day for holding a recall
election, not less than thirty days nor more than forty-five days after the
date of the Clerk's certification of sufficiency to the Council, and shall
cause notice of such recall election to be published on the same day of each
week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City.
Â Â Â At such recall election, this question shall be placed upon the ballot:
"Shall (naming the person whose removal is sought) be allowed to continue as
(naming the office) . . ", with the provision on the ballot for voting
affirmatively or negatively. In the event a majority of the vote is negative,
such person shall be removed, the office shall be vacant, and such vacancy
shall be filled as provided in this Charter. If the person is not removed at
such recall election, no further recall petitions shall be filed against him or
her for a period of one year following such election.
Article XI
GENERAL PROVISIONS
SECTION 11.01. Â Â Â Removal of Officials.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â Elected officials and members of Boards and Commissions shall be
removed for cause as provided in this Section of the Charter.
Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â As used in this Section of the Charter, the "Charging Official" shall
mean: the "Mayor" except where the person accused of a grounds for removal is
the person holding the office of Mayor; or the "President of Council" where the
person sought to be removed for cause holds the office of Mayor.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â The Charging Official, if he or she has reason to believe there is
probable cause (as such causes are defined in this Section
11.01) for the removal of an elected official or member of a Board or
Commission, shall give notice of the alleged cause for removal and the time,
date and place of the commencement of hearing for removal, which shall not be
earlier than ten days after the service of the notice, to the accused person by
personal service, certified mail, or by leaving a copy of such notice at the
person's last known place of residence in the Municipality. At such time, date
and place and at any adjourned meetings, the Council shall hear, provide an
opportunity to the accused person to be heard and present defenses, and
determine whether the accused person shall be removed from his or her office.
The Council shall remove an official for any of the following causes by a two-
thirds vote of the members of the Council, provided that if the accused person
is a member of Council, such person shall not vote on any matter during the
removal procedure and shall not be counted in determining required majorities:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Â Â Â Unexcused absences from any four consecutive regular meetings of
the Council or the Board or Commission on which such person serves or any six
regular or special meetings thereof in any year, provided the accused person
received notice of special meetings. An absence from a regular or special
meeting may be excused by a majority vote of the members of the Council or the
Board or Commission on which such person serves at any time, including the
excusing of any absence after action is initiated but prior to the commencement
of hearings for the person's removal under this Section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â Failure to possess or maintain the qualifications of the office.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â A determination that the accused person is guilty of misfeasance,
malfeasance or nonfeasance in office.
Â Â Â (D) Â Â Â Upon removal of an official from office pursuant to this Section, the
office of the offending person shall be vacant, subject to any appeal to and
review by an appropriate court, and the vacancy shall be filled as provided in
this Charter.
Â Â Â (E) Â Â Â The removal of an official or the occurrence of any of the causes
permitting the removal shall not invalidate any action of the official or any
body, including the Council, in which the member participated. The subsequent
removal of a person who fills a vacancy created pursuant to this Section by the
reinstatement by a court of a person previously removed by the Council, shall
not invalidate any action of the person who filled the vacancy or any body,
including the Council, in which such person who filled the vacancy
participated.
Â Â Â (F) Â Â Â The Council shall be the judge of the qualifications of and of the
grounds for removal from office and shall conduct the proceedings relative to
removal. The Council shall have the power to subpoena witnesses, administer
oaths and require the production of evidence, either on its own motion or
through the process of any appropriate court or officer thereof. A person
charged with conduct constituting grounds for removal from office shall be
entitled to either a private or public hearing on demand, but in any case, a
record of the proceedings shall be made and preserved. If a public hearing is
demanded, a notice of such hearing shall be published in one or more newspapers
of general circulation in the Municipality at least one week in advance of the
hearing, and in such an event, the Mayor, or other presiding officer of the
Council, may reschedule the time, date and place of the hearing set by the
Charging Official to accommodate the publication of the notice. If the hearing
is rescheduled, the Mayor or other presiding officer, shall notify the accused
person of such fact. Decisions made by the Council under this Section shall be
subject to review by the Courts on matters of law and whether the Council acted
arbitrarily and without probative evidence to support the grounds for removal.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â The Director of Law shall prosecute the removal proceedings before the
Council and any review thereof by the Courts. If a person accused is not
finally removed, the Municipality shall pay the reasonable costs of the defense
of such person and any compensation withheld pending the appeal of the action
of the Council.
SECTION 11.02. Â Â Â Conflicts of Interest, Ethics, Campaign Financing.
Â Â Â The laws of Ohio pertaining to conflicts of interest, criminal misbehavior,
ethics and financial disclosure by municipal officials and employees, and
campaign financing and other election practices of candidates for municipal
office shall apply under this Charter.
SECTION 11.03. Â Â Â Succession.
Â Â Â The Municipality of New Lexington under this Charter is hereby declared to

Ohio; and shall have title to all property, real and personal, owned by its
predecessor, including all moneys on deposit and all taxes or assessments in
process of collection, together with all accounts receivable and rights of

and debts of its predecessor, and any other obligations for which it may be
held liable by any court of competent jurisdiction. All contracts entered into
by the Municipality or for its benefit prior to the effective date of this
Charter shall continue in full force and effect.

of the Municipality nor any right, liability, pending suit or prosecution,

franchise granted by the Municipality nor pending proceedings for the
authorization of public improvements or the levy of assessments therefor.
Except as a contrary intent appears in this Charter, all acts of Council of the
Municipality including ordinances or resolutions in effect at the date this
Charter becomes effective, shall continue in effect until amended or repealed.

officer thereof shall be abated or affected by the adoption of this Charter.
All actions or proceedings shall be prosecuted or defended under the laws in
effect at the time they were filed.
SECTION 11.05. Â Â Â Retirement System - Health District.

Municipality and the organization of health districts shall be applicable under

Ohio.
SECTION 11.07. Â Â Â Effect of Partial Invalidity.
Â Â Â A determination that all or any part of any Article, Section or Division of
this Charter is invalid shall not invalidate or impair the force and effect of
any other part, except to the extent that the other part is wholly dependent
for its operation upon the part declared invalid.

prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments

CHAPTER 103
Public Records
103.01Â Â Â Policy adopted.
Â 
Â 
103.01 POLICY ADOPTED.
City of New Lexington, Ohio
Policy For Processing Public Records Requests
Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 149.43.
Â Â Â This Policy is adopted, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 149.43. This Policy reflects
the Cityâ€™s commitment to process each public records request (â€œPRRâ€) in a
lawful, competent, uniform and reasonably timely manner. The City is committed
to an open and transparent government, and to serve the City constituency in an
appropriate and responsible manner.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Protocol: When a public records request is received by any City
employee, the matter should be immediately referred to the City Administrator
and legal counsel. Legal counsel must evaluate and determine whether the
records requested are public records and/or if they must be redacted before a
disclosure.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â City Policy:Â Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â PRRs are preferred in writing. The writing may be a letter or a
pre-printed City form, which form the City will make available for the public.
If the requester refuses to submit the PRR in writing, the person receiving the
PRR should document that fact and the PRR itself, on the City form.
The request should specifically and particularly describe the record being
sought. Although Ohio law does not require requests in writing, such written
requests are preferred to avoid misunderstandings as to the records requested.
The City form should be utilized when possible. The form includes a space for
the requesterâ€™s name and contact information. The City will send the responsive
information to the requester by regular U.S. mail within a reasonable time
after the request is received.
The City charge is fifteen (15) cents per copy page, for copies which exceed
$1.00. For larger copies, color copies or information which must be sent to an
outside company for copying, the City will (prior to incurring the cost for
copies) inform the person making the request of the estimated charges, and
request a confirmation that the person acknowledges the cost and agrees to pay.
If the requester refuses to submit information in writing, that fact shall be
noted by the person receiving the request. The City will require advance
payment of any such cost, prior to transmission of the documentation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Upon receipt of a PRR, the recipient shall note upon the written
PRR, the date upon which the request was received. If the requester refuses the
written PRR form, that form shall be used by the City employee to document the
request as clearly and succinctly as possible.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Immediately upon receipt, the recipient shall notify the City
Administrator of the PRR.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The City Administrator and legal counsel shall review the PRR to
determine the sufficiency of information contained in the request, as relates
to the ability of the City to determine the specific information sought. The
City Administrator shall then determine the proper City official to prepare the
responsive documents. The City Administrator shall assign the PRR to the
appropriate official for processing.
If questions regarding the requested information exist, the City Administrator
shall determine if communication with the person making the request is
necessary. If the request is overly broad or ambiguous, the City Administrator
shall so inform the recipient in writing, and state with specificity that the
request may be revised by the requester.
If the PRR specifies a requested date or time for delivery of records sought,
the City Administrator shall make every effort to communicate with the
requester, prior to requested date/time, to inform the requester of status.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The City Administrator shall oversee the document review and
preparation of documentation believed to be responsive to the PRR.
The City is under no legal duty to create a new record or analysis of existing
records in response to a public records request. If however, the City computers
are currently programmed to generate the requested output, the City should
provide the record as requested.
Note: No requester has the right to make their own copies of public records. To
maintain the integrity of City records, it is the official policy of the City
that the City will duplicate its own records.
When an inspection of records is requested, a City employee shall accompany the
requester during any inspection to make sure that no records are taken or
altered. All requests for inspection must occur within regular business hours
( 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.). The City will promptly arrange for an appointment for
inspection at a mutually convenient time.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The City Administrator will ensure the response is handled in a
reasonably timely manner. The City Administrator will submit all documentation
deemed responsive to the PRR, to legal counsel for a review in accordance with
Ohio law.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â The requester has a right to receive the record, duplicated on
paper, upon the medium on which the City keeps it (ie., computer disk) or upon
any other medium that the City determines it can reasonably be duplicated as
part of normal operations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â The City will inform the requester, in writing, of the costs of
copies, reproductions, and postage, and request payment before delivery of
records for all requests that exceed $1.00.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â The City will issue the responsive documentation along with a
reasonably detailed enclosure letter to the person making the PRR. The
transmission shall be by regular U.S. mail.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â The enclosure letter should state, with specificity, the fees for
the copies.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â The City will require payment of all charges prior to issuing the
PRR response.
Â Â Â Note: If you do not know the answer to a records request, do not deny
access. If the request is vague or overly broad, ask the requester to be more
specific or narrow the issue or applicable time period. If you are not sure if
the records are exempt from public disclosure, tell the requester that we will
provide inspection and/or copies to the extent such is permissible as soon as
we have had an opportunity to review the request and documents which may be
responsive to your request.

costs or expenses allowed by law. In addition, the Village of New Lexington may
pursue any other remedy or may institute an appropriate action or proceeding in
a court of competent jurisdiction to collect the charges imposed under this
ordinance together with costs and attorney fees.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Appeal Procedure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Any responsible party who receives an invoice for assessable costs
shall have an opportunity to meet with the New Lexington Fire Chief or designee
to request a modification of the assessable costs. The responsible party shall
request such meeting in writing within fourteen (14) days from the date of
service of the invoice.

calendar days after the date on which the responsible party files the request
to appear. After a responsible party has been given an opportunity to appear
before it, the New Lexington Village Council shall promptly determine whether

Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Failure to file a timely written request for a meeting with the New
Lexington Fire Chief or New Lexington Village Council request to appear before

shall further constitute the responsible partyâ€™s agreement to pay the
assessable costs invoiced.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â When the incident or event requiring Department services involves
real property, if the assessable costs, including any late payment fee or
interest, assessed against a responsible party are not paid when due, said
costs shall be a special assessment against the real property and shall, to the
extent permitted by law, constitute a lien upon such real property in the same
manner as property taxes and/or special assessments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The Village Finance Director shall, prior to September 30 of each
year, certify to the Assessor of the township or village in which the subject
real property is located the face that such assessable costs are delinquent and
unpaid. Such Township or Village Assessor is then authorized to enter the
delinquent amount on the next general ad valorem property tax roll as a charge
against the subject real property, and the lien thereon shall, to the extent
permitted by law, be enforce in the same manner as provided by law for
delinquent and unpaid real property taxes.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Multiple Property Protection. When a particular fire protection or
other emergency vehicle service rendered by the New Lexington Fire Department
directly benefits more than one person or property, the owner of each property
so benefited, and each person so benefited where property protection si not
involved, is liable for the payment of the full charge for such service.
Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â Severability. If any provision or part of this ordinance is declared
by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such
declaration shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision or par, which shall remain in full force and effect.

accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â (p)Â Â Â â€œTaxable yearâ€ means the calendar year, or the fiscal year upon the

(including charitable and other non-profit organizations), or association or
any other entity or person; an officer or employee (whether elected, appointed,
or commissioned) of the United States Government or any of its agencies or of
the State of Ohio or any of its political subdivisions or agencies thereof; or

Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â â€œQualifying wagesâ€ means wages, as defined in Section 3121(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code, without regard to any wage limitations, adjusted as
follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Deduct any amount included in wages if the amount constitutes
compensation attributable to a plan or program described in Section 125 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Add the following amounts:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Any amount not included in wages solely because the employee
was employed by the employer prior to April 1, 1986;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Any amount not included in wages because the amount arises
from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of a stock option, the exercise
of a stock option, or the sale, exchange, or other disposition of stock
purchased under a stock option. This sub-paragraph applies only to those
amounts constituting ordinary income.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Any amount not included in wages if the amount is an amount

the time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of
the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.

disposition, the income is then considered ordinary income (vs. capital gains)

Village of New Lexington, Ohio.

winnings, and games of chance by residents of the Village of New Lexington,
Ohio. No deductions shall be allowed against these sources of income. However,

allowed against gambling and sports winnings.

interlocking directorates, or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within this
Municipality constituting a portion only of its total business, the Tax Clerk
shall require such additional information as he may deem necessary to ascertain
whether net profits are properly allocated to this Municipality. If the Tax
Clerk finds net profits are not properly allocated to this Municipality by
reason of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by
stock ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such division,

year thereafter. When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period
different from the calendar year, the return shall be filed within four months
from the end of such fiscal year or period. The Tax Clerk is hereby authorized
to provide by regulation that the return of an employer or employers, showing
the amount of tax deducted by said employer or employers from the salaries,

furnished by or obtainable upon request from such Tax Clerk setting forth:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other

thereof, pay to the Tax Clerk the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been
deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.06, or where any portion of said tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.07, or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit

refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar
($1.00) shall be collected or refunded.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Amended returns. Where necessary an amended return must be filed
in order to report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a

Tax Clerk. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or apportionment
of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayerâ€™s tax liability to this Municipality, such
taxpayer shall make and file an amended return showing income subject to the
income tax of this Municipality based upon such final determination of federal
tax liability, and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for
refund of any overpayment.

returns, or the refusal to submit to such examination by any employer or person
subject or presumed to be subject to the tax by any officer, agent or employee
of a person subject to the tax required to withheld tax or the failure of any
person to comply with the provisions of this section or with any order of
subpoena of the Tax Clerk authorized hereby shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter, punishable as provided in Section
181.13.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Tax returns, investigations, hearings and all audit papers and

Â Â Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â The tax on income and the withholding tax established by this
Chapter
182 are authorized by Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution. The
tax on income and the withholding tax established by this Chapter
182 are deemed to be levied in accordance with, and to be consistent with, the

deemed to incorporate the provisions of ORC 718.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The tax is an annual tax levied on the income of every person residing
in or earning or receiving income in the municipal corporation, and shall be
measured by municipal taxable income. The Municipality shall tax income at a
uniform rate. The tax is levied on Municipal Taxable Income, as defined herein.
(Ord. 15-24. Passed 11-24-15.)
182.012 PURPOSES OF TAX; RATE.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â To provide funds for the purposes of general municipal operations,

Â Â Â Â Â Â (Ord. 15-24. Passed 11-24-15.)
182.014 STATEMENT OF PROCEDURAL HISTORY; STATE MANDATED CHANGES TO MUNICIPAL
INCOME TAX.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Significant and wide-ranging amendments to ORC 718 were enacted by Am
Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich
on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal corporations to conform to
and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have the authority to impose,
enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 2015-24,
effective January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends Chapter
181 in accordance with the provisions of ORC 718 to allow the Municipality to
continue the income tax and withholding tax administration and collection
efforts on behalf of the Municipality.
(Ord. 15-24. Passed 11-24-15.)
182.02 EFFECTIVE DATE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Ordinance 2015-24, effective January 1, 2016, and corresponding
changes to ORC 718, apply to municipal taxable years beginning on or after
January 1, 2016. All provisions of this Chapter
181 apply to taxable years beginning 2016 and succeeding taxable years.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Ordinance 2015-24 does not repeal the existing sections of Chapter
181 for any taxable year prior to 2016, but rather amends Chapter
181 effective January 1, 2016. For municipal taxable years beginning before

enforce the income tax of the Municipality under ORC 718 and ordinances and
resolutions of the Municipality as that chapter and those ordinances and
resolutions existed before January 1, 2016. (Ord. 15-24. Passed 11-24-15.)
182.03 DEFINITIONS.
Â Â Â Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
Â Â Â For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
Â Â Â As used in this chapter:
Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under division 23(D) of this section, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â (i) Â Â Â Except as provided in division (1)(D)(ii) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (ii) Â Â Â Division (1)(D)(i) of this section does not apply to the
extent the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250
of the Internal Revenue Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (E) Â Â Â Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (F) Â Â Â In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (G) Â Â Â Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Ohio Revised Code;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â (i) Â Â Â Except as limited by divisions (1)(H)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of
this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (ii)Â Â Â No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (1)(H) of
this section to offset qualifying wages.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (iii)Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021,
or 2022, a person may not deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a
municipal corporation that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, more
than fifty per cent of the amount of the deduction otherwise allowed by
division (1)(H)(i) of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a person
may deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a municipal corporation
that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, the full amount allowed by
division (1)(H)(i) of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (iv)Â Â Â Any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward deduction that is
available must be utilized before a taxpayer may deduct any amount pursuant to
division (1)(H) of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (v)Â Â Â Nothing in division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section precludes a
person from carrying forward, for use with respect to any return filed for a
taxable year beginning after 2018, any amount of net operating loss that was
not fully utilized by operation of division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section. To
the extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully utilized in
one or more taxable years by operation of division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this
section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable

tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
Â Â Â (F) Â Â Â Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
Â Â Â (G) Â Â Â Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
Â Â Â (H) Â Â Â On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
Â Â Â (I) Â Â Â The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
Â Â Â (J) Â Â Â An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
Â Â Â (K) Â Â Â A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (6) Â Â Â "Worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for more than
twenty days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not include the
home of an employee.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7) Â Â Â "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a calendar year, unless
one of the following conditions applies:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â The employee's principal place of work is located in the

more than twenty days" if either of the following applies at the time the
services commence:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (i) Â Â Â The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (ii) Â Â Â The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c) Â Â Â The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
182.051 of this Chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d) Â Â Â The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c) Â Â Â Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d) Â Â Â Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e) Â Â Â Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
Â Â Â (E) Â Â Â Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
182.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
Â Â Â (F) Â Â Â Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
182.051 of this Chapter.
Â Â Â (G) Â Â Â In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
Â Â Â Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
section 3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales
agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct
and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator
shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the

each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If
the name, address, or social security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4) Â Â Â A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5) Â Â Â If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6) Â Â Â The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
Â Â Â (D) Â Â Â If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
Â Â Â (E) Â Â Â Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4) Â Â Â Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5) Â Â Â Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6) Â Â Â A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
Â Â Â (F) Â Â Â If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
Â Â Â (G) Â Â Â The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
Â Â Â (H) Â Â Â If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or
annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or
filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at
the rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Â Â Â (I) Â Â Â Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
182.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
Â Â Â (J) Â Â Â The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and

182.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
Â Â Â "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
182.03(23).

182.03(11) of this Chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section
182.062 of this Chapter.Â Â Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â "Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carryforward" is defined in Section
182.03 (32) of this Chapter.

182.062 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.
Â Â Â This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
182.052 of this Chapter;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
Â Â Â (B) (1) Â Â Â If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â Separate accounting;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c) Â Â Â The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d) Â Â Â A modification of one or more of the factors.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4) Â Â Â Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â The employer;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c) Â Â Â A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,

compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
Â Â Â (D) Â Â Â For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c) Â Â Â The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4) Â Â Â To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5) Â Â Â Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to

accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
 182.081 of this Chapter.
Â Â Â (G) Â Â Â If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
182.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4) Â Â Â "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5) Â Â Â "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income

municipal income tax.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations

file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.

parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
 182.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
182.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4) Â Â Â If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
Â Â Â (F) Â Â Â Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
182.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
Â Â Â (G) Â Â Â Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
Â Â Â (H) Â Â Â Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

allowing such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit. (Ord. 15-24. Passed 11-
24-15.)

estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal corporation's
income tax for the current taxable year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to a municipal
corporation for the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the
taxpayer is entitled, and after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding
payment, or credit from another taxable year.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for

estimated taxes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the

taxable year, ninety per cent of the tax liability for the taxable year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of

in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d) Â Â Â For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
Â Â Â (E) Â Â Â An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
 182.091 of this Chapter for that year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view ofÂ administrative costs and other
factors.

182.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â As used in this section:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4) Â Â Â In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation

nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
Â Â Â (D) Â Â Â The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

ZONE.
Â Â Â A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
182.081 of this Chapter.

182.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
182.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
182.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. (Ord.
15-24. Passed 11-24-15.)

duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support

Â Â Â (E) Â Â Â No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.

method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5) Â Â Â After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date

profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
182.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
182.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
182.092 of this Chapter prevails.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.

be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that date by United States mail to the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official with which the report, claim, statement, or other document is required
to be filed, or to which the payment is required to be made, the date of the
postmark stamped on the cover in which the report, claim statement, or other
document, or payment is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or
the date of payment. â€œThe date of postmarkâ€ means, in the event there is more
than one date on the cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the
postal service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Ord. 16-17. Passed 11-21-16.)
Â Â Â (J) Â Â Â The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
 183.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
Â Â Â (K) Â Â Â Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
Â Â Â (L) Â Â Â The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
Â Â Â (M) Â Â Â When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
Â Â Â (N)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
182.052 of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Ord. 15-24. Passed 11-24-15.)
182.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.

the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
Â Â Â (D) Â Â Â For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. 15-24. Passed 11-24-15.)

be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
Â Â Â (D) Â Â Â The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
Â Â Â (E) Â Â Â Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 15-24. Passed 11-24-15.)
182.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
Â Â Â (D) Â Â Â An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
Â Â Â (E) Â Â Â If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state

taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or

thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
182.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax

the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
182.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 15-24. Passed 11-24-15.)
182.096 REFUNDS.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the

forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate

(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section 182.18 of this
Chapter.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.

request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the

any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in

Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a

provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement. (Ord. 15-24. Passed
11-24-15.)
182.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the

necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax

such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or

prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
 182.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
182.99 of this Chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with

or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the

a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.

Â Â Â (J) Â Â Â An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 15-24. Passed 11-24-15.)
182.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Ord. 15-24. Passed 11-24-15.)
182.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4) Â Â Â Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5) Â Â Â A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6) Â Â Â A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7) Â Â Â If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8) Â Â Â No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9) Â Â Â A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
Â Â Â (D) Â Â Â The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
Â Â Â (E) Â Â Â The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 15-24. Passed 11-24-15.)
182.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (i) Â Â Â Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (ii)Â Â Â One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
182.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.Â Â Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
182.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
182.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â The period during which an appeal related to the imposition
of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Ord. 15-24. Passed 11-24-15.)
182.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the legislative
authority of the Municipality has the authority, by Ordinance or Resolution, to
adopt rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.

182.24 FILING NET PROFIT TAXES; ELECTION TO BE SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS OF
CHAPTER.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â A taxpayer may elect to be subject to sections 718.80 to 718.95 of
the Revised Code in lieu of the provisions set forth in the remainder of this
chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon the
taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of each
municipal income tax for which the taxpayer is liable for the term of the

Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections

Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the tax commissioner and each municipal corporation
in which the taxpayer conducted business during the previous taxable year of
its termination of the election.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c) Â Â Â Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code,

electors of a municipal corporation approve an increase in the rate of the
municipal corporation's tax on income that takes effect within that year, the
municipal corporation shall certify to the tax commissioner the new rate of tax
not less than sixty days before the effective date of the increase, after which
effective date the commissioner shall apply the increased rate.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â A municipal corporation, within ninety days of receiving a
taxpayer's notification of election under division (B) of this section, shall
submit to the tax commissioner, on a form prescribed by the tax commissioner,
the following information regarding the taxpayer:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â The amount of any net operating loss that the taxpayer is
entitled to carry forward to a future tax year;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â The amount of any net operating loss carryforward utilized by
the taxpayer in prior years;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c) Â Â Â Any credits granted by the municipal corporation to which the
taxpayer is entitled, the amount of such credits, whether the credits may be
carried forward to future tax years, and, if the credits may be carried
forward, the duration of any such carryforward;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d) Â Â Â Any overpayments of tax that the taxpayer has elected to carry
forward to a subsequent tax year;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e) Â Â Â Any other information the municipal corporation deems relevant
in order to effectuate the tax commissioner's efficient administration of the
tax on the municipal corporation's behalf.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â If any municipal corporation fails to timely comply with divisions
(C)(l) and (2) of this section, the tax commissioner shall notify the director
of budget and management, who, upon receiving such notification, shall withhold
from each payment made to the municipal corporation under section 718.83 of the
Revised Code fifty per cent of the amount of the payment otherwise due to the
municipal corporation under that section. The director shall compute the
withholding on the basis of the tax rate most recently certified to the tax
commissioner until the municipal corporation complies with divisions (C)(l) and
(2) of this section.
Â Â Â (D) Â Â Â The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer sections 718.80 to
718.95 of the Revised Code. In addition to any other powers conferred upon the

Revised Code in the administrator's administration of a municipal income tax,
and those sections shall not be applied to any taxpayer that has not made the
election under this section.
Â Â Â (F) Â Â Â Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to make any section of
this chapter, other than sections 718.01 and 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised
Code, applicable to the tax commissioner's administration of a municipal income
tax or to any taxpayer that has made the election under this section.
Â Â Â (G) Â Â Â The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 18-3. Passed 2-20-18.)
182.25 DEFINITIONS.
Â Â Â If a term used in sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code that is not
otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable context in both the
laws of the United States relating to federal income tax and in Title LVII of
the Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then the use of the term in the
laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall have control
over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Revised Code, unless the term is
defined in Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code, in which case the definition in
that chapter shall control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal
Revenue Code includes other laws of the United States related to federal income
taxes. If a term is defined in both this section and section 718.01 of the
Revised Code, the definition in this section shall control for all uses of that
term in sections 718.80 through 718.95 of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â As used in sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code only:
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under section 718.82 of the Revised Code, as applicable,
reduced by any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward available to the person
for the municipal corporation.
Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code, means a
C corporation's federal taxable income before net operating losses and special
deductions as determined under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(l) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5) Â Â Â Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6) Â Â Â In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7) Â Â Â Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8) Â Â Â Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9) Â Â Â Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
section 718.86 of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of section
718.86 of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (L)(2) of section 718.01 of the Revised
Code, and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the election
described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code, the
taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if
the taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar
amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible
expense unless such payments are in consideration for the use of capital and
treated as payment of interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code
or United States treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified
self-employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer,
amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts
paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.
Â Â Â Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section 718.01 of the Revised
Code, except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons or entities
subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745. of the Revised Code. "Taxpayer"
may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons
are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
Â Â Â (D) Â Â Â "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code for the
purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and includes declarations of
estimated tax.
Â Â Â (E) Â Â Â "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the
Revised Code is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation of more
than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The tax commissioner may
prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year for a taxpayer that
has had a change of its taxable year for federal income tax purposes, for a
taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for federal income tax
purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new taxpayer that
would otherwise have no taxable year.
Â Â Â (F) Â Â Â "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section 718.90 of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (Ord. 18-3. Passed 2-20-18.)
182.26 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
Â Â Â This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in a municipal corporation and that has made the election under
section 718.80 of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of a municipal corporation shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the municipal corporation for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipal corporation during the taxable period to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated.
Â Â Â As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipal corporation to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the
business or profession, wherever the individual's services are performed,
excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under
section 718.011 of the Revised Code;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the municipal
corporation to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
a municipal corporation, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â Separate accounting;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c) Â Â Â The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d) Â Â Â A modification of one or more of the factors.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of section
718.90 of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(l) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of section 718.90 of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â The employer;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c) Â Â Â A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(l)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(l) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
Â Â Â (D) Â Â Â For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title passes,
the property meets either of the following criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5) Â Â Â Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
Â Â Â (E) Â Â Â Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal
corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the
real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based
upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the
commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
Â Â Â (F) Â Â Â If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (C)(l2) and (R)(l)(d) of section 718.01 of the Revised
Code by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has apportioned a portion
of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from
taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit
that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount other than the
amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount
related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
Â Â Â (G) Â Â Â When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
(Ord. 18-3. Passed 2-20-18.)
182.27 CERTIFICATION OF AMOUNTS TO BE PAID MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â On or before the last day of each month, the tax commissioner shall
certify to the director of budget and management the amount to be paid to each
municipal corporation, based on amounts reported on annual returns and
declarations of estimated tax under sections 718.85 and 718.88 of the Revised
Code, less any amounts previously distributed and net of any audit adjustments
made or refunds granted by the commissioner, for the calender month preceding
the month in which the certification is made. Not later than the fifth day of
each month, the director shall provide for payment of the amount certified to
each municipal corporation from the municipal income tax fund, plus a pro rata
share of any investment earnings accruing to the fund since the previous
payment under this section. Each municipal corporation's share of such earnings
shall equal the proportion that the municipal corporation's certified tax
payment is of the total taxes certified to all municipal corporations in that
quarter. All investment earnings on money in the municipal income tax fund
shall be credited to that fund.
Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â If the tax commissioner determines that the amount of tax paid by a
taxpayer and distributed to a municipal corporation under this section for a
taxable year exceeds the amount payable to that municipal corporation under
sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code after accounting for amounts
remitted with the annual return and as estimated taxes, the commissioner shall
proceed according to divisions (A) and (B) of section 5703.77 of the Revised
Code.
(Ord. 18-3. Passed 2-20-18.)
182.28 INFORMATION PROVIDED TO TAX ADMINISTRATORS; CONFIDENTIALITY.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by sections 718.80 to 718.95
of the Revised Code is confidential, and no person shall disclose such
information, except for official purposes, in accordance with a proper judicial
order, or as provided in section 4123.271 or 5703.21 of the Revised Code. The
tax commissioner may furnish the internal revenue service with copies of

a form which does not disclose information with respect to particular
taxpayers.
Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â In May and November of each year, the tax commissioner shall provide
each tax administrator with the following information for every taxpayer that
filed tax returns with the commissioner under sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the
Revised Code and that had municipal taxable income apportionable to the
municipal corporation under this chapter for any prior year:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The taxpayer's name, address, and federal employer identification
number;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â The taxpayer's apportionment ratio for, and amount of municipal
taxable income apportionable to, the municipal corporation pursuant to section
718.82 of the Revised Code;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â The amount of any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward
utilized by the taxpayer;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Whether the taxpayer requested that any overpayment be carried
forward to a future taxable year;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5) Â Â Â The amount of any credit claimed under section 718.94 of the
Revised Code.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â Not later than thirty days after each distribution made to municipal
corporations under section 718.83 of the Revised Code, the tax commissioner
shall provide to each municipal corporation a report stating the name and
federal identification number of every taxpayer that made estimated payments
that are attributable to the municipal corporation and the amount of each such
taxpayer's estimated payment.
Â Â Â (D) Â Â Â Not later than the thirty-first day of January of each year, every
municipal corporation having taxpayers that have made the election allowed
under section 718.80 of the Revised Code shall provide to the tax commissioner,
in a format prescribed by the commissioner, the name and mailing address of up
to two persons to whom the municipal corporation requests that the commissioner
send the information described in divisions (B) and (C) of this section. The
commissioner shall not provide such information to any person other than a
person who is designated to receive the information under this section and who
is employed by the municipal corporation or by a tax administrator, as defined
in section 718.01 of the Revised Code, that administers the municipal
corporation's income tax, except as may otherwise be provided by law.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â The tax commissioner may adopt rules that further govern the
terms and conditions under which tax returns filed with the commissioner under
this chapter, and any other information gained in the performance of the
commissioner's duties prescribed by this chapter, shall be available for
inspection by properly authorized officers, employees, or agents of the
municipal corporations to which the taxpayer's net profit is apportioned under
section 718.82 of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â As used in this division, "properly authorized officer, employee,
or agent" means an officer, employee, or agent of a municipal corporation who
is authorized by charter or ordinance of the municipal corporation to view or
possess information referred to in section 718.13 of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â If, upon receiving the information described in division (B) of
section 718.91 of the Revised Code or division (B) or (C) of this section, a
municipal corporation discovers that it has additional information in its
possession that could result in a change to a taxpayer's tax liability, the
municipal corporation may refer the taxpayer to the tax commissioner for an
audit. Such referral shall be made on a form prescribed by the commissioner and
shall include any information that forms the basis for the referral.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â Upon receipt of a referral under division (F)(1) of this section,
the commissioner shall review the referral and may conduct an audit of the
taxpayer that is the subject of the referral based on the information in the
referral and any other relevant information available to the commissioner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â Nothing in division (F) of this section shall be construed as
forming the sole basis upon which the commissioner may conduct an audit of a
taxpayer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4) Â Â Â Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a municipal corporation
from filing a writ of mandamus if the municipal corporation believes that the
commissioner has violated the commissioner's fiduciary duty as the
administrator of the tax levied by the municipal corporation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Ord. 18-3. Passed 2-20-18.)
182.29 FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual
return. Such return, along with the amount of tax shown to be due on the return
less the amount paid for the taxable year under section 718.88 of the Revised
Code, shall be submitted to the tax commissioner, on a form and in the manner
prescribed by the commissioner, on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth
month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one
calendar year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to
compute the tax due under this chapter, in accordance with sections 718.81,
718.82, and, if applicable, 718.86 of the Revised Code onto its annual return.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â The remittance shall be made payable to the treasurer of state and
in the form prescribed by the tax commissioner. If the amount payable with the
tax return is ten dollars or less, no remittance is required.
Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â The tax commissioner shall immediately forward to the treasurer of
state all amounts the commissioner receives pursuant to sections 718.80 to
718.95 of the Revised Code. The treasurer shall credit ninety-nine and one-half
per cent of such amounts to the municipal income tax fund and the remainder to
the municipal income tax administrative fund established under section 5745.03
of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's identification number. Each return shall be verified by a
declaration under penalty of perjury.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to include, with
each annual tax return, amended return, or request for refund filed with the
commissioner under sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, copies of any
relevant documents or other information.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission
is not available, mail the documents to the tax commissioner. The department of
taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â After a taxpayer files a tax return, the tax commissioner may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal income tax.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c) Â Â Â An extension of time to file under division (D)(l) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with section 718.04 of the Revised Code,
the commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments
otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not otherwise
required to file annual returns.
Â Â Â (E) Â Â Â Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
Â Â Â (F) Â Â Â When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.

defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(l) of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4) Â Â Â "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5) Â Â Â "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to a tax
imposed in accordance with section 718.04 of the Revised Code in that taxable
year and if the affiliated group of corporations filed a consolidated federal
income tax return with respect to that taxable year. The election is binding
for a five- year period beginning with the first taxable year of the initial
election unless a change in the reporting method is required under federal law.
The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-year period
unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
division (B)(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax
commissioner. The tax commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause
shown.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â An election made under division (B)(l) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4) Â Â Â When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1)
or (2) of section 718.06 of the Revised Code is binding upon the tax
commissioner for the remainder of the five-year period.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5) Â Â Â When an election made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code is
terminated, a valid election made under this section is binding upon the tax
administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
Â Â Â (D) Â Â Â A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section 718.81 of the Revised
Code, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section 718.81 of the
Revised Code to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section 718.82 of the Revised
Code, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section 718.82 of the Revised
Code, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4) Â Â Â If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in section 718.82 of the Revised Code, exclude the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the
computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections 718.80 to 718.95 of
the Revised Code on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
Â Â Â (F) Â Â Â Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section 718.82 of the Revised Code by substituting
"consolidated federal taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from"
wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by substituting
"affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears
in that section.
Â Â Â (G) Â Â Â Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under section 718.80 to 718.95 or Chapter 5703 of the
Revised Code to the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation
is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of
such an affiliated group.
(Ord. 18-3. Passed 2-20-18.)
182.31 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
Â Â Â If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section 718.80 of the
Revised Code fails to pay any tax as required under sections 718.80 to 718.95
of the Revised Code, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date
prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in
the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date prescribed for
its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is issued under
section 718.90 of the Revised Code, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 18-3. Passed 2-20-18.)
182.32 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â As used in this section:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(l) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c) Â Â Â On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d) Â Â Â On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c) Â Â Â For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d) Â Â Â For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code and shall
be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in accordance with
section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â (E) Â Â Â An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Ord. 18-3. Passed 2-20-18.)
182.33 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections 718.80 to 718.95
or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the following penalties shall apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections 718.80
to 718.95 of the Revised Code fails to make and file the return within the time
prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax commissioner,
the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars per
month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing
between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on
which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this
division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code fails to do so, the commissioner
may impose a penalty not to exceed the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b) Â Â Â For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
718.80 of the Revised Code fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be
paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to fifteen
per cent of the amount not timely paid.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code that does not contain information
upon which the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains
information that on its face indicates that the return is substantially
incorrect, and the filing of the return in that manner is due to a position
that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent from the return to delay or
impede the administration of sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, a
penalty of up to five hundred dollars may be imposed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding
the greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required
to be shown on the return.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6) Â Â Â If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
section 718.91 of the Revised Code, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
section 718.90 of the Revised Code without regard to any time limitation for
the assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
Â Â Â (D) Â Â Â All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code and shall be
credited and distributed to municipal corporations in the same proportion as
the underlying tax liability is required to be distributed to such municipal
corporations under section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 18-3. Passed 2-20-18.)
182.34 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â If any taxpayer required to file a return under section 718.80 to
718.95 of the Revised Code fails to file the return within the time prescribed,
files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for
the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an assessment
against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the return or
tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's possession.
Â Â Â The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section 718.91 of the Revised Code for the same period of time. There
shall be no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file
a return subject to assessment as required by sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the
Revised Code, or that files a fraudulent return. The commissioner shall give
the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided in section
5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the commissioner shall provide
instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the
petition.
Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
Â Â Â Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the
judgment.
Â Â Â If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
Â Â Â (D) Â Â Â All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
Â Â Â (E) Â Â Â If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
Â Â Â (F) Â Â Â Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
Â Â Â If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section 718.91 of the Revised Code, with
interest on that amount as provided by that section.
(Ord. 18-3. Passed 2-20-18.)
182.35 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections 718.80 to
718.95 of the Revised Code, including assessments, shall be filed with the tax
commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or
excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period allowed by
division (A) of section 718.90 of the Revised Code. The application shall be
filed in the form prescribed by the tax commissioner.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment,
interest shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or
erroneous assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited. (Ord. 18-3.
Passed 2-20-18.)
182.36 AMENDED RETURNS.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section 718.80 of the Revised Code and used to determine the tax due
under sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code must be altered as the
result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether
initiated by the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration
affects the taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall
file an amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the
commissioner requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty
days after the adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal
income tax purposes or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or
the abatement or credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid,
whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated
municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate
return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal
income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the
amended return.
Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section 718.90 of the Revised Code for the
purpose of assessing any additional tax due under this section, together with
any applicable penalty and interest. The amended return shall not reopen those
facts, figures,
computations, or attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject
to assessment that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal tax return.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section 718.91 of the Revised Code, if the application otherwise conforms to
the requirements of that section. An application filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the
time prescribed in section 718.91 of the Revised Code. The application shall
not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal income tax return.
(Ord. 18-3. Passed 2-20-18.)
182.37 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections 718.80 to
718.95 of the Revised Code for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any
return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required
under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a duly
authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to
this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the commissioner,
authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and
place designated in the request.
Â Â Â (B) Â Â Â The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code shall be open to
the tax commissioner's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved
for a period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the
records or documents relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show
whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the
income tax levied by a municipal corporation.
Â Â Â (C) Â Â Â The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
Â Â Â (D) Â Â Â No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 18-3. Passed 2-20-18.)
182.38 CREDITS.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â A credit, granted by resolution or ordinance of a municipal
corporation pursuant to section 718.15 or 718.151 of the Revised Code, shall be
available to a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section 718.80
of the Revised Code, against the municipal corporation's tax on income. A
municipal corporation shall submit the following information to the tax
commissioner on or before the later of January 31 , 2018, or the thirty-first
day of January of the first year in which the taxpayer is eligible to receive
the credit:

and taxpayer under section 718.15 or 718.151 of the Revised Code;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â A copy of the municipal ordinance or resolution authorizing the
agreement entered into between the municipal corporation and the taxpayer.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â Each taxpayer that claims a credit shall submit, with the
taxpayer's tax return, documentation issued by the municipal corporation
granting the credit that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the
credit, the amount of the credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the
tax year to which the credit is to be applied.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by a municipal corporation and taxpayer under section 718.15 or 718.151 of
the Revised Code, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such existing
agreement.
(Ord. 18-3. Passed 2-20-18.)
182.39 RECKLESS VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES.
Â Â Â (A) Â Â Â Except as provided in division (B) of this section, whoever
recklessly violates division (A) of section 718.84 of the Revised Code shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be subject to a fine of
not more than one thousand dollars or imprisonment for a term of up to six

Â Â Â The following definitions shall apply to the lodging excise tax provided for
in this chapter:

public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are offered to guests, in
which, pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code, specifically, Â§5739.01(M) and
Â§5739.09(G), one or more rooms are used for the accommodation of such guests,
whether the rooms are in one or several structures, regardless of whether each
room is accessible through its own keyed entry or several rooms are accessible
through the same keyed entry. In determining the number of rooms, all rooms are
included regardless of the number of structures in which the rooms are situated
or the number of parcels of land on which the structures are located if the
structures are under the same ownership and the structures are not identified
in advertisements of the accommodations as distinct establishments. For the
purposes of this chapter, two (2) or more structures are under the same
ownership if they are owned by the same person, or if they are owned by two (2)
or more persons the majority of the ownership interests of which are owned by
the same person.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â "Transient guest" means a person occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty (30) consecutive days.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â "Permanent resident" means a person or person occupying a room or

Â Â Â Â Â Â (Res. 23-9. Passed 2-21-23.)
185.03 SEMI-ANNUAL PAYMENT.
Â Â Â The lodging excise tax levied by Section 185.01 shall be remitted to New
Lexington on a semi-annual basis based upon lodging furnished to transient
guests within the following semi-annual periods: that period of time between
January 1 through June 30, both inclusive; and that period of time between July
1 through December 31, both inclusive. The semi-annual payment for the January
1 through June 30 semi-annual period shall include all lodging excise taxes
collected for lodging furnished to transient guests during the months of
January, February, March, April, May, and June. The semi-annual payment for the
July 1 through December 31 semi-annual period shall include all lodging excise
taxes collected for lodging furnished to transient guests during the months of

any exempt receipts for the semi-annual period from the gross receipts for the
semiannual period. A hotel's tax liability shall be determined by multiplying
the net taxable receipts for the semi-annual period by three percent (3%) to
arrive at the tax owed. The total payment remitted with the lodging excise tax
return shall be the tax liability plus any charges for late payments.
(Res. 23-9. Passed 2-21-23.)

be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the taxpayer of the

taxpayer to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days after the determination of

private agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of
the person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this section, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A towing service towing a motor vehicle under subsection (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that subsection.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the
vehicle only in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.

private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three
separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. "Private
residential property" does not include any private property on which is located
one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by
two or more persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in
the structure or structures.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section arrives after the motor
vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the
property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
Â Â Â Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders
into storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section. The record shall
include an entry for each such motor vehicle that identifies the motor
vehicleâ€™s license number, make, model and color, the location from which it was
removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the person
from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it has
been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chiefâ€™s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.

storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both
of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 or, if the
vehicle was towed within a municipal corporation that has established fees for
vehicle removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, â€œpersonal itemsâ€ do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty

303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A description of persons authorized to park on the property. If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times, the
times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the
existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this section is
taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with all of
the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â It is located within twenty-five linear miles of the location of
the private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to
a place of storage within twenty-five linear miles.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â It is well-lighted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly scheduled
route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public
transportation is available in the municipal corporation or township in which
the private tow-away zone is located.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If a vehicle is parked on private property that is established
as a private tow- away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section. The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in Ohio R.C. 4505.101. The owner or lienholder of a
vehicle that has been removed under this section, subject to subsection (c) of
this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with subsection (g) of this
section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
Â Â Â The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs taken
under this section. The towing service shall retain the photographs and the
record of the time and date, in electronic or printed form, for at least thirty
days after the date on which the vehicle is recovered by the owner or
lienholder or at least two years after the date on which the vehicle was towed,
whichever is earlier.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under subsection (b)
of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the
municipal corporation concerning all of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The vehicleâ€™s license number, make, model and color;

recovered;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The address of the place from which the vehicle may be recovered.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation
shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed from private property in the
chiefâ€™s jurisdiction that is established as a private tow-away zone of which
the chief has received notice under this section. The record shall include all
information submitted by the towing service. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular vehicle to a person
who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self as the
owner, operator or lienholder of the vehicle, and requests information
pertaining to the vehicle.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three business days of the removal, the towing
service or storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause
a search to be made of either of the following to ascertain the identity of the
owner and any lienholder of the vehicle:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The records of any vendor or vendors, approved by the Registrar

lienholder information.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The towing service or storage facility may search the National
Motor Vehicle Title Information System in order to determine the state in which
the vehicle is titled. The entity that provides the record of the owner and any
lienholder under this division shall ensure that such information is provided
in a timely manner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Subject to subsection (f)(6) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known

with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service utilizing any form
of delivery requiring a signed receipt.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If the vehicle remains unclaimed thirty days after the first
notice is sent, in the manner required under subsection (f)(3)A. of this
section.

this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not
possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under Ohio R.C.
4505.101(B), may initiate the process for obtaining a certificate of title to

Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â A towing service or storage facility that does not receive a signed
receipt of notice, or a notification that delivery was not possible, shall not
obtain, and shall not attempt to obtain, a certificate of title to the motor
vehicle under Ohio R.C. 4505.101(B).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â With respect to a vehicle concerning which a towing service or
storage facility is not eligible to obtain title under Ohio R.C. 4505.101, the
towing service or storage facility need only comply with the initial notice
required under subsection (f)(3)A. of this section.

Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chiefâ€™s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chiefâ€™s or trooperâ€™s duties; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer without notification to
the chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However,
when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an

of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the ownerâ€™s or lienholderâ€™s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the

registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle
also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without retrieving the
vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, â€œpersonal
itemsâ€ do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chiefâ€™s records, and shall furnish

presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealerâ€™s or facilityâ€™s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to

right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
Â Â Â For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC

303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5)
that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
Â Â Â Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
Â Â Â Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
Â Â Â No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â â€œDistractedâ€ means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Using an electronic wireless communications device, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, in violation of that section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â â€œDistractedâ€ does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section

Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â â€œDistractedâ€ does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â â€œUtilityâ€ means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),

utility.
Â Â Â 
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offenderâ€™s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offenderâ€™s payment in full and

resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offenderâ€™s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officerâ€™s law enforcement agency;

assembly areas and route of march would unreasonably interfere with the public
convenience and safe use of the streets and highways.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The parade would require the diversion of so great a number of
police officers to properly police the line of movement, assembly area and
areas contiguous thereto so as to deny normal police protection to the
Municipality.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The parade route of march or assembly areas would unreasonably
interfere with the movement of police vehicles, fire-fighting equipment or
ambulance service to other areas of the Municipality.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
Â Â Â No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
Â Â Â If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
Â Â Â Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
Â Â Â Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Steady Green Signal Indication:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Steady Red Signal Indication:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn

intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Flashing Red Signal Indication:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.

beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A steady yellow â€œXâ€: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red â€œXâ€ signal indication.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â A steady red â€œXâ€: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (ORC 4511.131)
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

â€œwalkâ€ or â€œdonâ€™t walkâ€, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes â€œwalkâ€,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes â€œdonâ€™t
walkâ€, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word â€œwaitâ€ if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Evidence; Tests.Â Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendantâ€™s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
Â Â Â The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that personâ€™s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, â€œemergency
medical technician-intermediateâ€ and â€œemergency medical technician- paramedicâ€
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the personâ€™s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the personâ€™s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the personâ€™s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the personâ€™s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the personâ€™s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
â€œnational highway traffic safety administrationâ€ means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

combination of them that was found;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analystâ€™s or test performerâ€™s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analystâ€™s or test performerâ€™s regular duties;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â An outline of the analystâ€™s or test performerâ€™s education,

of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless

Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendantâ€™s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendantâ€™s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant

section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
Â Â Â As used in this subsection, â€œemergency medical technician-intermediateâ€ and
â€œemergency medical technician-paramedicâ€ have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â General OVI Penalty.Â Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection

controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a driversâ€™ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a driversâ€™ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a driversâ€™
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the driversâ€™ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offenderâ€™s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
driversâ€™ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a driversâ€™ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a driversâ€™ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a driversâ€™ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at driversâ€™ intervention program, that
the operators of the driversâ€™ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offenderâ€™s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

commercial driverâ€™s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with
electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of

by a community addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C.
5119.21, subject to subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the
offender to follow the treatment recommendations of the services provider. The
purpose of the assessment is to determine the degree of the offenderâ€™s alcohol
usage and to determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request
of the court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment
to the court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses
related to alcohol use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offenderâ€™s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

R.C. 2929.28, in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

may order that the cost be paid from the courtâ€™s indigent driversâ€™ alcohol
treatment fund.
Â Â Â (l)Â Â Â Appeal Does Not Stay Operation of License Suspension. If a person
whose driverâ€™s or commercial driverâ€™s license or permit or nonresident

the operation of the suspension.

driverâ€™s license, commercial driverâ€™s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege for ninety days.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Notwithstanding subsections (d)(1)A. to (d)(1)C. of this section,
if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with Ohio R.C.
4511.98, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall
impose upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the
violation under subsections (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as
applicable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom subsection
(d)(1)A of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) under subsection (d)(1)A. of this section and the
assessment of points under subsection (d)(4) of this section, the offender
instead may elect to attend the distracted driving safety course, as described
in Section
303.991. If the offender attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall not be required to pay the fine and
shall not have the points assessed against that offenderâ€™s driverâ€™s license if
the offender submits the written evidence to the court. This subsection does
not apply with respect to any offender in the category of offenders to whom
subsection (d)(1)B., C., or D. of this section applies.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The court may impose any other penalty authorized under Ohio R.C.
2929.21 to 2929.28. However, the court shall not impose a fine or a suspension
not otherwise specified in subsection (d)(1) of this section. The court also
shall not impose a jail term or community residential sanction.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Except as provided in subsection (d)(2) of this section, points
shall be assessed for a violation of subsection (a) of this section in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense
as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based
on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for the purposes of enforcing this
section unless the officer visually observes the operator using, holding, or
physically supporting with any part of the personâ€™s body the electronic
wireless communications device.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A law enforcement officer who stops the operator of a motor vehicle
for a violation of subsection (a) of this section shall inform the operator
that the operator may decline a search of the operatorâ€™s electronic wireless
communications device. The officer shall not do any of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Access the device without a warrant unless the operator
voluntarily and unequivocally gives consent for the officer to access the
device;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Confiscate the device while awaiting the issuance of a warrant to
access the device;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Obtain consent from the operator to access the device through
coercion or any other improper means. Any consent by the operator to access the
device shall be voluntary and unequivocal before the officer may access the
device without a warrant.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â â€œElectronic wireless communications deviceâ€, includes any of the

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driverâ€™s
or commercial driverâ€™s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driverâ€™s or commercial driverâ€™s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driverâ€™s or commercial driverâ€™s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driverâ€™s or commercial driverâ€™s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driverâ€™s or commercial
driverâ€™s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the offenderâ€™s driverâ€™s or commercial driverâ€™s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offenderâ€™s driverâ€™s or commercial driverâ€™s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offenderâ€™s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offenderâ€™s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offenderâ€™s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offenderâ€™s driverâ€™s license, commercial driverâ€™s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

to the operator by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles or a Deputy Registrar under
Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a valid commercial driverâ€™s license issued under Ohio
R.C. Chapter 4506.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â No person shall receive a driverâ€™s license, or a motorcycle
operatorâ€™s endorsement of a driverâ€™s or commercial driverâ€™s license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card unless and until the person
surrenders to the Registrar or a deputy registrar all valid licenses, temporary
instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together
with information that the license, temporary instruction permit, or
identification card is now issued in this state. The Registrar or a deputy
registrar shall destroy any such license, temporary instruction permit, or
identification card that is not returned to the issuing authority.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â No person shall possess more than one valid license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card at any time.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (ORC 4507.02(A))
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two
or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4507.02 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Whoever violates subsection (b) hereof is guilty of a misdemeanor
of the first degree. (ORC 4507.02; 4507.99)

Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Any person who becomes a resident of this State, within thirty days of
becoming a resident, shall surrender any driverâ€™s license, temporary

operate a motor vehicle upon the public roads or highways, the person shall
apply for a temporary instruction permit or driverâ€™s license in this State. If

a strict liability offense and strict liability is a culpable mental state for
purposes of Ohio R.C. 2901.20. The designation of this offense as a strict
liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other offense, for
which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict liability
offense.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, â€œresidentâ€ means any
person to whom any of the following applies:

B. of this section if, at the time of the violation, an emergency existed that
required the holder of the probationary driverâ€™s license to operate a motor
vehicle in violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. of this section; or the
holder was an emancipated minor.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If a person is issued a probationary driverâ€™s license prior to
attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driverâ€™s license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holderâ€™s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months
or the date the holder attains the age of seventeen years, whichever occurs
first.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any person who is subject to the operating restrictions established
under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holderâ€™s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or
subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the violation may
terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this division.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under
subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon
a highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking unless the total number of occupants of the vehicle
does not exceed the total number of occupant restraining devices originally
installed in the motor vehicle by its manufacturer, and each occupant of the
vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or
is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.

determined by publications of the national automobile dealerâ€™s association. The
proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed in
accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operatorâ€™s driverâ€™s license on or about

personâ€™s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the personâ€™s license
on or about the personâ€™s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the personâ€™s

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an

violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person

of two violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11 or Ohio R.C. 4510.111 or 4510.16, or of
a substantially similar municipal ordinance, the court, in addition to any
other sentence that it imposes on the offender may order the immobilization of

responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued

from the court, neither the Ohio Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy
registrar shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of
registration of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the
declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having
jurisdiction of the offense that lead to the order terminates the forfeiture
and notifies the Registrar of the termination. The Registrar shall then take
necessary measures to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased
by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.

on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officerâ€™s view of the interior or visual

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that

section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,

recovered but for the plaintiffâ€™s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

501.05 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
Â Â Â (a) Â Â Â A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the personâ€™s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or

network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,

Municipality for purposes of this section.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that

Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â As used in this section, â€œcomputerâ€, â€œcomputer systemâ€, â€œcomputer
networkâ€, â€œinformation serviceâ€, â€œtelecommunicationâ€, â€œtelecommunications
deviceâ€, â€œtelecommunications serviceâ€, â€œdataâ€, and â€œwritingâ€ have the same

501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense involving misconduct in
office by a public servant as defined in Section
525.01, at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process which commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings thereon are set aside or reversed on appeal.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The personâ€™s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
Â 
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â As used in this section:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessorâ€™s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â â€œIntoxicationâ€ includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â A person acts purposely when it is the personâ€™s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offenderâ€™s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the personâ€™s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
Â Â Â When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the personâ€™s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the personâ€™s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actorâ€™s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actorâ€™s criminal purpose.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â As used in this section, â€œdrug abuse offenseâ€ has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
Â Â Â Â Â Â inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
Â Â Â Â Â Â or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
Â Â Â Â Â Â of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
Â Â Â Â Â Â testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
Â Â Â Â Â Â it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officerâ€™s, agentâ€™s or employeeâ€™s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officerâ€™s, agentâ€™s or employeeâ€™s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a boardâ€™s or personâ€™s office or employment.
Â 
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
Â 
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
Â 
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 REIMBURSEMENT FOR CONFINEMENT EXPENSES.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Any person who has been convicted of an offense other than a minor
misdemeanor, pursuant to ordinance, and confined in the County Jail, shall
reimburse the City for expenses incurred by reason of such confinement,
including but not limited to, the expenses related to the provision of food,
clothing and shelter. The amount of reimbursement shall be determined by a
court at a hearing, pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The City Law Director may institute an appropriate civil action in the
name of the City in the Court of Common Pleas of Perry County, Ohio, to recover
from such confined person reimbursement for the expenses of the personâ€™s
confinement.
(Ord. 86-1. Passed 2-3-86.)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Restitution.Â Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offenderâ€™s crime or the victimâ€™s estate,
in an amount based on the victimâ€™s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victimâ€™s representative, victimâ€™s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutorâ€™s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victimâ€™s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victimâ€™s representative, victimâ€™s attorney, if applicable, or victimâ€™s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victimâ€™s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.Â Â Â The victim, victimâ€™s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victimâ€™s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Fines. A fine in the following amount:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand

($150.00).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.

Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of

eighty days;

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the courtâ€™s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the courtâ€™s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offenderâ€™s jail sentence.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offenderâ€™s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offenderâ€™s participation in the county jail industry program.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:

required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (ORC 2929.24)
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)

Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not

head of the local law enforcement agency shall notify the owner or keeper of
the dog that a hearing will be held by the municipal court or the hearing

why the dog should not be declared potentially dangerous or vicious. The owner
or keeper of the dog shall be served with notice of the hearing and a copy of

opening of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if

Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in

Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â â€œHarmful to juvenilesâ€ means that quality of any material or

excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:

the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or

Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
sexual activity, masturbation, sexual excitement or nudity in a way which tends
to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;

activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

artistic purpose.

seller or an agent or employee of a seller from exercising reasonable diligence
to determine, the following:

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
Â 
Â Â Â (c) Â Â Â Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)
541.02 ARSON.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause or
create a substantial risk of physical harm to any property of another without

Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause
or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that
is not an occupied structure;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Recklessly, by means of fire, explosion, flood, poison gas, poison,
radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or
endangering, a misdemeanor of the second degree. If violation of this section
creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an
aircraft and if the violation creates a risk of physical harm to any person or
if the property involved in a violation is an occupied aircraft, criminal

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
Â 
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offenderâ€™s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offenderâ€™s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offenderâ€™s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
Â 
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting inÂ a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

921.01 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The Rules and Regulations hereinafter set forth shall be considered a
part of the contract with every person, firm, company, or corporation that is
supplied with water through the Water Works System of the City of New
Lexington, Ohio and every such person, firm, company or corporation taking
water shall be considered to have expressed his or their consent to be governed
thereby. The Council reserves the right to alter, amend or add to the Rules and
Regulations at any time.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The supply of water to all parties for any purpose whatever is subject
to the following conditions: The City does not guarantee to the consumer a
fixed or continuous pressure, or does it guarantee the water delivered as to
quality, purity, or temperature, these being subject to the variable conditions
which may arise in the operation and maintenance of the Water Works.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â In case of breaks in mains, services, pumping machinery, reservoirs,
or other water works equipment, and for the purpose of tapping, extending,
repairing, replacing or cleaning mains, the water may be shut off without
giving notice and no claims will be considered for damage of any nature
whatsoever arising from such action. Under ordinary conditions, consumers will
be notified.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The City reserves the right through its authorized agents to enter at
all reasonable hours the premises to which its service extends, for the purpose
of reading, repairing, installing, removing or inspecting meters, or for any
other purposes which it may deem necessary in properly safeguarding the
interests of the City and the consumer. When such access is refused, the water
will be immediately turned off and not turned on again until the request of the
City has been complied with and an "off and on" charge of Fifty Dollars
($50.00) is paid for service within the City or Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00)
for service outside the City.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â A copy of the form to be used for application for water service in the

921.02 WATER METERS.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â All water services must be metered.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â All applications for the use of water from the City must be made in
writing by the Owner of the premises on the form provided by the City. A permit

together with application and fee for the tap must then be presented to the
Water Department Clerk. .
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â One Meter only on a Service Branch, but Extra Second Meters Permitted.
No service branch will be permitted to serve more than one master meter. Where
more than one building, apartment or section is served through one water meter,
and the owner desires to ascertain the amount of water used in such additional
building, apartment or section, the installation of second meters to record
such consumption will be permitted. The cost of installation and maintenance of
such second meter must be borne by the owner, but the Water Department will not
undertake to read such meters and render statements of same on application at
the office. Such statements are for the convenience of the owner only and will
not be recognized by the City in payment of bills.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The City may grant a permit for the installation of more than one
master meter on a service branch supplying an apartment building or a building
containing more than one distinct apartment, when plans showing the piping
arrangements are submitted to and approved by the City. In cases where such
additional meters are permitted, it shall be required: (1) That all meters be
contained compactly or in a meter room, and that each be controlled
independently of the others; (2) That the owner assume all responsibility for
the installation and maintenance of the meters other than that assumed by the

should give street number and if possible, service number.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â On and after the effective date of this section, all water meters
shall be furnished by the City. All meters shall comply with the requirements
or specifications prescribed by the City and shall be of the make, type, model
and design approved and adopted by the City.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Maintenance and Replacement of Meters. The cost of maintenance
including repair or replacement of all meters furnished by the City at its
expense, including those meters whose titles have been assigned to the City by
individual owners according to subsection (j) hereof, will be at the expense of
the City, excepting however, the customer will be charged and held responsible
for all repairs or cost of replacement occasioned by hot water, neglect or any
act of negligence on the part of said customer.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Responsibility for Loss or Theft of Meters. Property owners shall be
held responsible for and shall reimburse the City for the loss or theft of any
meter furnished and maintained as hereinbefore provided.
Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â Transfer of Ownership of Meter to the City. On and after the effective
date of this section, individual meter owners may enter into an agreement with
the City providing for the assignment of title of their meter to the City
provided such meter is in good working order at the time of transfer. In
consideration thereof, the City agrees to keep and maintain said meters so
transferred in repair or replace the same at the expense of the City as
provided for.
Â Â Â (k)Â Â Â A meter shall be removed only by an authorized employee of the Water
Department. Unauthorized persons removing or tampering with meters will be
prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

meter seal has been found broken from any cause whatsoever, the water will be
turned off and will not be turned on until the sum of Fifty Dollars ($50.00)
has been paid to the City as liquidated damages and expenses.
Â Â Â (m)Â Â Â The City reserves the right to remove a meter from any premises and
substitute another meter in its place for the purpose of making repairs or
testing.
Â Â Â (n)Â Â Â The City will, on its initiative, undertake to test any meter, which
in its judgment is registering incorrectly, without charge to the owner.
Â Â Â (o)Â Â Â In cases where the property owner or consumer requests the City to
test the meter owned by such property owner, the City reserves the right to
charge Fifty Dollars ($50.00) for the cost of removing and testing the meter if
the meter is found to be in proper working order.
Â Â Â (p)Â Â Â Meters must be kept freely accessible to meter readers and other
authorized employees of the Water Department and must not be permitted to be
covered with or obstructed by rubbish or other material regardless of whether
such meters are located in meter vaults, meter tile or basements. Meters will
not be permitted to be installed in coal bins or coal cellars. The City
reserves the right to shut off water when violations of this regulation are not
corrected following due notice of such violation to the owner by the City.
Â Â Â (q)Â Â Â All meter installations shall be located as directed by the Water
Department.
(Ord. 09-04. Passed 3-23-09.)
921.03 BILLING AND PAYMENT OF WATER BILLS.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Charges for water used will be based on the meter consumption at the
rates legally adopted by the City.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The reading of meters will be monthly. In cases where no meter reading

purchasing property to ascertain if there are any unpaid water bills
outstanding against the property.
(Ord. 09-04. Passed 3-23-09.)
Â 
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â The owner of any premises shall pay the water charges as they accrue.
An owner may permit a tenant or lessee to be co-named or added to the account
but is not thereby relieved of responsibility for payment and cannot themselves
be removed from the account. Before new tenant or lessee can receive water
service, owner shall see that all bills are current, and that account is not
delinquent. If account is delinquent service shall be terminated until paid in
full.
(Ord. 17-13. Passed 9-18-17.)
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â The Water Department will undertake to deliver bills for water by
depositing the same in the Post Office as a matter of convenience to the owner
or consumer. Failure to receive bills shall not relieve any persons from their
obligations in the payment of such bills.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â When water is turned off on account of any delinquency, it will not be
turned on until all delinquencies have been paid, together with an "off and on"
charge of fifty dollars ($50.00) for service in the City or seventy-five
dollars ($75.00) for service without the City.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â When a consumer has been notified of a leak and repair is not made
within seven (7) calendar days of notice, service may be shut off without
notice.
(Ord. 09-04. Passed 3-23-09.)

by the installation of the building sewer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The building sewer shall be constructed of a size not less than
four inches, internal diameter. All materials used shall be new and of first
quality and acceptable to the Superintendent. The building sewer shall be
constructed of one of the following alternative materials: Extra strength
vitrified pipe, ASTM C700, with precast plastic or rubber gasket ASTM C425, or
chemically welded plastic pipe, ASTM D3034 (SDR-35) with elastomeric gasket
joints per ASTM D3212 of the integral bell type. All joints and connections
shall be made gas tight and water tight. The Authority may require the sewer
tapper to demonstrate the tightness of the joints by such tests as he may deem
necessary and require additional jointing material or concrete collars at any
or all joints.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A four inch building sewer shall have a minimum fall of 1/4 inch
per linear foot of sewer from the building to the public sewer. A six inch
building sewer shall be constructed with a minimum fall of 1/8 inch per linear
foot. Common services for more than one building or services to nonresidential

building sewer and the house plumbing shall be made gas and water tight.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The interior of each length of pipe shall be made perfectly clean
and free from offsets, fins and projections before the next length is connected
thereto. All building sewers shall be graded by line and pole, the line being
first leveled from the building to the public sewer and then lowered at the
down stream end to obtain the required fall.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Any sewer contractor, before laying pipe or making the connection
to any wye, tee, riser or crossover, shall uncover said appurtenances to
ascertain the condition. No sewer pipe shall be laid before the representative
of the Superintendent is on the job. The sewer contractor shall determine the
slope of the building sewer from the elevations of the existing public sewer
connection and the connection at the building, with prescribed minimum slope.
Should there not be enough fall available to provide the minimum slope, the
Superintendent shall be advised immediately. Sewer pipe laying shall start at
the connect to the public sewer. The sewer contractor shall install a tee at
the point of connection to the public sewer and shall provide adequate
facilities to plug this tee and water test the completed building sewer with an
equivalent of 10 feet of water head, in the presence of the Superintendent, or
his authorized agent. Upon satisfactory completion of this test and approval by
the Superintendent, or his authorized agent, the sewer contractor shall connect
the sewer to the building drain. The sewer contractor shall install a joint
adaptor, if necessary, to connect on the building sewer. The Superintendent may
permit or require a low pressure air test.

alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with
properly curved pipe and fittings. Under no conditions shall a 90-degree bend
pipe fitting be installed into any public or private sanitary sewer line. Any
public or private utility service structure or line shall be maintained at a
minimum of five feet horizontal clearance between said building sewer and said
utility, except for water lines which shall be maintained at a minimum of 10
feet horizontal clearance, unless that part of the building sewer that is
located within 10 feet of a water line shall be encased in concrete. No other
utilities will be permitted in the same trench as the building sewer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for
each residence or building; except where one building stands at the rear of
another on an interior lot and separate building sewers cannot be made
available to each building; thence one building sewer maybe extended to serve
both buildings. A permit shall be obtained for each building connected to the
building sewer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, wastewater carried by such drain shall be
lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Foundation drains shall not be connected, either directly or
indirectly to the building sewer or public sewer. If any drains are installed,
carrying surface or subsurface water, they shall be constructed to carry said
water to the street or other natural water courses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Surface water which collects in basement or foundation excavations
shall not be discharged at any time into the building sewer. If the building
sewer is completed before the house plumbing can be connected thereto, the
building or sewer tapper shall keep the end of the building sewer tightly
closed at all times with a plumber's plug or other water tight plug in order to
prevent said surface or ground water from entering the building sewer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â Old or existing building sewers may be used in connection with new
building or alterations only when it can be demonstrated that they conform in
all respects to the requirements contained herein for new building sewers.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â Building sewers shall not be constructed closer than three feet to
any exterior wall, cellar, basement or cistern nor shall they have less than
two feet of earth or stone cover.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (13)Â Â Â All excavation for sewers shall be by open cut from the surface.
The sides of the trench shall be substantially vertical, using such sheeting
and bracing as may be necessary to accomplish this result. The bottom of the
excavation shall be shaped to fit the lower half of the sewer so that the pipe
will have uniform bearing from end to end. In the event the trench is excavated
below the required grade of the pipe, the excess space shall be filled with pea
gravel or stone not over 3/4 inch in diameter. The width of the trench at the
top of the pipe shall not exceed two feet plus the outside diameter of the pipe
nor shall the width at that point be less than one foot plus the outside
diameter of the pipe.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (14)Â Â Â The Authority cannot guarantee the exact location of any existing
wye, tee, riser, or crossover. The connection of the building sewer into the
public sewer shall be made at a riser, tee, or wye, if such outlet is available
at a suitable location. Where no properly located outlet is available in the
public sewer, the owner shall at his expense, cut a neat hole into the public
sewer to receive the building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at
an angle of about 45Â° and at the location specified by the Superintendent. The
connection of the building sewer to the public sewer shall, in general, be
above and near the spring line of the sewer, but never in the top of the public
sewer. A 45Â° well may be used to make such connection, with the spigot end cut
so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. A smooth, neat
joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by approved
waterproof joint material before encasing in concrete. Concrete encasement
shall not be considered waterproof. Special fittings may be used for the
connection only when approved by the Superintendent. Any damage to the public
sewer pipe during installation of the connection shall require replacement of
the entire length of sewer pipe damaged, at the sewer contractor's expense.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (15)Â Â Â The person to whom a building sewer permit is issued shall be
responsible for obtaining any required permits to open cut any street, road or
alley from the appropriate political body, official or person having authority
or jurisdiction over such work.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (16)Â Â Â The building sewer shall be backfilled to an elevation at least
six inches over the top of the pipe by tamping in six layers. Soil containing
stones larger than three inches, in the greatest dimension, shall not be used
for backfill. The balance of the backfill may be deposited in any manner which
will not damage the pipe or disturb the alignment or grade of the sewer; except
that the balance of the backfilling shall be done in such a manner and with
such material as may be required by the permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (17)Â Â Â For new connections into the sanitary sewers, the connection
methods must be approved by the Authority prior to initiating construction of
the building sewer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (18)Â Â Â The permit holder will be required to repair or restore any drains
or service lines damaged or disturbed by him during the construction of the
building sewer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (19)Â Â Â All excavations for building sewer installation shall be
adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from
hazard. Streets, sidewalks, driveways, sewers, utilities, and other public or
private property disturbed in the course of work shall be restored in a manner
satisfactory to the Superintendent. No sewer contractor shall open any pavement
on any public or private property without first receiving written permission
from the Superintendent or proper authorities. At least 48 hours notice shall
be given for this permission. Where the trench method is used through paved or
unpaved streets, roads, driveways, alleys, etc., it will be necessary to use
granular material, preferably sand or limestone screenings, for backfill. It
shall be placed in layers of not more than six inches and tamped with a
mechanical tamp or puddled in layers at the direction of the Superintendent.
After the backfill is thoroughly compacted, it will be necessary to replace the
pavement with the same type of materials as was removed, and in no case shall
substitute paving materials be used without first securing the approval of the
proper authority. All surplus excavation must be removed from the site to a
location satisfactory to the Superintendent, leaving the berms and pavement in
substantially the same condition as before construction started. All of the
above mentioned work and material shall be performed in accordance with the
standard specifications of the Ohio Department of Transportation. At all
locations where the building sewer passes under another sewer, drainage pipe,
water main or other utility, the line passed under must be properly supported
and an extra precaution will be required in backfilling and tamping the trench
in order to avoid any danger of a break, settlement, or crack in the line
passed under.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (20)Â Â Â The Authority may install a â€œYâ€ branch if it deems it advisable
and said branch can be used by adjacent property owners.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (21)Â Â Â A building sewer permit shall be required for all repair work
performed by a sewer contractor, except cases where excavation is not
necessary. In the case of stoppages, it shall be the responsibility of the
sewer contractor to uncover the wye, tee, or riser, if the property is on the
same side as the main sewer. When the property is on the opposite side, the end
of the crossover shall be uncovered to determine where the trouble lies. If the
stoppage is found to be either in the public sewer or in the public crossover,
the sewer contractor shall notify the Superintendent immediately, whose
responsibility it shall be to repair same. The cost of the building sewer
permit will then be returned to the sewer contractor. If the stoppage is
located anywhere else in the line, it shall be the responsibility of the owner
to repair same at his own cost and expense.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (22)Â Â Â If any sewer contractor shall neglect or refuse to comply with the
rules and regulations herein set forth, within 24 hours after receiving written
notice from the Superintendent, the Authority will proceed with the work and
the cost involved will be charged to the sewer contractor. In cases where it is
necessary for the Authority to proceed with the work, no further building sewer
permits will be granted to the sewer contractor until he has satisfactorily
complied with the orders of the Superintendent or completely reimbursed the
Authority for any cost involved. The sewer contractor shall be required, for a
period of one year after the completion of the work, to make all necessary
repairs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (23)Â Â Â In any case where the nature of the business or industry may
create an environmental problem, the Authority may require that the following
data and items be filed at such time as the application for building sewer
permit:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A written statement indicating the nature of the business, the
source and amount of water to be used, the amount of water to be discharged,
along with its present or expected bacterial, physical, chemical, radioactive,
or other pertinent characteristics of quality.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A plan and/or map of the building, works or complex, with each

process facilities, pretreatment facilities, waste stream control and potential
industrial waste problems under the specific supervision and control of a
person or persons who have been certified by an appropriate state agency as
properly qualified to supervise such facilities, when required by said state
agency.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â An agreement to provide reports on raw materials entering the
process or support systems, intermediate materials, final products and waste
by-products, as those factors may affect waste control.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â An agreement to maintain records and file reports on the final
disposal of the specific liquids, solids, sludges, oils, radioactive materials,
solvents or other wastes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â An agreement that, if any industrial process is to be altered so
as to add or delete a process waste or potential waste, written notification
shall be given to the Authority in advance and approval of the Authority and
any necessary regulatory agency obtained.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â An agreement that no Industrial User shall ever increase the use
of process water or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial
or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a
pretreatment standard or requirement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (24)Â Â Â Following construction of a building sewer, the property owner
shall own, maintain, repair or replace the building sewer from the building
foundation to the publicly owned sewer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (25)Â Â Â If the Authority receives a service call for a property to
investigate a sewage backup and performs services to clean a building sewer for
which the owner is responsible, the Authority may charge the owner for labor,
material and equipment costs incurred. Such charges may be placed on the
owner's sewer service bill.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Discharges to the Public Sewers.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any stormwater,
surface water, ground water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated
cooling water or unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Stormwater, surface drainage, subsurface drainage, groundwater,
roof runoff, cooling water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be
discharged to such sewers as are specifically designated as storm sewers or to
a natural outlet approved by the local authorities. Industrial cooling water or
unpolluted processed waters may be discharged, on approval of the local
authorities, to a storm sewer or natural outlet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Any existing clear water connections to sanitary sewers shall be
connected into an available storm sewer or shall be disconnected above ground
in the manner approved by the Superintendent. The owner of any building
situated within the City shall be required, at his expense, to disconnect all
existing roof drains from sanitary sewers in accordance with the provisions of
this section within 90 days after the date of official notice to do so.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged, directly or
indirectly any pollutant or wastewater which will interfere with the operation
or performance of the POTW. These general prohibitions apply to all Users of a
POTW whether or not the User is subject to National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards (40 CFR Part 403) or any other National, State, or Local Pretreatment
Standards or Requirements.

925.03 USER CHARGE REGULATION.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Deficit Prohibited. As part of the annual review provided herein, the
Authority or other representative shall make an estimate of the revenues and
expenses for the next year. After deducting:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1) Â Â Â The estimated operation and maintenance costs,
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2) Â Â Â The estimated debt service costs, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Â Â Â The repair and replacement reserve payment from the total
estimated revenues and net carryover from the previous year, the system shall
maintain a positive working capital.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Use of Revenue. The funds received from the collection of the rates
and charges provided in this regulation shall be deposited as received by the
Authority into a separate fund designated the â€œNew Lexington Sewer Fund.â€
Disbursements from the fund may be made for operation and maintenance costs,
debt service costs, and payments to the â€œRepair and Replacement Fundâ€, as well
as payments to the Capital Improvements Fund used for enlargement of the
collection, treatment and disposal capacity of the system. The City Treasurer
of the Authority shall separately invest the funds of the system and pay an
investment earnings to the â€œNew Lexington Sewer Fundâ€, the â€œNew Lexington
Repair and Replacement Fundâ€ or the â€œNew Lexington Capital Improvements Fund.â€
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Free Service Prohibited. Service will be provided to the users of the
system in accordance with the terms of this regulation. No user shall be
provided service without payment of sewer service charges in proportion to the
service available to such user. No one, including the Authority, shall
subsidize the cost of operating, maintaining or replacement of the sewage
disposal system.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Base User Charge. Charges for wastewater services shall be determined
in accordance with the terms of this regulation and shall not be provided
without charge to any users. User charges shall be determined on the basis of
water use on a cost per 1,000 gallons used monthly (see Section
921.09 ). User charge rates will be proportionate to the sewage disposal system
operation, maintenance and replacement costs incurred plus a charge to recover
the proportionate share of capital costs for sewage treatment plant
improvements. The sewer service charge shall consist of the sum of the
Operation, Maintenance and Replacement Rate, and the Debt Capital Improvements
Rate calculated as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Operation, maintenance and replacement rate (OMR). A proportionate
rate for the operation, maintenance and replacement of the sewage disposal
system shall be charged to all users based upon the following formula:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â OMR= A/V
Â Â Â Where A = Total annual operation, maintenance and replacement costs for the
wastewater treatment plant and collection system.
Â Â Â V = Total metered volume of water used per year on the system for those
customers on both the water and sewer system in 1,000 gallon increments.
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Debt/capital improvements charge (DCIC) . The proportionate rate
for repayment of all local share capital costs associated with the construction
of the sewage improvements shall be charged to all users based upon the
following formula:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â DCIC = B
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  V
Where B = Total amortized annual debt/capital improvements costs.
Â Â Â V = Total metered volume of water used per year on the system for those
customers on both the water and sewer system in 1,000 gallon increments.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Determination of Charges. The monthly sewer service charge for each
user shall be calculated by multiplying the currently adopted User Charge and
Debt/Capital Improvements Charge determined under subsection (d) by the actual
water meter reading in 1,000 gallon increments.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Annual Review of User Charges.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The user charges shall be reviewed annually to accomplish the
following purposes:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â To maintain the proportionate distribution of operation and
maintenance and replacement costs among users and user classes; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â To generate sufficient revenue to pay the total operation,
maintenance, replacement, capital and working capital costs of the sewage
disposal system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The annual review of the user charges shall be conducted by the
Authority or by a consulting engineer. A written report shall be prepared and
submitted to the New Lexington City Council on or before July 1st of each year.
The report shall summarize actual operations for the year just ended and, based
upon at least two yearsâ€™ projections (the current year and the next year),
shall recommend a rate increase or decrease effective January 1st of the next
year. At the time recommended in the report, the City shall, by appropriate
ordinance, set the schedule of rates and charges for the users of the system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â In addition to the authority of the City Council to increase or
decrease rates on January 1st of each year, the Council may, at any time,
increase or decrease rates if the Council determines a modification of the
rates is required in order to comply with this regulation, any revenue bond
resolution, or to adjust rates to reflect updated costs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Following the annual review, the Authority shall promptly notify
each user, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate adjustments, if any,
and that portion of the sewer service charge which is attributable to
operation, maintenance and replacement costs of the system.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Billing Procedures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The sewer service charges established by this regulation shall be
billed after the service is rendered. The Authority shall bill for sewer
service by the first day of the month.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Bills shall be mailed to the owner of the property at the mailing
address of the property serviced unless the owner shall, in writing, request
the bill be sent to a different mailing address of the owner. Except as
provided below, bills shall not be sent to a lessee of the property. In the
case where the land is separately owned from the building, the bill shall be
sent to the mailing address of the owner of the building.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â After the effective date of this regulation, the bill may continue
to be sent to the mailing address for a lessee until one of the following
occurs:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The lessee moves out of the building; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The lessee is delinquent twice within a calendar year.
Upon the occurrence of subsection (g)(3)A. or B. hereof, the bill shall be sent
to the mailing address of the owner of the property without exception.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Changes of Address or Ownership.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Upon the change of his or her mailing address, an owner of a
property served by the sewage disposal system shall inform the Authority, in
writing, of the change. Failure to inform the Authority of a change of address
shall not excuse an owner from any payment penalties incurred because of the
failure to report an address change.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Prior to the sale of a property, the present owner shall contact
the Authority to arrange for pro-ration of the final bill. The final bill shall
be sent to the mailing address specified by the present owner. Failure of a
previous owner to comply with this part shall not excuse the new owner from
responsibility for any and all delinquencies certified pursuant to the Ohio
Revised Code, current charges or penalties remaining unpaid by the previous
owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Prior to the sale of a property, the purchaser shall contact the
Authority to arrange for a pro-ration of the first bill and to inform the
Authority of the mailing address of the new owner. Failure to comply with this
part shall not excuse the new owner from responsibility for any and all
delinquencies certified pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code, current charges or
penalties remaining unpaid by the previous owner.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Payments and Penalties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The sewer service charge bill shall be due by the 15th day of each
month. If the 15th day of the month falls on a Sunday or holiday, the sewer
service charge bill shall be due the following business day (including
Saturday).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Checks and money orders shall be payable to the City of New
Lexington.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Payments sent by mail and postmarked by the 16th day of the month
will be accepted without the imposition of a payment penalty. If the 16th day
of the month falls on a Sunday or holiday, the payment sent by mail must be
postmarked no later than the following business day (including Saturday).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Payments received or postmarked after the 16th day of the month or
the first business day thereafter (including Saturday) shall be subject to a
payment penalty of ten (10) percent of the original amount billed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â A bill that remains unpaid for sixty (60) days after its due date
will be subject to a second payment penalty of ten (10) percent of the original
amount billed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â If a bank should return a check for insufficient funds, an account
will be subject to an insufficient funds charge of ten (10) dollars and require
the overdue amount to be paid in cash.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Upon the claim of a person that the return of a check for
insufficient funds was a bank error, the Authority may waive an insufficient
funds charge and/or accept payment by check if the bank supplies adequate
documentation of its error.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Generally, a person should contact the Authority if he or she fails
to receive a bill by the 5th day of each month. Upon a claim of a person that a
bill was not received:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If the records of the Authority show the bill was duly mailed to
the last reported mailing address, the person shall be responsible for timely
payment of the bill.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If the records of the Authority show the bill was not duly mailed
to the last reported mailing address, the Authority may either:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Issue a bill due ten (10) days from the date of mailing; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Add the unpaid charge to the following month's bill without a
penalty.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â In utilizing the U.S. Postal Service for delivery of their payment
of a sewer service charge, users assume responsibility for any failure of the
U.S. Postal Service to deliver the payment to the Authority. Accordingly the
Authority shall not waive payment penalties for any person claiming that the
U.S. Postal Service failed to deliver a payment.
Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â Delinquencies. Any unpaid billings, together with accrued penalties,
shall be annually certified to the County Auditor, pursuant to the Ohio Revised
Code, who shall place such delinquencies upon the real property tax duplicate
for the property receiving sewage service. Such delinquencies shall be a lien
upon the property from the date the delinquency is placed upon the real
property tax duplicate and shall be collected in the same manner as other real
estate taxes. Failure to pay delinquencies certified may result in a
foreclosure of the property by the County Prosecutor. This part shall be in
addition to all other collection remedies provided by law including an action
in Small Claims Court.
Â Â Â (k)Â Â Â Other Charges by Agreement. The Authority may, in special cases,
establish additional charges for wastes of unusual strength or composition
which are accepted for treatment.
Â Â Â (l)Â Â Â Disconnection or Reconnection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A user who certifies his or her building is not habitable may
request the Authority to disconnect a building from the sewage disposal system.
Upon such request, the Authority shall remove or close the water supply line.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Thereafter, the owner of the premises shall not allow the building
to be utilized for human occupancy as a residence or place of employment and
the Authority shall not bill for sewer service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Violation of subsection (l)(2) hereof will subject the owner to the
mandatory connection provisions of this regulation and Ohio law.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â A person or subsequent owner of a property disconnected who
disconnects from the sewage disposal system may later request to be
reconnected. Upon approval by the Authority, the Authority shall reopen the
water line.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The charge for disconnection or reconnection shall be $25.00 paid
to the Authority before performance of the work.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Ord. 92-23. Passed 10-5-92.)

structure with an opening of no less than 24 inches diameter and an internal
diameter of no less than 36 inches containing flow measuring, recording, and
sampling equipment as required by the Authority to assure compliance with this
chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The Authority will evaluate the complete disclosure form and data
furnished by the discharger and may require additional information. Within 30
days after full evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished, the Authority
shall notify the discharger of the Authority's acceptance thereof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The Authority reserves the right to amend this regulation and the
terms and conditions hereof in order to assure compliance by the Authority with
applicable laws and regulations. All National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards adopted after the promulgation of this chapter shall be adopted by
the Authority as part of this regulation. Where a discharger, subject to a
National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, has not previously submitted a
required disclosure, the discharger shall file a disclosure form with the
Authority within 90 days after the promulgation of the Applicable National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard by the U.S. EPA. In addition, any discharger
operating on the basis of a previous filing of a disclosure statement, shall
submit to the Authority within 90 days after the promulgation of any applicable
National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the additional information required
herein.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Regulated Nonresidential Discharges.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In cases where the character of sewage or industrial waste from any
manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises shows excessive flow
rates or concentration of pollutants such that it imposes an unreasonable
burden upon the sewage collection, pumping, or treatment works greater than
that imposed by the average sewage entering the sewage system, the Authority
may:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Comply such manufacturing or industrial plant, building, or
premises to pretreat such sewage in such manner as specified by the Authority
before discharging it into the sewerage system;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Require flow control or equalization of such wastes so as to
avoid any slug loads or excessive loads that may be harmful to the treatment
works; and/or,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Require payment of a surcharge on any excessive loadings
discharged to the treatment works to cover the additional costs of treating
such wastes.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Limitations on Wastewater Strength.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â National categorical pretreatment standards as promulgated by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to the Act and amended
thereto shall be met by all dischargers of the regulated industrial categories.
An application for modification of the national categorical pretreatment
standards may be considered for submittal to the Regional Administrator by the
Authority, when the Authority's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent
removal of the pollutants as defined by 40 CFR 403.7.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW shall
be met by all dischargers which are subject to such standards in any instance
in which they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or
those in this or any other applicable ordinance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The Authority reserves the right to amend any ordinance and
administrative orders to provide for more stringent limitations or requirements
on discharges to the Authority's treatment system where deemed necessary to
comply with the objectives of an ordinance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â No discharger shall increase the use of potable or process water in
any way, nor mix separate waste streams for the purpose of diluting a discharge
as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve
compliance with the standards set forth in these regulations or any ordinance
and administrative orders.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Supplementary limitations. No industrial discharger shall discharge
wastewater containing concentrations of the materials contained in the
administrative orders which state the most limits between the Categorical
Standards and local limits. The Authority shall issue administrative orders to
any industrial user to require compliance with any requirements under these
regulations, including applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standards, other
discharge limits and reporting requirements. The Authority may impose mass
limitations on dischargers which are using dilution to meet the Pretreatment
Standards or requirements of these regulations, or in other cases where the
imposition of mass limitations is deemed appropriate by the Authority.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Reporting Requirements for Discharger.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance by the discharger with applicable Pretreatment Standards set forth
in these regulations or no longer than 90 days following commencement of the
introduction of wastewater into the Authority's treatment system by a new
discharger, any discharger subject to these regulations shall submit to the
Authority a report indicating the actual nature and concentration of all
prohibited or regulated substances contained in its discharge, and the actual
average and maximum daily flow in gallons. The report shall state whether the
applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements are being met on a consistent
basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to
bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable Pretreatment Standards
or Requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative
of the discharger, and certified to by a qualified engineer (licensed to
practice in the State of Ohio).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Periodic compliance reports. Any discharger subject to a
Pretreatment Standard set forth in these regulations, after the compliance date
of such Pretreatment Standard, or in the case of a new discharger, after
commencement of the discharge to the Authority, shall submit to the Authority
on a quarterly basis, unless required more frequently by the Authority, a
report indicating the nature and concentration, of prohibited or regulated
substances in the effluent which are limited by the Pretreatment Standards
hereof. In addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period reported.
Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement provided, however,
where cost or feasibility considerations justify, the Authority may accept
reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The
Authority, for good cause shown considering such factors as local high or low
flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, or other extenuating factors may authorize
the submission of said reports on months other than those specified above.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Reports of discharger shall contain results of sampling and
analysis of the discharger, including the flow and the nature and
concentration, or production and mass where required by the Authority. The
frequency of monitoring by the discharger shall be as prescribed in the
applicable Pretreatment Standard of these regulations. All analyses shall be
performed in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto.
Â Â Â (Comment: Where 40 CFR, Part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical
technique for the pollutant in question, sampling, and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication,
Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for
Priority Pollutants, latest edition and amendments thereto, or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by the administrator of the U.S.
EPA).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If during sampling, violations of the limits occur, the
industrial user must notify the Authority within 24 hours of receiving
verification of violation. The industrial user shall resample and submit the
results within 30 days from receipt of initial sampling results.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Monitoring facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Each discharger shall provide and operate at the discharger's own
expense, a monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of each sewer discharge to the authority. Each monitoring facility
shall be situated on the discharger's premises, except where such a location
would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the discharger, the Authority
may concur with the facility being constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area providing that the facility is located so that it will not be obstructed
by landscaping or parked vehicles.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to
allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition at the expense of the discharger.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within 120 days of receipt of a building sewer
permit by discharger. All new sources must have the monitoring facility on line
prior to the initiation of discharge to the sewer system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Inspection and sampling. The Authority may inspect the monitoring
facilities of any discharger to determine compliance with the requirements of
this chapter. The discharger shall allow the Authority or its representatives,
upon presentation of credentials of identification, to enter upon the premises
of the discharger at all reasonable hours, for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, or records examination. The Authority shall have the right to set on
the discharger's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or meeting operations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Confidential information. Information and data furnished to the
Authority with respect to the nature and frequency of discharge shall be
available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless
the discharger specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Authority that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection
as trade secrets or proprietary information of the discharger. When requested
by a discharger furnishing a report, the portions of a report which may
disclose trade secrets, or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon written request to
governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, State Disposal System permit and/
or the Pretreatment Programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report
shall be available for use by the State or any State agency in judicial review
or enforcement proceedings involving the discharger furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information. Information accepted by the Authority as
confidential, shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the
general public by the Authority until and unless a ten-day notification is
given to the discharger.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Pretreatment Interceptors.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All food establishments which maintain a kitchen or other
facilities for the preparation of food may be required by the Authority to have
a grease interceptor of sufficient capacity, except such interceptor shall not
be required for private residential dwellings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Other nonresidential users may be required by the Authority to
install grease, oil and sand interceptors of sufficient capacity if in the
opinion of the Authority, they are necessary to protect the sewerage system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â All interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials
capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall
be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped with easily removable
covers which, when bolted in place, shall be gastight and watertight. All
interceptors shall be located as to be readily accessible for cleaning and
inspection.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Pretreatment Costs. Any pretreatment facility or flow-equalizing
facilities required by the Authority shall be constructed, owned, maintained,
repaired and replaced at the cost of the owner. Prior to construction of such
facilities, the owner shall submit and receive the Authority's approval of
detailed design plans for the facilities. Thereafter, such facilities shall be
maintained continuously in satisfactory operation at the cost of the owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â At no time shall the pretreatment system be bypassed. If a bypass
is necessary, the Authority must be notified at least ten days in advance if
the bypass is planned. If the bypass is accidental, the Industrial User shall
notify the Authority orally within 24 hours of becoming aware of the bypass.
Within five days of orally notifying the Authority, a written description of
the bypass, its cause, its duration and actions to rectify the problem shall be
submitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All measurements, tests, and analysis of the characteristics of
waters and wastes to which reference is made in these regulations shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of â€œStandard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater,â€ unless such standards conflict with
regulations promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in which
case, the regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency shall
govern. Sampling methods, location, times, duration, and frequencies shall be
determined on an individual basis subject to approval by the Superintendent.
All costs incident to sampling and analysis shall be borne by the owner. Such
costs incurred by the Authority shall be billed annually to the owner, based on
actual cost to the Authority, plus reasonable overhead.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Pretreatment Reporting. Any nonresidential user subject to a
Pretreatment Standard, after the compliance date of such Pretreatment Standard,
or, in the case of a New User or New Source, after commencement of the
discharge, shall submit to the Authority during the months of June and
December, unless required more frequently in the Pretreatment Standard or by
the Authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants
in the effluent which are limited by such Pretreatment Standards. In addition,
this report shall include a record of all daily flows which during the
reporting period exceeded the average daily flow. At the discretion of the
Authority and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates,
holidays, budget cycles, etc. the Authority may alter the months during which
the reports are to be submitted.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Pretreatment Monitoring.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Each nonresidential user may be required to construct and maintain
one or more control manholes or access points to facilitate observation,
measurement and sampling of his wastes including domestic sewage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Control manholes or access facilities shall be located and built in
a manner acceptable to the Authority. If measuring devices are to be
permanently installed they shall be of a type acceptable to the Authority.
Plans for the installation of the control manholes or access facilities and
related equipment shall be approved by the Authority prior to the beginning of
construction.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of
waters and wastes to which reference is made in this regulation shall be
determined in accordance with Standard Methods and in accordance with 40 CFR
136 entitled â€œGuidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of
Pollutants,â€ and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon
suitable samples taken at such control manhole.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole at which the
building sewer is connected to the public sewage system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analysis
involved will determine whether a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of
a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and Suspended Solids (SS) analyses are obtained
from twenty-four hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are determined
from periodic grab samples.
Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â Accidental Discharges. No statement contained in this section shall be
construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the
Authority and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual
strength or character may be accepted by the Authority for treatment, subject
to payment therefor by the industrial concern in proportion to cost and
consistent with the user charge system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Each nonresidential user may be required to provide protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this
Regulation. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials
shall be provided and maintained at the cost of the owner. Detailed plans
showing facilities and operating procedures to provide such protection shall be
submitted for review by the Authority, and shall be approved by the Authority
before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve the nonresidential user from the
responsibility to modify the facility as necessary to meet the requirements
contained in this regulation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If, for any reason, a nonresidential user does not comply with or
will be unable to comply with any prohibition or limitations herein, the user
shall immediately notify the Authority that corrective action may need to be
taken to protect the treatment plant. In addition, a written report addressed
to the Authority detailing the date, time, and discharge, and corrective action
taken to prevent future discharges, shall be filed by the user within 5 days of
the occurrence of the noncomplying discharge. Any user who discharges a slug of
prohibited materials shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the
Authority's treatment system, in addition to the amount of fines imposed on the
authority on account thereof under State or Federal law.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on
discharger's premises, advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug
or accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause
or discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedure.
(Ord. 92-23. Passed 10-5-92.)
925.05 MISCELLANEOUS.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Liberal Interpretation. This regulation shall be interpreted liberally
to effectuate its broad remedial purpose of protection of the public health,
safety and welfare. Absent a showing of actual abuse of discretion, the
Authority's interpretation of the regulation shall have a strong presumption of
validity.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Grievances and Appeals.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Any user aggrieved by a decision of the Authority under this
regulation may file a written grievance with the Authority. The written
grievance shall set forth the substance of the Authority's decision and the
basis of the user's complaint.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The Authority shall investigate the grievance and issue a written
determination. The determination should include the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Name, address and location of the premises of the user;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A summary of the user's claim;

Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â No legal action in the courts of the state or federal government
shall be initiated by any user until completion of this administrative remedy.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Records Retention. All dischargers subject to this regulation shall
retain and preserve for no less than three years, any records, books,
documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence and any and all summaries
thereof, relating to monitoring, sampling and chemical analysis made by or in
behalf of a discharger in connection with its discharge. All records which
pertain to matters which are the subject of administrative adjustment or any
other enforcement or litigation activities brought by the Authority pursuant
hereto shall be retained and brought by the Authority pursuant hereto shall be
retained and preserved by the discharger until all enforcement activities have
concluded and all period of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have
expired. (Ord. 92-23. Passed 10-5-92.)
925.99 ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Emergency Suspension of Service and Discharge Permits. The Authority
may for good cause suspend the wastewater treatment service to a discharger
when it appears to the Authority that an actual or threatened discharge
presents an imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons,
substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons, substantial danger to
the environment, interferes with the operation of the Authority's treatment
system, or violates any pretreatment limits imposed by this regulation. Any
discharger notified of the suspension of the Authority's wastewater treatment
service shall within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the
Authority, cease all discharges.
Â Â Â Â The Authority shall have the authority and procedures to immediately and
effectively halt or prevent any discharge which reasonably appears to present
an imminent danger to the health and welfare of persons. In the event of
failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order
within the specified time, the Authority shall commence judicial proceedings
immediately thereafter to compel the discharger's compliance with such order.
Â Â Â The Authority shall reinstate the wastewater treatment service and terminate
judicial proceedings pending proof by the discharge of the elimination of the
noncomplying discharge or conditions creating the threat of imminent or
substantial danger as set forth above.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Revocation of Treatment Services. The Authority may terminate the
wastewater treatment services to any discharger which:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Fails to factually report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Fails to report significant changes in wastewater constituents or
characteristics;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Refuses reasonable access to the discharger's premises by
representatives of the City for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Violates the conditions of this regulation, or any final judicial
order entered within respect thereto.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Notification of Violation; Administrative Adjustment. Whenever the
Authority finds that any discharger has engaged in conduct which justifies
termination of a wastewater treatment service, the Authority shall serve or
cause to be served upon such discharger, a written notice either personally or
by certified mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged
violation. Within 30 days of the date of receipt of the notice, the discharger
shall respond personally or in writing to the Authority, advising of its
position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter, the parties shall meet to
ascertain the veracity of the allegations and where necessary, establish a plan
for the satisfactory correction thereof.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Show Cause Hearing. Where revocation of treatment services is not
corrected by timely compliance by means of administration adjustment, the
Authority may order any discharger to show cause before the Authority or its
duly authorized representative, why the proposed service termination action
should not be taken. A written notice shall be served on the discharger by
personal services, certified or registered, return receipt requested,
specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the Authority or its
designee regarding the violation, the reasons why the enforcement action is to
be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the discharger to show
cause before the Authority why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served no less than ten days before
the hearing. Service may be made on any agent, officer, or authorized
representative of a discharger. The proceedings at the hearing shall be
considered by the Authority which shall then enter appropriate orders with
respect to the alleged improper activities of the discharger. Appeal of such
orders may be taken by the discharger in accordance with applicable local or
state law.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Judicial Proceedings. Following the entry of any order by the
Authority in respect to the conduct of a discharger contrary to revocation of
treatment services hereof, the attorney for the Authority may, following the
authorization of such action by the Authority, commence an action for
appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the appropriate local court.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Enforcement Actions; Annual Publication. A list of all significant
dischargers which were the subject of enforcement proceedings of this chapter
during the 12 previous months, shall be annually published by the Authority in
the largest daily newspaper, published in the municipality in which the
Authority is located, summarizing the enforcement actions taken against the
discharger's during the same 12 months whose violations remained uncorrected 45
or more days after notification of noncompliance; or which have exhibited a
pattern of noncompliance over that 12 month period, or which involve failure to
accurately report noncompliance.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Right of Appeal. Any discharger or any interested party shall have the
right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the Authority on any
matter covered by this regulation and shall be entitled to a prompt written
reply. In the event that such inquiry is by a discharger and delays with
matters of performance or compliance with this regulation for which enforcement
activity relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a
discharger's request shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipt of
the aforesaid written reply. Appeal of any final judicial order entered
pursuant to this regulation may be taken in accordance with local and state
law.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Operating Upsets. Any discharger which experiences an upset in
operations which places the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance
with this regulation shall inform the Authority thereof within 24 hours of
first awareness of the commencement of the upset. Where such information is
given orally, a written follow-up report thereof shall be filed by the
discharger with the Authority within five days. The report shall specify:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset's impact
on a discharger's compliance status.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance.
Â Â Â A documented and verified bonafide operating upset shall be an affirmative
defense to any enforcement action brought by the Authority against a discharger
for any noncompliance with this regulation which arises out of violations
alleged to have occurred during the period of the upset.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Upon the violation of any provision of this regulation, the Authority
shall serve written notice by actual delivery or certified mail upon the user.
Such written notice shall adequately state the nature of the violation and
provide at least ten (10) days for the correction of the violation, unless the
Authority finds a shorter period is required to protect the public health,
safety or welfare.
Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â Upon failure to correct the violation within the specified time limit,
the Authority may file in any court of competent jurisdiction an action for
injunctive relief, civil damages and/or penalties.
Â Â Â (k)Â Â Â The following civil penalties shall apply for the violation of the
following provisions of this regulation:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each day of violation after the
time limit specified by the Authority in its notice for each of the following

Â Â Â (l)Â Â Â In addition to the foregoing civil penalties, the Authority may
recover civil damages for any expense, loss or damage, including attorney's
fees, occasioned by a user's violation of this regulation.
Â Â Â (m)Â Â Â Recovery of Costs Incurred by the Authority. Any discharger violating
any of the provisions of this regulation, or who discharges or causes a
discharge producing a deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs
the Authority's wastewater disposal system shall be liable to the Authority for
any expense, loss, or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The
Authority shall bill the discharger for the costs incurred by the Authority for
any cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge.
Refusal to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this
regulation.
Â Â Â (n)Â Â Â Falsifying Information. A person who knowingly makes any false
statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, report,
plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this
regulation, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required under this regulation, shall upon
conviction be punished by the imposition of a civil penalty of not more than
$1,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 30 days, or by both.

Â 
Â 
1113.01 APPEALS.
Appeals concerning interpretation or administration of this Ordinance may be
taken by any owner of property or any other party with a substantial interest
in the matter who is adversely affected. Such appeal shall be taken within
thirty (30) days after the date of the decision, by filing with the Zoning
Inspector or with the Board of Zoning Appeals a notice of appeal specifying the
decision of the Zoning Inspector from which the appeal is being taken.
(Ord. 07-8. Passed 3-19-07.)
1113.02 POWERS OF THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
Â Â Â The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to authorize, upon appeal,
variances from the provisions or requirements of this Ordinance. Variances
shall be granted only when exceptional conditions exist. Exceptional conditions
would include irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots, or other exceptional
physical conditions of the land, where strict application of the provisions or
requirements of this Ordinance would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of
the land and buildings involved because of practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship. The Board shall not grant a variance from any provision of this
Ordinance unless it finds that the following facts and conditions exist:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions specific to the land or buildingÂ for
which the variance is sought, and such conditions do not apply generally to
land or buildings in the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â That such unreasonable and unnecessary hardship has not been created
by the appellant.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation in issue.
Â Â Â Under no circumstances shall the Board of Zoning Appeals grant an appeal or
variance that would allow a use not permissible under this Ordinance in the
district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the
terms of this Ordinance in said district.
(Ord. 07-8. Passed 3-19-07.)
1113.03 APPLICATION FOR VARIANCE AND APPEAL.
Â Â Â Any person owning or having an interest in property, after being denied a
zoning permit, may file an application to obtain a variance or appeal from the
decision of the Zoning Inspector. An application for a variance or appeal shall
be filed with the Zoning Inspector on a form as specified for that purpose. The
Zoning Inspector shall forward a copy of the application to the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
The application for a variance or an appeal shall contain the following
information:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Name, addresses, and phone number of the applicant.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Legal description of property as recorded in Perry County Recorderâ€™s
office.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â A map or drawing to approximate scale, showing the dimensions of the
lot and any existing or proposed building.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The names and addresses of all property owners within 200 feet,
contiguous to, and directly across the street from the property, as appearing
on the Perry County Auditorâ€™s current tax list.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Each application for a variance or appeal shall refer to the specific
provisions of this Ordinance which apply.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â A narrative statement explaining the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The use for which variance or appeal is sought.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Details of the variance or appeal that is applied for and the
ground on which it is claimed that the variance or appeal should be granted, as
the case may be.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The specific reasons why the variance or appeal is justified,
according to Section
1113.02 (a) to (e).
Â Â Â (Ord. 07-8. Passed 3-19-07.)
1113.04 PUBLIC HEARING BY THE BOARD.
Â Â Â Prior to making a decision on the proposed appeal or variance, the Board may
hold a public hearing for consideration of an appeal from a decision of the
Zoning Inspector or variance unless a resolution is passed. If such hearing is
held, notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers of
general circulation in the City at least ten (10) days before the date of said
hearing. The notice shall set forth the date, time and place of the public
hearing, and the nature of the proposed appeal or variance.

1113.05 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.

of the terms under which the appeal or variance is granted, shall be deemed a
violation of this Ordinance and shall be punishable under Section
1115.02.
(Ord. 07-8. Passed 3-19-07.)

Zoning Appeals following submittal of an application filed pursuant to Section
1113.03, the Board shall either approve, approve with supplementary conditions
or disapprove the request for appeal or variance. If the application is

of its decision and findings to the Zoning Inspector, who shall forward such
copy to the applicant by first class mail, or in person.

Â 
Â 
1117.01 INTENT.
Â Â Â Within the districts established by this Ordinance, there may exist lots,
structures, and/or uses of land or structures which were lawful before this
Ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or
restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or future amendments. It is the
intent of this Ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they
are removed, but not necessarily to encourage their survival. (Ord. 07-8.
Passed 3-19-07.)
1117.02 WHEN PERMITTED.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Existing Land or Buildings. Any use of land or buildings existing on
the effective date of this Ordinance may be continued, even though such use
does not conform to the provisions herein, so long as such use was lawful at
the time that the use or structure was established. No nonconforming building,
structure, or use shall be moved, extended, enlarged, reconstructed, or
structurally altered, except as specifically provided in this Ordinance.
Â 
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Construction Commenced. Any property purchased or acquired in good
faith for any nonconforming use prior to the adoption of this Ordinance, upon
which property the work of changing, remodeling or construction of such
nonconforming use has been legally commenced at the time of adoption of this
Ordinance, may be used for the nonconforming use for which such changing,
remodeling or construction was undertaken, provided that such work is completed
within two (2) years from the date of adoption of this Ordinance or amendment
thereto making said use nonconforming.
(Ord. 07-8. Passed 3-19-07.)
Â 
1117.03 SUBSTITUTION.
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall allow the nonconforming use of a building or
structure to be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or of a more
restricted classification, provided no structural alterations except those
required by law or ordinance are made.
A nonconforming mobile home, once removed, shall not be allowed to be relocated
on another lot, or replaced with another mobile home, without specific approval
of the Board of Zoning Appeals. (Ord. 07-8. Passed 3-19-07.)
1117.04 EXTENSION.
Â Â Â No nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, or
structurally altered, except as follows:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit, on a once-only basis, a
building containing a nonconforming use to be enlarged to an extent so the
resulting building shall be not more than one-hundred-seventy-five percent
(175%) of the ground floor area of the existing building or structure devoted
to a nonconforming use at the time of enactment of this Ordinance. The
Commission shall not authorize an enlargement, which would result in a
violation of the provisions of this Ordinance with respect to a yard or setback
affecting any adjoining premises.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole or in
part to any other location unless such building or structure and the yard and
other open spaces provided are made to conform to all of the regulations of the
district in which such building or structure is to be located.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Any residential structure that is nonconforming due to the fact of its
being in a non- residential zoning district may be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed or structurally altered, provided it meets the requirements of
the most proximate Residential District. (Ord. 07-8. Passed 3-19-07.)
1117.05 DISCONTINUANCE.
A nonconforming use, which has been discontinued or abandoned, shall not
thereafter be returned to a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall be
considered abandoned whenever any one of the following conditions exist:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â When the use has been voluntarily discontinued for a period of one (1)
year.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â When the nonconforming use has been replaced by a conforming use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (Ord. 07-8. Passed 3-19-07.)
1117.06 DAMAGE AND/OR DESTRUCTION OF A NONCONFORMING BUILDING OR USE.
Â Â Â When a building or structure, the use of which does not conform to the
provisions of this Ordinance, is damaged by fire, explosion, or an act of God
to the extent that less than sixty percent (60%) of its market value is lost,
it may be restored or rebuilt and continued in such nonconforming use, provided
that the restoration or rebuilding is commenced within one (1) year of the time
of damage that construction is completed within two (2) years, and that such
restoration or rebuilding would not extend or expand the existing use. If more
than sixty percent (60%) of the market value is lost, the building or structure
may not be restored or rebuilt in such a manner so as to continue the
nonconforming use.
Â Â Â In the administration of this section, if disagreement occurs as to the
market value of a particular property, that market value shall be determined by
an independent appraiser as selected and mutually agreed to by the applicant
and the City. Such appraisals shall be performed according to a comparable
value method of appraisal.
(Ord. 07-8. Passed 3-19-07.)
1117.07 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance and
repair of a building or structure containing a nonconforming use. Structural
alterations may be made to a building or structure containing a nonconforming
use as follows:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â When required by law.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â To convert to a conforming use.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â A building or structure containing residential nonconforming uses may
be so altered as to improve interior livability. However, no structural
alterations shall be made which exceed the area or height requirements or which
would extend into any yard required in the district in which such building is
located.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (Ord. 07-8. Passed 3-19-07.)
1117.08 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
Â Â Â In any district where dwellings are permitted, a one-family detached
dwelling may be erected on any lot of official record on the effective date of
this Ordinance, even though such lot does not comply with the lot area and
width requirements of the district in which it is located, provided said lot
has a minimum of forty (40) feet frontage on a public street; and further
provided the following conditions are complied with:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â In any district where dwellings are permitted, two (2) inches may be
deducted from the required minimum width of each side yard and four (4) inches
from the required sum of minimum widths of both side yards for each foot that
the lot is narrower than the required width for the district. In no case,
however, shall any side yard be narrower than three (3) feet.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â For lots having a depth of less than 100 feet, the depth of the rear
yard need not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the total depth of the lot,
but shall not be less fifteen than feet. (Ord. 07-8. Passed 3-19-07.)

Standard Zoning District Regulations
Â 
1123.01Â Â Â Regulation of the uses of land or structures.
1123.02Â Â Â Rules of application.
Â 
Â 
1123.01 REGULATION OF THE USES OF LAND OR STRUCTURES.
Â Â Â Regulations pertaining to the use of land and/or structures and the physical
development thereof within each of the zoning districts as established in
Section
1125.01, are hereby established and adopted. (Ord. 07-8. Passed 3-19-07.)
1123.02 RULES OF APPLICATION.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Identification of Uses. Listed uses are to be defined by their
customary name or identification, except as specifically defined or limited in
this Ordinance.
(b)Â Â Â Permitted Uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Only a use designated as permitted shall be allowed as a matter of
right in any zoning district, and any use not so designated shall be prohibited
unless:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A permitted use may be added to a zoning district by formal
amendment, in conformance with Chapter
1111.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â An unlisted use may be determined by the Board of Zoning Appeals
to be a similar use, pursuant to subsection (e) hereof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â No more than one (1) permitted use shall exist on any one zoned
lot.
(c)Â Â Â Accessory Uses. An accessory use or structure is a subordinate use or
structure clearly incidental and secondary to the principal permitted building
or use, and located on the same lot with such principal building or use.
Accessory uses or structures shall be allowed in accordance with the specific
district regulations, and the requirements of Chapter
1155.
(d)Â Â Â Conditional Uses. A use designated as a conditional use shall be allowed
in the zoning district where the designation occurs, when such use, its
location, extent and method of development will not substantially alter the
character of the vicinity, or unduly interfere with or adversely impact the use
of adjacent lots. To this end, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall, in addition
to the development standards for the specific district, set forth additional
requirements as will render the conditional use compatible with existing and
future use of adjacent lots in the vicinity, in accordance with Chapter
1107.
(e)Â Â Â Similar Uses. Determination as to whether a use is similar to uses
permitted by right shall be considered as an expansion of use regulations of
the district and not as a variance applying to a particular situation. Any use
found similar shall thereafter be considered as a permitted use in that
district.
Applications for zoning permits for uses not specifically listed in the
permitted building or use classifications of the zoning district, which the
applicant feels qualify as a similar use under the provisions of this Section,
shall be submitted to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
Within thirty (30) days after such submittal, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
determine whether the requested use is similar to those uses permitted in the
specific district. In order to find that a use is similar, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall find that all of the following conditions exist:
Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Such use is not listed as a permitted or conditional use in another
zoning district.
Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Such use conforms to basic characteristics of the district to which it
is to be added and is more appropriate to it than to any other district.
Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Such use creates no danger to health and safety, creates no offensive
noise, vibration, dust, heat, smoke, odor, glare, or other objectionable
influences, and does not create traffic congestion to an extent greater than
normally resulting from uses listed in the classification to which it is added.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Development Standards. Development standards set forth shall be the
minimum allowed for uses permitted in that district. If development standards
are in conflict with requirements of any other lawfully adopted rule,
regulation, or law, the most restrictive standard shall govern.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Development Plan. For particular uses in specific districts, a
Development Plan will be cited as required. In such cases, the applicant shall
submit the Development Plan at the time of the application for a zoning permit.
The Development Plan shall contain a site plan for the property, drawn to
approximate scale, showing all property lines and building outlines, access
drives, parking areas, and other notable physical features. The Development
Plan shall also show the size, design, materials and location of all signage
proposed for the development. The Development Plan shall contain a narrative
description of the proposed use, and how such use will impact adjacent
residential property.
Â Â Â The Development Plan shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission and must
be approved as a condition for the issuance of a zoning permit. In approving a
Development Plan, the Planning Commission shall find that the following
criteria have been met:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The proposed building or use shall have sufficient yard space to
provide for adequate parking and screening of adjacent residential areas in
accordance with this chapter (refer to Chapter
1157).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The Development Plan for the proposed facility has incorporated
measures to lessen and/or alleviate adverse impacts on adjacent residential
areas and to protect the residential character of such areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The location, design and operation of the proposed use shall not
impose undue adverse impacts on surrounding residential neighborhoods.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Essential Services. Essential Services, as defined and specified in
Chapter
1105, shall be permitted in any and all zoning districts within the City.

Â 
1175.01 SHORT TITLE.
Â Â Â This shall be known and may be cited as the "Subdivision Regulations for New
Lexington, Ohio" and shall hereinafter be referred to as â€œThese Regulations.â€
(Ord. 82-16. Passed 4-19-82.)
1175.02 INTERPRETATION AND PURPOSE.
Â Â Â In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these Regulations
shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the protection of the
public health, safety, and welfare. To protect the public among other purposes,
such provisions are intended to provide for permanently wholesome community
environment, adequate public services and safer streets and highways. (Ord. 82-
16. Passed 4-19-82.)
1175.03 SCOPE.
Â Â Â These regulations shall not apply to any lot or lots forming a part of a
subdivision created and recorded prior to the effective date of these
Regulations. Nor is it intended by these Regulations to repeal, abrogate, annul
or in any way impair or interfere with existing provisions of other laws, or
regulations, except those specifically repealed by these Regulations, or with
private restrictions placed upon property by deed, covenant or other private
agreement, or with restrictive covenants running with the land to which the
City is a party. Where these Regulations impose a greater restriction upon land
than is imposed or required by such existing provisions of law, resolution,
contract or deed, the provisions of these Regulations shall control.
(Ord. 82-16. Passed 4-19-82.)
1175.04 ADMINISTRATION AND AUTHORITY.
Â Â Â A Major Highway Plan having been adopted by the Planning Commission
according to statutory requirements, the City Council by virtue of the
provisions of Chapter 711 and Chapter 3787 of the Ohio Revised Code are
authorized, subject to the holding of required public hearings, to adopt rules
and regulations covering plats for subdivisions of land, and to approve,
conditionally approve, or disapprove plats or subdivisions of land falling
within their jurisdiction. Administration of the rules and regulations
contained herein shall be the responsibility of the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 82-16. Passed 4-19-82.)
1175.05 AREAS OF JURISDICTION.
Â Â Â The following provisions, as provided in Chapters
1177 through
1189 shall govern the subdividing of land within the incorporated areas of the
City and three (3) miles from the City limits. The provisions of Chapter
1185 shall apply to improvements to be constructed in any plat within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city administering subdivision
regulations.
(Ord. 82-16. Passed 4-19-82.)
1175.06 JURISDICTION.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Wherever Perry County has adopted a major street plan and subdivision
regulations and is exercising jurisdiction, the City Planning Commission will
confer with the County Planning Commission of said county upon all subdivision
plats located within three (3) miles of its corporate limit and the County
Planning Commission shall have the final approval of the plat and the
provisions in Chapter
1183  shall be the jurisdiction of the County Engineer.
Â 
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The design and layout of all subdivisions shall conform with the
requirements of Chapter
1181. The subdivider shall make improvements and shall submit preliminary and
final plans, all in accordance with Chapters
1179 and
1183.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The division of a tract into five parcels or less, fronting upon an
existing street, and where the transfer is to be accomplished by the recording
of a deed rather that a plat, requires the approval of the City Planning
Commission before it can be recorded. Such approval may be accomplished in the
manner provided in Chapters
1179 and
1181.
(Ord. 82-16. Passed 4-19-82.)
1175.07 PUBLIC HEARING.
Â Â Â The Commission, on its own initiative or upon petition by a citizen or
neighboring property owner may, prior to acting on a preliminary map of a
subdivision, hold a hearing therein at such time and upon such notice as the
Commission may designate.
(Ord. 82-16. Passed 4-19-82.)
1175.08 CONSTRUCTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Â Â Â These rules and regulations establish standards and specifications for the
construction of streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, sanitary sewers, sewage
disposal plants, storm sewers, and other facilities. (Ord. 82-16. Passed 4-19-
82.)
1175.09 EFFECTIVE DATE.
Â Â Â These Regulations shall be effective following adoption by the City Council
and the City Planning Commission of New Lexington, Ohio, after public hearing.
Henceforth, any other regulations previously adopted by the City Council or the
City Planning Commission shall be deemed to be repealed. These Regulations
shall in no way affect any subdivision having received preliminary approval
prior to the effective date provided, however, that no changes to the
preliminary plan as approved, are introduced by the subdivider.
(Ord. 82-16. Passed 4-19-82.)
1175.10 AMENDMENTS.
Â Â Â The City Planning Commission may, after public hearing, amend, supplement or
change these Regulations. Notice shall be given of the time and place of such
public hearing by publication in at least one (1) newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of New Lexington, Ohio thirty (30) days prior
to holding of said hearing. The amendment or amendments shall be on file in the
Municipal Building for public examination during the said thirty (30) days.

1179.01 PREAPPLICATION PROCEDURE.
Â Â Â Previous to the filing for tentative approval of the preliminary plat the
subdivider shall submit to the City Planning Commission a sketch plan.
Â Â Â The purpose of this stage is to discuss early and informally the purpose and
effect of these regulations and to familiarize the developer with the
Comprehensive Plan, official highway plan for New Lexington, Ohio zoning and
other city and county planning engineering projects, drainage, sewerage, water
systems and similar standards, requirements and plans.
Â Â Â The sketch plan shall be clearly and legibly drawn by mechanical means or
freehand. The size of the map shall be on one (1) or more sheets and shall be
drawn at a scale of one (1) inch equals one hundred (100) feet.

Â Â Â 
1179.02 FILING PRELIMINARY PLAT.
Â Â Â Before any subdivider, or his agent, contracts for the sale of, or offers to
sell, any subdivision of land or any part thereof which is under the
jurisdiction of the City of New Lexington, the subdivider or his agent shall
file a preliminary plat of said subdivision with the Planning Commission.
Â Â Â Five copies of a preliminary plat, drawn in accordance with the regulations
herein prescribed, shall be submitted to the Planning Commission. No
preliminary plat shall be entitled to consideration or approval at any meeting
of the Planning Commission unless it is filed with the Secretary of Perry
County not less than 14 days prior to such meeting.
(Ord. 82-16. Passed 4-19-82.)
1179.03 APPLICATION OF PRELIMINARY PLAT; FILING AND DISTRIBUTION.
Â Â Â An Application, in writing, for the tentative approval of the preliminary
plat, together with four (4) blueprints, shall be filed with the Planning
Commission at least two (2) weeks before the meeting of the Planning Commission
at which the plat is to be acted upon. The preliminary plat shall be prepared
in accordance with the regulations set forth below, and shall be submitted to
Perry County prior to the completion of final surveys of roads and lots and
before the start of any grading or construction work upon the proposed roads or
streets and before any map of said subdivision is made in a form suitable for
recording. The Planning Commission shall determine whether a tentative map is
in proper form and shall not receive and consider such a map as filed until it
is submitted in accordance with the requirements hereof. Perry County shall
distribute a copy of the preliminary plat to each of the following officials:
the City Engineer (2), the Administrative Director and the Zoning Inspector.
Where the preliminary plat covers only a part of the subdivider's entire
holding, a sketch of the prospective future system of the unsubmitted part
shall be considered in the light of adjustments and connections with the road
system of the part not submitted. (Ord. 82-16. Passed 4-19-82.)
1179.04 SEWERAGE DISPOSAL AND WATER SUPPLY.
Â Â Â The subdivider shall connect to the City's Sanitary Sewer System and Water
System and comply with all requirements for the construction and cost
associated with the connection.

outside the Corporation Limits, the following provisions shall apply: The
subdivider in a letter accompanying the request for preliminary approval of an
allotment shall state the kind and type of sewage disposal treatment he
proposes to use. If other than a sewage treatment plant, it shall be
accompanied by a letter from the County Board of Health stating what type of
sewage disposa1 they approve for the soil conditions encountered in the area of
the proposed subdivision.
Â Â Â If a housing development or a shopping center, commercial or industrial is
proposed to be built, a central sewage treatment plant and a central water
system must be constructed by the developer when deemed necessary by the
Planning Commission and County Commissioners, County Health Director and County
Sanitary Engineer concurring.

1323.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of New Lexington, State of Ohio, does ordain
as follows:
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Findings of Fact. The City of New Lexington has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Protect human life and health;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of New
Lexington as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by the City of New Lexington.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Flood Insurance Study Perry County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Perry County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both
effective April 18, 2011.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of New Lexington as required by Section
1323.04 (c).
Â Â Â Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at 215 South Main Street, New Lexington, Ohio, 43764.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances including
subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict
between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall
be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant
or easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by
the regulations.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Considered as minimum requirements;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of New Lexington, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 11-07.
Passed 3-7-11.)
1323.02 DEFINITIONS.
Â Â Â Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Accessory Structure: A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Appeal: A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Base Flood: The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE): The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Basement: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Development: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor:  See "Lowest Floor."
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
Â Â Â (k)Â Â Â Flood or Flooding:  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
Â Â Â (l)Â Â Â Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
Â Â Â (m)Â Â Â Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
Â Â Â (n)Â Â Â Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
Â Â Â (o)Â Â Â Flood Insurance Study (FIS):  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
Â Â Â (p)Â Â Â Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
Â Â Â (q)Â Â Â Floodway:Â Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
Â Â Â (r)Â Â Â Freeboard:  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
Â Â Â (s)Â Â Â Historic structure: Any structure that is:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
Â Â Â (t)Â Â Â Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
Â Â Â (u)Â Â Â Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
Â Â Â (v)Â Â Â Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
Â Â Â (w)Â Â Â Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Â Â Â (x)Â Â Â Manufactured home park:  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
Â Â Â (y)Â Â Â National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
Â Â Â (z)Â Â Â New construction: Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of New Lexingtonâ€™s
Flood Insurance Rate Map, September 2, 1982, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
Â Â Â (aa)Â Â Â Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C. 111.15
as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited to,
any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical

Â Â Â (ff)Â Â Â Special Flood Hazard Area:  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
Â Â Â (gg)Â Â Â Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or

addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
Â Â Â (kk)Â Â Â Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
Â Â Â (ll)Â Â Â Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

the City of Louisville, and may be submitted at any time.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of New Lexington have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of New Lexingtonâ€™s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Louisville boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of New Lexington suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the City of New Lexington has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
Â Â Â (k)Â Â Â Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1323.05 .
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
Â Â Â (l)Â Â Â Substantial Damage Determinations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Development in Floodways.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1323.03 (j)(1);
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Concurrence of the Administrator of The City of Louisville and
the Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Subsection (i)(1)B. items 1. and 3.-5.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with The
City of Louisville specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1323.03 (j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Ord. 11-07. Passed 3-7-11.)
1323.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Appeals Board Established.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The Council of the City of New Lexington shall appoint an Appeals
Board consisting of the Zoning Board of Appeals. The members shall serve 5 year
terms after which time they shall be reappointed or replaced by the Council of
the City of New Lexington. Each member shall serve until his/her successor is
appointed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
Municipal Building, 215 South Main St., New Lexington, Ohio 43764.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Powers and Duties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Appeals.Â Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Application for a Variance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â J.Â Â Â The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â K.Â Â Â The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Variances shall only be issued upon:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A showing of good and sufficient cause.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Â Â Â Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Other Conditions for Variances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(2)A. to K. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Procedure at Hearings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All testimony shall be given under oath.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Stark County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

1331.01 DEFINITIONS; NUISANCE ABATEMENT GENERALLY.
Â Â Â For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â â€œPublic nuisanceâ€ means any garage, shed, barn, house, building or
structure which by reason of the condition in which it is permitted to remain,
shall or may endanger the health, life, limb or property of any person, or
cause any hurt, harm, damage, injury, or loss to any person in any one or more
of the following ways, means or particulars:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â By reason of being dilapidated, decayed, unsafe or unsanitary; is
detrimental to health, morals, safety, welfare and the well being of the City;
endangers life or property or is conducive to ill health, delinquency and
crime;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â By reason of fire hazard; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â By reason of the conditions which require its continued vacancy,
the public nuisance, and its surrounding grounds, are not reasonably or
adequately maintained thereby causing deterioration and creating a blighting
influence or condition on nearby properties and thereby depreciating the value,
use and enjoyment of such properties to such an extent that it is harmful to
the public health, welfare, morals, safety and economic stability of the area,
community or neighborhood in which such public nuisance is located.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â â€œTotal costâ€ means any costs incurred due to the use of employees,
materials or equipment of the City, any costs arising out of contracts for
inspection, labor, materials or equipment, and costs of service of notice or
publication required under this section. The City may collect the total cost of
removing, repairing, or securing insecure, unsafe, structurally defective,
abandoned, deserted, or open and vacant buildings or other structures.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â â€œOwnerâ€ means the owner or owners of record as shown on the tax
records of the Perry County Auditorâ€™s Office and also includes any purchaser or
purchasers buying under a land contract whether recorded or unrecorded in the
records of Perry County.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Procedure for Finding of Public Nuisance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Whenever the Mayor or City Administrator suspects the existence of
a public nuisance as defined by subsection (a) hereof, or is advised by the
Fire Department, Fire Inspection Officer, or learns from any other source of
the apparent existence of such nuisance, (s)he shall promptly cause such
suspected public nuisance to be inspected by the Fire and/or Health Inspection
Officer. The Fire or Health Inspector may request the assistance of other City
departments in the performance of the inspection, or may contract a person or
firm to perform inspection of situations where the Fire or Health Inspector
lack the expertise, (i.e., structural integrity, etc.). Following such
inspection, should the Inspection Officer determine that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that a public nuisance exists, he shall notify the Chairman
of the Board of Nuisance Abatement and provide the Chairman a report of these
inspections and findings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Upon receipt of this report, the Chairman of the Board of Nuisance
Abatement shall cause a meeting to be held by the Board on the question of the
probable existence of a public nuisance. If at least two members of the Board
agree that a public nuisance (as defined in subsection (a) hereof) does exist,
the Chairman shall cause a written order to be served on the owner of the
subject property, in accordance with subsection (e) hereof, stating the
findings of the Board with respect to the existence of a public nuisance. The
order shall include: where abatement of the nuisance can be accomplished
through repair or rehabilitation, a list of repair or rehabilitation
specifications required to abate the public nuisance; and shall state that
unless the owner of the subject property causes the abatement of the public
nuisance by repair, rehabilitation or demolition, the same will be abated by
the City at the expense of the owner. Such abatement by the owner shall start
within thirty days after receipt of the order and shall be completed within
ninety days or, where abatement is to be accomplished through repair or
rehabilitation, such additional time as the Chairman of the Board or duly
authorized representative may deem necessary to complete the abatement of the
public nuisance.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Notice of Hearing. The notice of hearing required under subsection (d)
(2) hereof shall be served by mailing a copy to the owner, as defined in
subsection (c), by United States certified mail with return receipt requested,
by personally serving such owner or by leaving a copy at the usual place of
residence of such owner. If service of the notice provided for in subsection
(d) hereof is not perfected by any of the hereinbefore described methods, then
the Board of Nuisance Abatement shall cause such motion to be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City once each week for two consecutive
weeks prior to the date of the hearing. However, such published order shall not
include a list of the repair or rehabilitation specifications mentioned in
subsection (d)(2) hereof.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Appeal Procedure.Â Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The owner may, within ten days after service of the order of the
findings of the Board of Nuisance Abatement as provided for in subsection (d)
hereof, that the subject property does constitute a public nuisance, make a
demand in writing to the Board for an appeal on the question of whether in fact
a public nuisance as defined in subsection (a) hereof does exist.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The owner of the property in question, or his duly authorized
representative or agent, shall be notified of the date, time and place of the
appeal hearing in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) hereof, and
shall be given an opportunity of appearing in person or through a duly
authorized representative or agent, at such hearing and of presenting such

Chapter may be subject to a criminal proceeding instituted by the attorney of
the City of New Lexington. It is unnecessary to prove the defendant's state of
mind with regard to offenses that constitute such violations, as the

under this Chapter may avoid the same upon presenting sufficient evidence to
establish that the alleged violation has been remedied. At the discretion of
the attorney for the City of New Lexington and if sufficient evidence is
presented prior to trial, a nolle prosequi may be entered for the charge with
or without prejudice.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â In lieu of initially pursuing a criminal action, the Code
Enforcement Officer may issue a penalty up to $100.00 per rental unit to the
violator. If the penalty is paid in the amount and in the manner required by
the violation notice and the violation is corrected as required by the
violation notice, further court action shall not be pursued for the violation.
Â Â Â If the penalty is not paid within thirty (30) days from the assessment
thereof, the Code Enforcement Officer may file a criminal action against the
violator. In the alternative, the Code Enforcement Officer may treat the unpaid
penalty as a lien upon the Residential rental property owned by the violator.
The lien shall not be limited to the Rental unit owned by the violator but
shall be effective as to the entire Residential rental property, if applicable.
The Code Enforcement Officer shall certify to the County Auditor any unpaid
penalty. The County Auditor shall then place such unpaid penalty upon the real
property tax duplicate of the Residential rental property owned by the
violator. Such unpaid penalty shall be a lien upon such Residential rental
property from the date the unpaid penalty is placed upon the real property tax
duplicate of the Residential rental property. Failure to pay any unpaid penalty
which is certified to the County Auditor shall result in foreclosure of the
property by the County Prosecutor. This remedy shall be in addition to all
other collection remedies provided by law including an action in Small Claims
Court.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Civil Enforcement.  Any person violating the provisions of this
Chapter may be subject to a civil proceeding instituted by the City of New
Lexington Attorney. The City Attorney may apply for injunctive relief against
the person, to prevent, abate, or enjoin any continuing violation of the
provisions of this Chapter. The violator shall be responsible for any costs
incurred in preventing, abating, or enjoining such violations. The City
Attorney shall provide the violator a breakdown of costs and require payment
within thirty (30) days.
Â Â Â Any costs incurred and unpaid within thirty (30) days from the date of the
letter of the City Attorney shall be a lien upon the Residential rental
property owned by the violator. The lien shall not be limited to the Rental
unit owned by the violator but shall be effective as to the entire Residential
rental property, if applicable. The Code Enforcement Officer shall certify to
the County Auditor any unpaid costs. The County Auditor shall then place such
unpaid costs upon the real property tax duplicate of the Residential rental
property owned by the violator. Such unpaid costs shall be a lien upon such
Residential rental property from the date the unpaid cost is placed upon the
real property tax duplicate of the Residential rental property. Failure to pay
any unpaid cost which is certified to the County Auditor shall result in
foreclosure of the property by the County Prosecutor. This remedy shall be in
addition to all other collection remedies provided by law including an action
in Small Claims Court.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Administrative Enforcement. Any person violating the provisions of
this Chapter may be subject to administrative proceedings instituted by the
Code Official or Code Enforcement Officer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Notice of violation. The Code Enforcement Officer is authorized to
serve a notice or order on the property owner, Perry County authorized agent,
landlord, or any other person responsible for the occupancy of the rental unit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Show cause hearing. If such violations are not remedied within the
time specified, the Code Enforcement Officer shall schedule a show cause
hearing and provide the person an opportunity to defend his, her, or its
conduct at the hearing prior to any penalty being imposed. After such show
cause hearing, the Code Enforcement Officer shall render a written decision
within twenty (20) days, informing the person of his or her decision and
detailing the reasons for any adverse action taken against the person. The show
cause decision shall be delivered pursuant to the method of service provisions
of this Chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Administrative penalties. Notwithstanding any other section of this
Chapter, any person who is found to have violated any provision of this Chapter
or directive of the Code Enforcement Officer shall be assessed an
administrative penalty as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â The total amount of the penalty shall be $100.00 multiplied by the total
number of rental units involved in the violation with the maximum penalty being
$1,000. The penalty shall be subject to a 5% daily interest until such penalty
is paid.
Â Â Â Any penalty assessed and unpaid within thirty (30) days from the written
decision of the Code Enforcement Officer shall be a lien upon the Residential
rental property owned by the violator. The lien shall not be limited to the
Rental unit owned by the violator but shall be effective as to the entire
Residential rental property, if applicable. The Code Enforcement Officer shall
certify to the County Auditor any unpaid penalty. The County Auditor shall then
place such unpaid penalty upon the real property tax duplicate of the
Residential rental property owned by the violator. Such unpaid penalty shall be
a lien upon such Residential rental property from the date the unpaid penalty
is placed upon the real property tax duplicate of the Residential rental
property. Failure to pay any unpaid penalty which is certified to the County
Auditor shall result in foreclosure of the property by the County Prosecutor.
This remedy shall be in addition to all other collection remedies provided by
law including an action in Small Claims Court.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Administrative appeals.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any person aggrieved by any administrative enforcement action
taken pursuant to this Chapter, or any person who in good faith claims that the
true intent of this Chapter or the rules legally adopted thereunder have been
incorrectly interpreted, or that the provisions of this Chapter do not fully
apply, shall have the right to an appeal to the Property Maintenance Appeals
Board. The Property Maintenance Appeals Board shall not have the authority to
waive any requirement of this Chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â All appeals shall be filed with the City Administrator within
twenty (20) days of the date the written decision is issued by the Court. A
public hearing will then be afforded to the appellant within forty-five (45)
days of the filing of the appeal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â An appeal under this section shall automatically stay the Code
Enforcement Officer's actions in all cases other than those where the violation
alleges substantial issues of habitability.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Appeals shall be heard based solely upon the available
information to the official or body rendering the initial decision. Appeals
shall not be used to consider new or additional information. Information
submitted but not discussed in rendering a decision shall be considered part of
the original record and may be considered on appeal. Testimony may be given
based upon the material submitted to the decision-maker.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The Appeals Board shall make findings of fact and shall render a
decision in writing based upon the record created at the public hearing within
twenty (20) days.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The Appeals Board may affirm, modify, reverse, vacate, or revoke
the action appealed, provided that such action shall be affirmed by the Appeals
Board if the action taken was not arbitrary or capricious or was taken pursuant
to law.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The fee for the filing of an appeal under this Section shall be
$100.00.

Dear Rental Property Owner:
Pursuant to the Codified Ordinances of City of New Lexington Chapter 1343, a
landlord shall register all residential properties within the City of New
Lexington.
A "landlord" is defined as the owner, lessor or sub-lessor of a rental unit or

management of a rental unit, including any person who is authorized to receive
any rent or any part of the rent, other than as a bona fide purchaser, and who
has no obligation to deliver any portion of that rent to another. It also shall
mean any person held out by the owner or the landlord as the appropriate person
to accept performance or any person with whom the tenant normally deals as a
landlord.
Any material change in the registration information, including but not limited
