   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06   CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1) If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
101.07   DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
101.08   SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99   GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

107.01   INTRODUCTION.
   It is the policy of the Village of Perry, Lake County, Ohio (the "Village")
that openness leads to a better informed citizenry, which leads to better
government and better public policy. It is the policy of the Village to
strictly adhere to the State of Ohio's Public Records Act. All exemptions to
openness are to be construed in their narrowest sense and any denial of public
records in response to a valid request must be accompanied by an explanation,
including legal authority as outlined in the Ohio Revised Code. If the request
is in writing, the explanation must also be in writing.
(Res. 2012-11. Passed 9-13-12.)
107.02   PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   The Village, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, defines records
as including the following: any document-paper, electronic (including, but not
limited to, e-mail) or other format that is created or received by, or comes
under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents the organization,
functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of
the office. All records of the Village are public unless they are specifically
exempt from disclosure under the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)   Further, it is the policy of the Village that, as required by Ohio
law, records will be organized and maintained so that they are readily
available for inspection and copying (See Section
107.05 for the e-mail record policy). Record retention schedules are to be
updated regularly and posted prominently.
(Res. 2012-11. Passed 9-13-12.)
107.03   RECORD REQUESTS.
   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines:
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must contact
the requester for clarification, and should assist the requestor in revising
the request by informing the requester of the manner in which the office keeps
its records.
   (b)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. It is the Village's general policy that this
information is not to be requested.
   (c)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be
made available within a reasonable period of time. "Prompt" and "reasonable"
take into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the
location where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review
of the records requested.
   (d)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine request include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, etc., if fewer than 20
pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily available in an
electronic format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should be
made as quickly as the equipment allows.
      (1)   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
      (2)   An estimated costs if copies are requested.
      (3)   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
   (e)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority.
(Res. 2012-11. Passed 9-13-12.)
107.04   COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost of making
copies.
   (a)   The charge for paper copies is five cents per page.
   (b)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is $1.00
per disc.
   (c)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
   (d)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
(Res. 2012-11. Passed 9-13-12.)
107.05   E-MAIL.
   Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office. E-mail
is to be treated in the same fashion as records on other formats and should
follow the same retention schedules.
   (a)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business are
subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of the Village are
instructed to retain their e-mails that related to public business (see Section
1 Public Records) and to copy them to their business e-mail account and/or to
the office's records custodian.
   (b)   The records custodian is to treat e-mails from private accounts as
records of the Village, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining them per
established schedules and making them available for inspection and copying in
accordance with the Public Records Act.
(Res. 2012-11. Passed 9-13-12.)
107.06   FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
   The Village recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of failure to
properly respond to a public records request. In addition to the distrust in
government that failure to comply may cause, the Village's failure to comply
with a request may result in a court ordering the Village to comply with the
law and to pay the requester attorney's fees and damages.
(Res. 2012-11. Passed 9-13-12.)
107.07   COST OF COPIES REQUESTED.
   The Village shall charge for the coping of such records requests a "General
Copy Fee" as well as a "Mailing Fee," if necessary; and said charges shall be
determined and established annually by Village Council.
(Res. 2012-11. Passed 9-13-12.)

   As of this 13th day of September, the aforesaid charges are as follows:
      *General Copy Fee: $0.05 Per Page/Per Side

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
      Chap.
171.   Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and Criminal
Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged with an
offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is such
that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before him
and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

181.02   DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
ORC, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the ORC and the use is not consistent, then the use of the
term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall
control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC.
   (B)   The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall include
the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   (C)   As used in this chapter:
      (1)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file

taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
         (a)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal

intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
         (b)   Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (C)(1)(a) of this section, but excluding that portion
of intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of property described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (c)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or

Revenue Code;
         (d)   (i)   Except as provided in (C)(1)(d)(ii) of this section,

an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
            (ii)   Division (C)(1)(d)(i) of this section does not apply to the
extent the income or gain is income or gain described in Section 1245 or 1250
of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (e)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;
         (f)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.

or accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless
such payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as

employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer,

paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.

telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745. of the ORC.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
         (a)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever

taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
181.04 (C);
         (c)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Village to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same
period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)   If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of
the Village may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
            (i)   Separate accounting;
            (ii)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the

            (iv)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
181.12 (A).
         (c)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
181.12 (A).
         (d)   Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (iii)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described

customer, client, or patient.
         (b)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
         (a)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in the Village if,
regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the following
criteria:
         (i)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village from
a stock of goods located within the Village.
         (ii)   The property is delivered within the Village from a location
outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
         (iii)   The property is shipped from a place within the Village to
purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the taxpayer is
not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or
promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
         (b)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.
         (c)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the Village.
         (d)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village.
         (e)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Village's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Village or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the Village.
The Village shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for
the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Village, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
Village to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real
estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)   An individual who is a resident of the Village shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the Village. The individual may claim a credit for taxes
the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under the Village's income tax ordinance.
      (7)   When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

181.04   COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
Withholding provisions.
   (A)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the Village shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the Village. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
181.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
181.01(B)(1) of this chapter, of two percent (2%). An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Village the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Village in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the Village in any month of the preceding calendar
quarter exceeded $200.
Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the
last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
         (c)   Intentionally left blank.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Village as the return
required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Village during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

         (a)   "Employer" includes a person that is a related member to or of
an employer.
         (b)   "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in

or controlled by an employer.
         (c)   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

section, an employer is not required to withhold the Village income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the Village if the employee performed such services in the Village on 20 or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Village.
            (ii)   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Village. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
Village at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
               (a)   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
            (iii)   The employee is a resident of the Village and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
181.04.
            (iv)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)   For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Village than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            (i)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            (iv)   Transporting or delivering property described in division

employer;
            (v)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to the Village for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the Village.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
Village for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to
the employee for personal services performed in the Village.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the Village and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
181.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the Village.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
181.04.

      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
181.05 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income

      (2)    Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for the Village income
tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which

corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and, with
respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to support
the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files
the annual return required by this section electronically is not required to
provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the

      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Village to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of

automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Village's income tax
return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the

the filing of the Village's income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month

return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments other than as provided in
this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)   To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village shall not

      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village for a taxable
year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the Village an
annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section.
   (I)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
181.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the Village by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section

remitted to the Village and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the Village to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize

income tax return, report, or document required by the Village, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the
Village or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
chapter and of the Village's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.

   (M)   (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the

amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.

duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the Village
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by the Village during the period of the member's
or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.

division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order

United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)   For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing

Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.

Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated the Village income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a
consolidated the Village income tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated the Village income tax return for all subsequent taxable years,
unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.

the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
181.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
181.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
181.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
181.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
181.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated the Village income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
181.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated the Village income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the Village in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (Y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 10-2015. Passed 10-8-15.)
181.06   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Village who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due the Village under this chapter.
   (B)   The Village shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Village who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants
a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (C)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)   Intentionally left blank.

For the purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld for the Village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Village in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve

authorized agent, The Regional Income Tax Agency (RITA), including the
application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before the
applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month
after the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent
of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth (6th) month
after the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;

   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
181.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;

      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment

presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Village under Section
181.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

(Ord. 10-2015. Passed 10-8-15.)
181.09   REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section

   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:

   (C)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
181.21.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return upon which the tax
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
181.18 (A)(4).

been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Village as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village is subject to recovery by the Village. If
the Village's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a

shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the Village
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (C)   If the Village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Village's tax rate. However, if the Village's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to the Village, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 10-2015. Passed 10-8-15.)
181.11   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the Village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
Village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)   to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)   if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
181.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of Section
181.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Village. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
181.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to the
Village income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Village income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).

181.12   LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
181.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth (16th) day after the date on
which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth (16th) day after the date on which the final determination of the
Board of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or
ultimately reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole
or in part, or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
181.09.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
181.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
181.09.
   (E)   No civil action to recover the Village income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 10-2015. Passed 10-8-15.)
181.13   AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 10-2015. Passed 10-8-15.)
181.14   SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other Village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 10-2015. Passed 10-8-15.)
181.15   ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village that arises pursuant to the Village's income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 10-2015. Passed 10-8-15.)
181.16   TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the Village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 10-2015. Passed 10-8-15.)
181.17   FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Village ordinance or state law
to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Village or the Tax Administrator.

      (5)   "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation, schedule,
and other document required to be filed with the Tax Administrator or the
Village by a taxpayer, employer, any agent of the employer, or any other payer
pursuant to applicable law, including at any time before January 1, 2016.

      (8)   "Unpaid withholding tax" means withholding tax due but not paid by

      (9)   "Withholding tax" includes amounts an employer, any agent of an

   (B)   (1)   This section applies to the following:
         (a)   Any return required to be filed under applicable law for taxable
years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         (b)   Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to the Village on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the Village to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (C)   Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer
for any reason fail, in whole or in part, to make timely and full payment or
remittance of income tax, estimated income tax, or withholding tax or to file
timely with the Village any return required to be filed, the following

181.19   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the ORC:
      (1)   (a)   Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as provided
by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.

the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the Village's
Income Tax Ordinance;
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)   Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and

respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)   Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including

      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal

      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the Village or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
181.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
181.99.
         (b)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
181.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
181.18.
         (c)   The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
181.99 for a violation of Section
181.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It

Administrator in accordance with the Rules and Regulations.
   (C)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (D)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.

with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.

the Village at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor
of the Village. This member may be an employee of the Village, but may not be

the Mayor.
      (3)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
      (4)   A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.

defined in R.C. §4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left

When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief

private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle

oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not

      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.

person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (a)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as

(d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Sheriff or Chief of Police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger

keeping, or restrict him or her in the method of storing or keeping, any
collector’s vehicle on private property with the permission of the person
having the right to the possession of the property, except that the
municipality may require a person having such permission to conceal, by means
of buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any
unlicensed collector’s vehicle stored in the open.
      (3)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal corporation,
a state highway patrol trooper, the Legislative Authority, or the zoning
authority may send notice, by certified mail with return receipt requested, to
the person having the right to the possession of the property on which a junk
motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk
motor vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other
suitable structure, or shall be removed from the property.
      (4)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in
the open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this

of willful failure to comply with the notice, and each subsequent period of 30
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.

vehicle:
         A.   Using an electronic wireless communications device, as defined in
R.C. § 4511.204, in violation of that section.
            1.   The device’s speakerphone function;
            2.   A wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short

ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section

      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,

         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.

and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and

violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
         If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the
violation and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars
($100.00), the court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the
additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender
instead may elect to attend the distracted driving safety course described in
subsection (b)(1) of this section. If the offender elects the course option and
attends and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued
written evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The
offender shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for
the violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the officer shall do
both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the

313.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC

from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.

turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.

(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a

test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician,
chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical test
or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and (d)(4)C. of this section,
“National Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or (d)(4)B.2. of this section and if the testimony or
evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the
testimony or evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the
trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   Laboratory report.
      (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a

designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   Limitation of liability.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or R.C. § 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or R.C. § 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician- paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
(R.C. § 4511.19(A) - (F))
         (g)   Implied consent.
      (1)   Definitions. For the purpose of this division (g), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device.” Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control.” Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   Tests at request of law enforcement agent. The chemical test or
tests under division (g)(2) of this section shall be administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the
person was operating or in physical control of a vehicle in violation of a
division, section or ordinance identified in division (g)(2) of this section.
The law enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate
which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to R.C. §§
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if convicted would
be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)
(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
“You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state law
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
“If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I. or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state O.V.I., and,
if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) “If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
“If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) of this section or division (g)(6) of this section to submit to a
chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, the arresting
officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to the court in
which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is
not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest,
and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or
permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon
receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
      (9)   Duties of officer.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. §
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first-class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest, provided
the report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is
sworn to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48
hours after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy
of the sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on
the charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197
relative to any suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from the
arrest covered by the report.
(R.C. § 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person’s
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person’s being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B),
or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control of a
vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or R.C. § 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) or
R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the charge resulting from
the arrest shall be held within five days of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance granted by
the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the issues specified in that
section.
(R.C. § 4511.191(D))
   (h)   Penalty for driving under the influence.
      (1)   Whoever violates any provisions of divisions (a)(1)A. through (a)
(1)I. or (a)(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever
violates division (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle
while under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for
either offense under R.C. Chapter 2929, except as otherwise authorized or
required by divisions (h)(1)A. through (h)(1)E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (h)(1)B., (h)(1)C., (h)
(1)D. or (h)(1)E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the first degree and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the
penalties and sanctions provided in R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(a)(i) to (G)(1)(a)
(iv).
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in division (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of division (a) of this
section, or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the penalties and
sanctions provided in R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) to (G)(1)(b)(v).
         C.   Except as otherwise provided in division (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of division (a) of this
section or other equivalent offenses is guilty of a misdemeanor. The court
shall sentence the offender to all of the penalties and sanctions provided in
R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c)(i) to (G)(1)(c)(vi).
         D.   Except as otherwise provided in division (h)(1)E. of this

law.
         E.   An offender who previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) that was a felony, regardless of
when the violation and the conviction or guilty plea occurred, is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver’s or occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or R.C. § 4511.19 as a result of the
conviction or guilty plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in R.C. §
4511.191(F)(2).
      (3)   A.   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under R.C. §
4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) or (G)(1)(b)(ii) or (G)(1)(c)(i) or (G)(1)(c)(ii) and if,
within 60 days of sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the term, the offender will not be able
to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing, the court may impose an alternative sentence as specified in R.C. §
4511.19(G)(3) that includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring,
with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by R.C.
§ 4511.19(G)(1), the court may sentence the offender as provided in R.C. §
4511.19(G)(3).
      (4)   If an offender’s driver’s or occupational driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended under division (h) of
this section or R.C. § 4511.19(G) and if R.C. § 4510.13 permits the court to
grant limited driving privileges, the court may grant the limited driving
privileges in accordance with that section. If division (A)(7) of that section
requires the court impose as a condition of the privileges that the offender
must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under R.C. § 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in R.C. § 4503.231(B).
      (5)   Fines imposed under this section for a violation of division (a) of
this section shall be distributed as provided in R.C. § 4511.19(G)(5).

assigned or transferred and R.C. § 4503.234(B)(2) or (B)(3) applies, in
addition to or independent of any other penalty established by law, the court
may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of
the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so

privilege form the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(6). The court may grant
limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under R.C. §§ 4510.021
and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition
interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s Indigent Drivers’ Alcohol
Treatment Fund.
   (k)   Appeal; effect on suspension. If a person whose driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended
under this section or R.C. § 4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of
the person’s trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay the operation
of the suspension.

section does not apply to a person who operates a vehicle while the person has
a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a

division (a)(1)J. of this section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of
R.C. § 2923.16(D) in the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for
a prohibited concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   Applicability of terms. All terms defined in R.C. § 4510.01 apply to
this section. If the meaning of a term defined in R.C. § 4510.01 conflicts with
the meaning of the same term as defined in R.C. § 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term
as defined in R.C. § 4510.01 applies to this section.

court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (o)(3)A. of this section.

license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver's or commercial driver's
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of

prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender's driver's or commercial driver's license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender's restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender's license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender's driver's license, commercial driver's
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under

   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of

conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated

be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

339.01   OVERSIZE OR OVERWEIGHT VEHICLE OPERATION ON STATE ROUTES; STATE
PERMIT.
   (a)   State regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with R.C. §§ 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under R.C. § 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed a
nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(R.C. § 4513.34)
   (b)   Violations. Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of
a minor misdemeanor.

339.01.
   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or for such
period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his discretion

Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of operation for such vehicle
or combination of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed or such other
restrictions as may be necessary for the preservation of the public peace,
property, health and safety. The Police Chief may require the posting of bond
or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway or road
structure.
   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge ten dollars ($10.00),
and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by each police officer in
supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay the sum of
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per hour per officer. The charge can be prorated
into fifteen minute increments.
   Signs shall be posted to apprise drivers of the limitations imposed by this
section. Such signs shall be in accordance with the standards for traffic
control devices of the State Department of Transportation. No driver shall
disobey the instructions indicated on any such sign.
   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the permit
granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit, and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalty prescribed by
subsection (c) hereof.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second offense within one year after the first offense, the
person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on each subsequent
offense within one year after the first offense, the person is guilty of a

      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this

conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person's entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
       (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts
to commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

Municipality for purposes of this section.

      (2)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
         A.   “Offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant.” The phrase includes but is not limited to a violation of R.C.
§ 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43(A)
or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense involving
misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any municipal
ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code sections listed
in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is

      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in

the period of limitation does not begin to run until the course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred

took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03

      (2)   The amendment to division (a)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. §2903.01 or R.C. §2903.02 if the

applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.

   (m)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the

501.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   "Intoxication" includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
(ORC 2901.21)
501.08   CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person's specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender's specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person's conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person's conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person's
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09   ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor's effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor's criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under

      "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of

complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.

501.99   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. §2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (a) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. §2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (a) and
R.C. §2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this division
(a), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may
be imposed pursuant to this division (a) include, but are not limited to, the
following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (a) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (a)(1)B.1. and
(a)(1)B.2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by
law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. §2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including but not limited to the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including but not limited to a per diem fee for room and
board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of repairing
property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (a)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (a) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under R.C. §2929.27 in lieu of
imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court does not determine
that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term of community service
under R.C. §2929.27 in lieu of or in addition to imposing a financial sanction
under this division (a) and in addition to imposing court costs. The court may
order community service for a minor misdemeanor pursuant to R.C. §2929.27 in
lieu of or in addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and
in addition to imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial
sanction or court costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the
financial sanction or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (a)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under this division (a),
or R.C. §§ 2929.26 or 2929.27, or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under R.C. §2929.26 to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s General Fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the Fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (a) of this section, R.C. §§ 2929.26, 2929.27, or in operating a
facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under R.C.
§2929.26.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (a)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (a) of
this section, R.C. §§ 2929.26, 2929.27, or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under R.C. §2929.26 to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the Fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (a) of this section, R.C. §§ 2929.26 or 2929.27, or in operating a
facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under R.C.
§2929.26.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (a)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (a) of this section or R.C. §§
2929.26 or 2929.27 to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (a), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C.
§111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (a)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (a)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (a)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (a)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (a)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (a)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (a)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (a)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state or political subdivision may
do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. §1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (a)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (a) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (a), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C.
§301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (a) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
      (10)   If an offender is sentenced to pay restitution, a fine, fee, or
incarceration costs, the clerk of the sentencing court, on request, shall make
the offender’s payment history available to the victim, victim’s
representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, the prosecutor, the probation
department, and the court without cost.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in R.C. §2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5)
of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to
law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court's
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender's jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender's term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender's participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. §2941.1421 regarding one or more of
those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120 days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. §2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241
or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and any
residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or R.C. §2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or R.C. §2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. §2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. §2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor Maximum Fine
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section 501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to
this subsection (c).

519.07   DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition of Illicit Discharges. No person shall discharge, or cause
to be discharged, an illicit discharge into the MS4. The commencement, conduct,
or continuance of any illicit discharge to the MS4 is prohibited except as
described below:
      (1)   Water line flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows;
rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration; uncontaminated
pumped ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains;
air conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; and discharges or flows from fire fighting activities. These
discharges are exempt until such time as they are determined by the Village to
be significant contributors of pollutants to the MS4.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the Village as being necessary
to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Discharges from off-lot discharging home sewage treatment systems
permitted by the Lake County Board of Health for the purpose of discharging

other applicable Lake County Board of Health regulations, until such time as
the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency issues an NPDES permitting mechanism
for Household Sewage Treatment Systems existing prior to January 1, 2007. These
discharges are exempt unless such discharges are deemed to be creating a public
health nuisance by the Lake County Board of Health.
In compliance with the Perry Village Storm Water Management Program, discharges
from all off-lot discharging home sewage treatment systems must either be
eliminated or have coverage under an appropriate NPDES permit issued and
approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. When such permit coverage
is available, discharges from off-lot discharging home sewage treatment systems

eliminate illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4. This program
shall include the mapping of the MS4, including MS4 outfalls and home sewage
treatment systems; the routine inspection of storm water outfalls to the MS4,
and the systematic investigation of potential residential, commercial,
industrial, and institutional facilities for the sources of any dry weather
flows found as the result of these inspections.

operator to install monitoring equipment as necessary. This sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in safe and proper
operating condition by the facility owner/operator at the owner/operator's
expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be
calibrated by the Village to ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and reasonable
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed
by the facility's owner/operator at the written or oral request of the Village
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by
the facility owner/operator.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Village access to a facility
subject to this regulation for the purposes of illicit discharge inspection is
a violation of this regulation.
      (6)   If the Village is refused access to any part of the facility from
which storm water is discharged, and the Village demonstrates probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this regulation, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of an inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this regulation or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, the Village
may seek issuance of a search warrant, civil remedies including but not limited
to injunctive relief, and/or criminal remedies from any court of appropriate
jurisdiction.
      (7)   Any costs associated with these inspections shall be assessed to
the facility owner/operator.
(Ord. 2010-04. Passed 3-11-10.)
519.09   ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Notice of Violation. When the Village finds that a person has violated
a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this regulation, the Village

required, the Notice of Violation shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said Notice shall further advise
that, should the facility owner/operator fail to remediate or restore within
the established deadline, a legal action for enforcement may be initiated.
   (c)   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation must meet compliance
standards within the time established in the Notice of Violation.
   (d)   Administrative Hearing: If the violation has not been corrected
pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Notice of Violation, the Village
shall schedule a hearing before the Village Board of Zoning Appeals to
determine reasons for non-compliance and to determine the next enforcement
activity. Notice of the administrative hearing shall be hand delivered and/or
sent registered mail.
   (e)   Injunctive Relief: It shall be unlawful for any owner/operator to
violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this
regulation pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3709.211. If a owner/operator has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this regulation, the Village may
petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the owner/
operator from activities that would create further violations or compelling the
owner/operator to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.

(Ord. 06-2005. Passed 5-26-05.)
523.09   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization).
   The controls shall include the following minimum components:
   (a)   Non-structural Preservation Measures: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
   Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
         Table 1: Permanent Stabilization
         Area requiring permanent stabilization   Time frame to apply erosion
controls
         Any area that will lie dormant for one year or more.   Within 7 days
of the most recent disturbance.
         Any area within 50 feet of a stream and at final grade.   Within 2
days of reaching final grade.
         Any area at final grade.   Within 7 days of reaching final grade
within that area.
         Table 2: Temporary Stabilization
         Area requiring temporary stabilization   Time frame to apply erosion
controls
         Any disturbed area within 50 feet of a stream and not at final
grade.   Within 2 days of the most recent disturbance if that area will remain
idle for more than 21 days.
         For all construction activities, any disturbed area, including soil
stockpiles that will be dormant for more than 21 days but less than one year,
and not within 50 feet of a stream.   Within 7 days of the most recent
disturbance within the area.
         Disturbed areas that will be idle over winter.   Prior to November 1.
   Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion matting.
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than 14 days. Such practices may include, among others: sediment settling
ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or
channels which direct runoff to a sediment settling pond. All sediment control
practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered
functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a
sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. Concentrated storm water runoff and runoff
from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of silt fence or inlet
protection, as determined in Table 3 below, shall pass through a sediment
settling pond or equivalent best management practice upon approval from the
Village Engineer and/or the Lake SWCD.
   The sediment-settling pond shall be sized to provide at least 67 cubic yards
of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. When determining the
total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas which remain
undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless runoff from these
areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is not co- mingled
with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the sediment-settling pond must be
less than or equal to five (5) feet. The configuration between the inlets and
the outlet of the basin must provide at least two units of length for each one
unit of width (> 2:1 length: width ratio). Sediment must be removed from the
sediment-settling pond when the design capacity has been reduced by 40 percent.
This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin
depth. When designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider
public safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the
sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment
and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is
encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, water resources, and wetlands from sediment transported via sheet
flow. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on
a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The
relationship between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular
slope range is shown in Table 3 below. Storm water diversion practices shall be
used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices,
which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas
up to 10 acres.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 ≥ 2% but < 20%
0.125                                ≥ 20% but < 50%
 
      (4)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. Straw or hay bales are not acceptable
forms of inlet protection.
      (5)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete or
cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and
constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent edition of
the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Streets directly adjacent to construction entrances and receiving
traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned daily to remove sediment
tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on these streets nearest to
the construction entrances shall also be cleaned weekly.
Based on site conditions, Village Engineer and/or the Lake SWCD may require
additional best management practices to control off site tracking and dust.
These additional BMPs may include:
         C.   Silt fence or construction fence installed around the perimeter
of the development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to
designated construction entrances.
         D.   Designated wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these areas must
be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling pond, or to a
sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
523.09 (G) of this regulation.
         E.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The Village Engineer and/or the Lake SWCD
may require dust controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed
areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and
regulation of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (6)   Stream protection. Construction vehicles shall avoid water
resources and wetlands. If the applicant is permitted to disturb areas within
50 feet of a water resource or wetland, the following conditions shall be
addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources or wetlands from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resource
or wetland.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
      (7)   Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (e)   Non-sediment Pollutant Controls: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources or wetlands.
These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Waste Materials: A covered Dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
      (3)   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of all
containers in the storage area.
      (4)   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.
      (5)   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
   (f)   Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (g)   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (h)   Internal Inspections. All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The applicant shall
assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these inspections to ensure
that the control practices are functional and to evaluate whether the SWP3 is
adequate, or whether additional control measures are required. Qualified
inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and experience in the
installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion controls.
These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the Village or an alternate form
acceptable to the Village Engineer.
      (3)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
      (4)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (5)   The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non- compliance determined by these inspections.
   (i)   Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When practices require repair or maintenance. If an internal
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds
must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When practices fail to provide their intended function. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its
intended function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate
control practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control
practice must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (3)   When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection
reveals that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must
contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not
needed.
   (j)   Final Stabilization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
Village Engineer.

545.02   DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05, 545.06, or 545.08, 545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or 545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
is committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections 545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender's same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05, 545.06 or 545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or 545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of Section
545.05 or 545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active
duty service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

555.01   PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable storm water management standards to achieve a level
of storm water quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Village of Perry.
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the Village of Perry, Lake County, Ohio to:
      (1)   Control storm water runoff from their property and ensure that all
Stormwater Control Measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the Village's future
expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
555.01.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Lake County, and the
Village shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects initiated after
March 10, 2006, and, to the maximum extent practicable, for projects initiated
before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the Village Engineer. Such projects must be designed to minimize
the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance.

(Ord. 2016-29. Passed 11-10-16.)
555.09   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General: The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources.
The SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological, and chemical integrity
of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site.
Acceptable practices shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project and complies with the community's
riparian setback requirements if applicable.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing storm water peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         E.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by the Village and Ohio EPA.
SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional criteria
required by the Village Engineer, shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use: SCMs shall be designed to achieve
the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be compatible with
the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Chapter 555 [community subdivision code], shall
provide stormwater management and water quality controls for the development of
all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for lot grading and drainage
that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm; and
maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development runoff patterns,
volumes, and peaks from each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources: SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
555.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter 555,
all as determined by the Village Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels: All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
555.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the storm water
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing SCMs, or if
the storm water management requirements for the site are provided by practices
defined in a regional or local storm water management plan approved by the
Village Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance: All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the Village Engineer
as detailed in Section
555.08.
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the Village, SCMs serving
multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and maintained by
an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the property owners, by the
Village. SCMs serving single lots shall be placed on these lots, protected
within an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage: Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and
grubbing practices; and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and
through these areas. Post-construction storm water practices shall provide
perpetual management of runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving
stream's physical, chemical and biological characteristics are protected and
ecological functions are maintained.
      (10)   Preservation of Wetland Hydrology: Concentrated storm water runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters the wetlands in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope. Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology. If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands,
a hydrological analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed
discharge matches the predevelopment hydroperiods and hydrodynamics that
support the wetland.
      (11)   Soil Preservation and Post-Construction Soil Restoration: To the
maximum extent practicable leave native soil undisturbed and protect from
compaction during construction. Except for areas that will be covered by
impervious surface or have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil moisture-
holding capacity of areas that have been cleared and graded must be restored to
that of the original, undisturbed soil to the maximum extent practicable. Areas
that have been compacted or had the topsoil or duff layer removed should be
amended using the following steps: 1. till subsoil to a depth of 15-18 inches,
2. incorporate compost through top 12 inches, 3. Replace with stockpiled site
or imported suitable topsoil to a minimum depth of 4 inches.
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection: The Village Engineer may allow
modification to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only
if the applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from
the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and
local agencies as required in Section
555.07 of this regulation and the activity is in compliance with Chapter 555,
all as determined by the Village Engineer. At a minimum, stream relocation
designs must show how the project will minimize changes to the vertical
stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat of upstream and
downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges: Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the storm water quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that off-
site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a
manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow: The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as
determined by the Village Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels: Unless otherwise allowed by the Village Engineer,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with vegetated
banks and designed to carry the 10-year, 24-hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under Village zoning or where the use of an open drainage system
affects public health or safety, all as determined by the Village Engineer. The
following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5-year, 24-hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10-year, 24-hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributing drainage area within the
proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream
from the development.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the Village Engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tail water of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tail water elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the Village:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25-year, 24-hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or
conveyance must to be sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10-
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tail water of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100-year,
24-hour storm, or the 1 00-year flood elevation as determined by FEMA,
whichever is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey storm water runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the Village must be
compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First consideration for
the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be given to areas
where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new floodplain
within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also be given to
enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for floodplain
fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing watershed. Unless
otherwise permitted by the Village, reductions in volume due to floodplain
fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the development.
Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must reasonably conform to
the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The use of vertical
retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control:
      (1)   Direct runoff to an SCM: The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more of the following SCMs. These practices are listed in
Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general
performance standards:
         A.   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         B.   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote settling,
filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured stormwater
into the ground. The Village Engineer may require a soil engineering report to
be prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed infiltration
facilities meet these performance standards.
For sites less than five (5) acres, but required to create a comprehensive
stormwater management plan, the Village Engineer may approve other SCMs if the
applicant demonstrates to the [community engineer's] satisfaction that these
SCMs meet the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
555.09(c)(6).
         C.   For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, the Village Engineer may approve other SCMs if
the applicant demonstrates to the [community engineer's] satisfaction that
these SCMs meet the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
555.09(c), and has prior written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         D.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the State, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the Village Engineer may approve SCMs not included in Table 2 of
this regulation, but must show compliance with the current version of the Ohio
Department of Transportation "Location and Design Manual, Volume Two Drainage
Design".
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs. SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the Village
Engineer that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed SCMs controlling the
amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-term hourly
records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
               WQv = C*P* A/12
            where terms have the following meanings:
               WQv =water quality volume in acre-feet
               C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1 in.
               P= 0.75 inch precipitation depth
               A = area draining into the stormwater practice, in acres.
            Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency (Ohio EPA) for use in determining the WQv can be determined using the
list in Table 1 or using the following equation to calculate the runoff
coefficient:
               C=0.858i 3 - 0. 78i 2 + 0. 774i+0.04, where:
               i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the stormwater treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is
High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1 )(0.2) = (0.35)
 
         B.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the storm water practice for sediment storage. This volume
shall be incorporated into the sections of stormwater practices where
pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   Each individual SCM must be sized to treat the WQv associated
with its entire contributing drainage area. Exceptions to this may be granted
by the Village Engineer and/or the OEPA on a case-by-case basis.
         D.   Stormwater quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment arid protect against
downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.
         E.   Sites within watersheds of coldwater habitat streams shall
include SCMs to infiltrate the water quality volume or reduce the temperature
of discharged runoff. SCMs that reduce the temperature of discharged runoff
include bioretention, permeable pavement, underground detention, and
incorporation of shading and infiltration in parking lot design.
         F.   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection Plan and Maintenance Agreement for the site.

1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours
to provide storage for subsequent storm events.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended detention
basins. Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv.
3 Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQv.
4 Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within 24 hours so that
there is no standing water. Shorter drawdown times are acceptable as long as
design criteria in Rainwater and Land Development have been met.
6 This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale.
o 7 Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv
in a pool and 75% in marshes. The Edv above the permanent pool must be equal
to the WQv.
 
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.   Infiltration facilities should be designed to meet all criteria
in Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site. No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than 1/3rd of the drain time. The
outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism, maintenance, and
promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ratio of 4:1 or flatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4 feet
shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8 feet and no
more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The 8 feet wide portion
of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an average depth of 6
inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation.
The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below the
permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who accidentally or
intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense vegetation in a
manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through the vegetation.
The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). The aquatic
bench shall be planted with native plant species comparable to wetland
vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged inundation. The use of invasive
plant species is prohibited.
            3.   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets. The forebay and micropool volume shall
be equal to at least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
            4.   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary outlet
becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to facilitate maintenance.
The emergency drain should be designed to drain by gravity where possible.
      (5)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction SCMs:
The applicant may request approval from the Village Engineer for the use of
alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the applicant shows to the
satisfaction of the Village Engineer that these SCMs are equivalent in
pollutant removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those
listed in Table 2. If the site is greater than five (5) acres, or less than
five (5) acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which
will disturb five (5) or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA is
necessary. To demonstrate the equivalency, the applicant must show:
         A.   The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State. The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultraurban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a (TMDL) has identified water quality problems in the
receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under predevelopment conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method, or other
hydrologic method approved by the Village Engineer, the total volume (acre-
feet) of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development
drainage area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the
following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Model pervious, directly connected impervious and disconnected
impervious areas as separate subwatersheds.
            4.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            5.   Rainfall Depth- For the most accurate, up-to-date, location
specific rainfall data for stormwater design, use the Precipitation-Frequency
Atlas of the United States, NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3). [available online: http://
hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.]
            6.   Temporal Distribution- Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than 1
year. Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition.
            7.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land use.
               i.   Pre-development Curve Numbers -For wooded or brushy areas,
use listed values from TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
1986 in good hydrologic condition. For meadows, use listed values. For all
other areas (including all types of agriculture), use pasture, grassland, or
range in good hydrologic condition.
               ii.   Post-development Curve Numbers - Open space areas shall
use post-construction HSGs from Rainwater and Land Development unless the soil
is amended after development according to the following protocol: till the
subsoil to 15-18 inches, then till using a chisel, spader, or rotary tillage
and incorporate compost through top 12 inches, replace topsoil to a minimum
depth of 4 inches. All undisturbed areas or open space with amended soils shall
be treated as "open space in good condition."
            8.   Time of Concentration - Use velocity based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
               i.   Maximum sheet flow length is 100 ft.
               ii.   Use the appropriate "unpaved" velocity equation for
shallow concentrated flow from Soil Conservation Service National Engineer
Handbook Section 4- Hydrology (NEH-4).
            9.   The volume reduction provided by permeable pavement,
bioretention, or other LID SCMs may be subtracted from the post development
stormwater volume. Volume reductions for these practices may be demonstrated
using methods outlined in Rainwater and Land Development or a hydrologic model
acceptable to the Village Engineer.
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description except in instances of engineered permeable pavement systems. From
the volume determined in Section
555.09(d)(3)A., determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table
3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff
is:                                               The Critical Storm will be:
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff
is:                                               The Critical Storm will be:
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:
---                       10                      1 year
10                        20                      2 year
20                        50                      5 year
50                        100                     10 year
100                       250                     25 year
250                       500                     50 year
500                       ---                     100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
   (e)   Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects.
      (1)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment
projects shall reduce existing site impervious areas by at least 20 percent. A
one-for-one credit towards the 20 percent net reduction of impervious area can
be obtained through the use of green roofs. Where site conditions prevent the
reduction of impervious area, SCMs shall be implemented to treat at least 20
percent of the WQv- Alternate to 555.09(e)(1): Comprehensive Stormwater
Management Plans for redevelopment projects must accomplish one of the
following options:
         A.   Reduce existing site impervious areas by at least 25 percent, a
one-for-one credit towards the 25 percent net reduction of impervious area can
be obtained through the use green roofs.
         B.   Infiltrate at least 25 percent of the WQv.
         C.   Capture, treat and release 50 percent of the WQv.
When a combination of impervious area reduction and storm water quality control
facilities are used, ensure a 20 percent net reduction of the site impervious
area, provide for treatment of at least 20 percent of the WQv, or a combination
of the two. Where projects are a combination of new development and
redevelopment, the total water quality volume required to be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at
100 percent water quality volume and redevelopment at 20 percent.
      (2)   Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section
555.10 may be approved by the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 2016-29. Passed 11-10-16.)
555.10   ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the Village of Perry determines that site constraints compromise

way within the corporation limits as such rights of way are a valuable and
limited resource which must be utilized to promote the public health, safety,
and welfare including the economic development of the Municipality.
      (2)   Changes in the public utilities and communication industries have
increased the demand and need for access to rights of way and placement of
facilities and structures therein.
      (3)   It is necessary to comprehensively plan and manage access to, and
structures and facilities in, the rights of way to promote efficiency,
discourage uneconomic duplication of facilities, lessen the public
inconvenience of uncoordinated work in the rights of way, and promote the
public health, safety, and welfare.
      (4)   The Municipality has authority under the Laws and Constitution of
the State of Ohio, including but not limited to Article 18, Sections 3, 4 and

their uses are not singled out in this chapter. The Municipality recognizes the

restrictive way for the occupant, providing the Municipality’s primary goal of
maintaining and managing the right of way is not negatively impacted.

responsible for the administration of
Chapter 997, except as otherwise provided herein. The Mayor may delegate any or
all of the duties hereunder to a designee.
   (b)   Rights of Way Occupancy. Each person who occupies, uses or seeks to
occupy or use the rights of way to operate a system located in the rights of
way, or who has, or seeks to have, a system located in any rights of way, shall
apply for and obtain a certificate of registration pursuant to
Chapter 997. Any person owning, operating or maintaining a system in the rights
of way without a certificate of registration, including persons operating under
a permit, license or franchise issued by the Municipality prior to the
effective date of
Chapter 997 shall apply for and obtain a certificate of registration from the

997.02(d). Application will consist of providing the information set forth in
Section
997.03 and as reasonably required by the Mayor.
   (c)   No Construction Without a Certificate of Registration. Following the
effective date of
Chapter 997, no person shall construct or perform any work on or in, or use any

obtaining a Certificate of Registration. Whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree as provided for in Section
997.99.
   (d)   Exceptions.
      (1)   The following entities are not obligated to obtain a certificate of
registration: the Municipality and resellers of services or persons that do not
own any system or facilities in the rights of way.
      (2)   The following entities are required to participate in the

obligations of the application fee required by Section
997.03(a) and the registration maintenance fee required by Section
997.05(A): Cable operators for the purpose of providing only cable service and
operating pursuant to a valid cable franchise, and video service provider for

requirements of, and/or specifically exempted by, a valid current and valid
cable franchise with the Municipality.
      (3)   If a public utility, as defined by Ohio R.C. 4905.02, or a public
utility company, as defined by Ohio R.C. 4905.03, previously has been granted a
certificate of registration under Section 997.03 of the Village of Perry
Codified Ordinances, then such public utility shall be exempt from the
requirement of Section 997.03 to apply for and/or obtain a renewal of the
certificate of registration unless such public utility intends to use or occupy

requirements set forth in Section 997.03 and Section 997.04 of the Village of
Perry Codified Ordinances.
      (4)   Other exceptions permitted by Ohio R.C. Chapter 4939.
   (e)   Systems in Place Without a Certificate of Registration. Any system or
part of a system found in a rights of way for which a certificate of
registration has not been obtained shall be deemed to be a nuisance and an
unauthorized use of the rights of way. The Municipality may exercise any
remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to
abating the nuisance; taking possession of the facilities and/or non-complying
portion of such system; and/or prosecuting the violator.
   (f)   Future Uses. In allowing providers and permittees to place facilities
in the rights of way, the Municipality shall not be liable for any damages
caused thereby to any provider's facilities that are already in place or that
shall be placed in the rights of way unless those damages arise out of the sole
negligence, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud of the Municipality.
No provider is entitled to rely on the provisions of this Chapter as creating a
special duty to any provider.
   (g)   Discontinuance of Operations, Abandoned and Unused Facilities.
      (1)   A provider who has discontinued or is discontinuing its operations
of any system in the Municipality shall:
         A.   Provide information satisfactory to the Municipality that the
provider's obligations for its system in the rights of way under this section
and any other sections in the Code have been lawfully assumed by another
applicant and/or provider; or
         B.   Submit a written proposal to re-use its facilities in a manner
that promotes the Municipality's goals of providing innovative and economic
solutions to efficiently and economically utilize limited rights of way
capacity. Such proposal must be approved by the Municipality Engineer; or
         C.   Submit a written proposal for abandonment of facilities in place
indicating why good engineering practice would support this type of solution.
The Municipal Engineer must approve said proposal; or
         D.   Completely remove all specifically identified portion(s) of its
system in a manner acceptable to the Municipality within a reasonable amount of
time if the Municipality believes that there exists a reasonable justification
for such removal; or
         E.   Submit to the Municipality within a reasonable amount of time and
in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21, a proposal for transferring
ownership of its facilities to the Municipality. If a provider proceeds under
this clause, the Municipality may, at its option where lawful:
            1.   Purchase the facilities; or
            2.   Unless a valid removal bond has already been posted pursuant
to Section
997.17(B), require the provider to post a bond in an amount sufficient to
reimburse the Municipality for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in
removing the facilities.
      (2)   Facilities of a provider who fail to comply with this section and
which remain unused facilities shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned
facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The Municipality may exercise any
remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to:
         A.   Abating the nuisance;
         B.   Taking possession of the facilities and restoring them to a
useable condition subject to a finding of the PUCO pursuant to the requirements
of Ohio R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21; or
         C.   Requiring removal of the facilities by the provider or by the
provider's surety.
      (3)   If the Municipality requires a provider to remove unused facilities
in any rights of way, the Municipality shall use reasonable efforts to direct
that this removal occur in conjunction with other scheduled excavations of the
rights of way. If the Municipality abates the nuisance it may take all action
necessary to recover its costs and to abate said nuisance, including but not
limited to, those methods set forth in Ohio R.C. 715.261.
   (h)   Nature of Issuance. A certificate of registration shall not convey
equitable or legal title in the rights of way. A certificate of registration is
only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy rights of way in the
Municipality, for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the
certificate of registration and in accordance with
Chapter 997 of this Code. The rights to occupy the right of way may not be
subdivided or subleased; provided, however, that two or more providers may
collocate facilities in the same area of the rights of way so long as each such
provider complies with the provisions of
Chapter 997. Collocating providers may file a joint application for a
construction permit. A certificate of registration does not excuse a provider
from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before co-
locating its facilities on facilities of others, including the Municipality's
facilities. A certificate of registration does not prevent a provider from
leasing space in or on the provider's system, so long as the sharing of
facilities does not cause a violation of law, including the provisions of
Chapter 997. A certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from
complying with any provisions of the Code or other applicable law.
   (i)   Other Approvals, Permits, and Agreements. In addition to a certificate
of registration, providers shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals,
permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for the offering or provision of
such services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities and
upon the Municipality's reasonable request, shall provide copies of such
documents to the Municipality. Further, a certificate of registration issued
pursuant to
Chapter 997 shall not entitle a provider to use, alter, convert to, or
interfere with, the facilities, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines,
wires, fiber, cable or any other real or personal property of any kind
whatsoever under the management or control of the Municipality.
   (j)   Rules and Regulations. The Municipal Engineer may propose, and Council
may adopt (and from time to time amend) the rules and regulations regarding
Chapter 997, construction standards and occupancy requirements of the right of
way. Such rules and regulations shall not materially increase the obligation of
any provider hereunder, provided however that none of the following shall in
any way be considered a material increase in obligation; the adoption of rules
and regulations increasing fees; the requiring of the placement of facilities
in designated portions of the rights of way (underground or otherwise); the
overbuilding of facilities; or the requiring of joint-builds. Prior to the
adoption or amendment of the rules and regulations, the Municipality shall
provide written notice and a copy of the proposed language of such adoption or
amendment, via United States regular mail, to each provider who holds a then
current certificate of registration. Each provider shall then have thirty days
following the date of the Municipality's mailing to provide written comment
regarding the proposed language to the Municipality. At least forty-five days,
but not more than sixty days following the date of the Municipality's mailing,
the Municipality shall schedule and hold a meeting, to make available a forum
at which all then current providers may address any questions, concerns and
make reasonable suggestions regarding the proposed new rules and regulations to
the Municipality. The Municipal Engineer shall, following said meeting and the
review of the providers' comments and suggestions, adopt or amend the rules and
regulations in a manner that best serves the Municipality, for approval by
Municipal Council
(Ord. 2019-06. Passed 6-13-19; Ord. 2019-11. Passed 9-26-19.)

construction and arboricultural practice (if applicable), including any
appropriate state building codes, safety codes and law and use best efforts to
repair and replace any street, curb or other portion of the rights of way, or
facilities located therein, to a condition to be determined by the Municipal
Engineer to be adequate under current standards and not less than materially
equivalent to its condition prior to such work and to do so in a manner which
minimizes any inconvenience to the public, the Municipality and other
providers, all in accordance with all applicable provisions of this chapter,
any rules and regulations the Municipality may adopt and the Code; and
      (5)   Construct, install, operate and maintain its facilities and system
in a manner consistent with all applicable laws, ordinances, construction

emergency tree removal or the use of vegetation management programs within the
rights of way that is performed without the Mayor or designee's written
permission shall subject a person to the penalties of Section
997.99 and may further require that the tree or vegetation be replaced, at the
sole expense of the responsible person, with a healthy tree or vegetation of
like kind and quality; and

Municipality may take whatever action is necessary to remove the graffiti and
bill the provider for the cost thereof; and
      (10)   Providers shall use all reasonable efforts to field identify their
facilities in the rights of way whenever providers are notified by the
Municipality that the Municipality has determined that such identification is
reasonably necessary in order for the Municipality to begin planning for the
construction, paving, maintenance, repairing, relocating or in any way altering
any street or area in the rights of way as defined in this Chapter. The
Municipality shall notify the providers of the Municipality's date to begin the
process at least thirty days prior to the commencement of said activities. In
field identifying facilities:
         A.   Providers shall identify all facilities that are within the
affected rights of way using customary industry standards and distinct
identification; and
         B.   Facilities will be so marked as to identify the provider
responsible for said facilities; and
         C.   Should any such marking interfere with the facilities function,
create a safety problem or violate any safety code, alternative methods of
marking the facilities may be approved by the Engineer; and
         D.   All marking should be clearly readable from the ground and
include provider's name, logo and identification numbering or tracking
information. No advertising will be permitted.
      (11)   A provider that is replacing an existing utility pole shall be
responsible to coordinate with all other providers to ensure the orderly
transfer of all lines or cables to the replacement utility pole, the removal of
the existing utility pole, and the restoration of the rights of way within
thirty days weather permitting after the replacement utility pole is installed.

   (f)   Establishment of Utility Corridors.
      (1)   Council may assign specific corridors within the rights of way, or
any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities
that are, or may someday be, located within the rights of way.
      (2)   Any provider whose facilities are in the rights of way and are in a
position at variance with utility corridors established by the Municipality
Council shall at the time of the next construction of the area, excluding
normal maintenance activities, move such facilities to their assigned position
within the rights of way. Existing underground facilities located within a
designated utility corridor shall not be required to relocate into adjacent or
alternative portions of the rights of way unless they are in conflict with an
actual or proposed public improvement project. The above requirements may be
waived by the Mayor for good cause shown including, but not limited to,
consideration of such factors as: the remaining economic life of the
facilities, public safety, customer service needs, law precluding such
undergrounding of facilities, and hardship to the provider. If a provider is
denied a requested waiver from the above requirements, the provider may appeal
the denial of the Mayor to Council.
      (3)   The Municipality shall make every good faith attempt to accommodate
all existing and potential users of the rights of way as set forth in this
chapter.
      (4)   Providers may enter into written agreements to use existing poles
and conduits with the owners of same and shall use best efforts to install
their facilities within the rights of way.
      (5)   No facility placed in any rights of way shall be placed in such a
manner that interferes with normal travel on such rights of way.
      (6)   Unless otherwise stated in a certificate of registration, permit,
or Section
997.03(f)(6)C. all facilities within the rights of way shall be constructed and
located in accordance with the Code and with the following provisions:
         A.   Whenever all existing facilities that have been traditionally
located overhead are located underground in a certain area within the
Municipality, a provider who desires to place its facilities in the same area
must also locate its facilities underground.
         B.   Whenever a provider is required to locate or re-locate facilities
underground within a certain area of the Municipality, every provider with
facilities within the same area of the Municipality shall concurrently re-
locate their facilities underground.
         C.   The above requirements may be waived by the Municipality for good
cause shown including, but not limited to, consideration of such factors as:
the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer service
needs, Law precluding such undergrounding of the facilities, and hardship to
the provider. If a provider is denied a requested waiver from the above
requirements, the provider may appeal the denial of the Municipal Engineer to
the Mayor.
(Ord. 2019-06. Passed 6-13-19.)
997.04   REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Construction and Major Maintenance Plan. Each provider shall, when
requested by the Municipality, file a construction and major maintenance plan
with the Mayor. Such construction and major maintenance plan shall be provided
for specific geographical areas requested by the Municipality, up to and
including the entire geographical area of the Municipality. It shall be
submitted using a format(s) mutually agreeable to the provider and the
Municipality and shall contain the information determined by the Municipality
to be necessary to facilitate the coordination and reduction in the frequency
of construction in the rights of way. The construction and major maintenance
plan shall include, but not be limited to, all currently scheduled and/or
anticipated construction projects for the next calendar year, if none are
scheduled or anticipated then the plan shall so state. The provider shall use
its best efforts in supplying this information and shall update the
construction and major maintenance plan on file with the Municipality whenever
there is a material change in scheduled and/or anticipated construction
projects. In an effort to assist providers with the completion of their annual
construction and major maintenance plan, the Municipality, as soon as possible,
will send each provider's system representative a descriptive narrative (and
any mapping information reasonably available) for all the planned right of way
improvements and/or scheduled maintenance that the Municipality then currently
intends to undertake during the calendar year.
   (b)   Mapping Data. With the filing of its application for a certificate of
registration, a provider shall be required to accurately inform the
Municipality of the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right
of way the provider's system then currently occupies. With the filing of its
application for a certificate of registration, a provider may voluntarily
provide such mapping data to demonstrate accurately the general location of its
system within the public right of way. The Municipality reserves the right to
create its own public way inventory map and may recover the cost of creation
through the registration process.
   (c)   Exemption from Disclosure. A provider shall notify the Municipality if
the provider believes that any specific document or portion of a document being
submitted to the Municipality is exempt from the public records disclosure
requirements of Ohio R.C. 149.43. The notification shall be in writing and
indicate the specific document or portion of a document that the provider
believes is exempt from disclosure. The notification shall include the legal
basis for the claimed exemption, including the applicable statutory reference
and any additional information necessary to make a determination of exemption
for each specific document or portion of a document. If a public records
request is made for documents submitted by a provider, the Municipality will
consider the written notification in making its own independent determination
of whether a specific document or a portion of a document is exempt from the
disclosure requirements of Ohio R.C. 149.43. To the extent permitted by law,
the Municipality will endeavor to use reasonable best efforts to notify the
provider of the request prior to making the document available for inspection
or copying.
(Ord. 2019-06. Passed 6-13-19.)
997.05   PUBLIC WAY FEES.
   (a)   Compensation. The Village may levy a public way fee under Ohio R.C.
4939.05 based upon the amount of actual costs incurred by the Village that were
directly caused by construction activity performed by a provider or other
person who conducts construction activity within the public way and which the
Village was not able to recover by way of any other recovery mechanism.
   (b)   Calculation of Annual Public Way Fee. Each year, the Village shall
calculate the amount of the actual and incurred costs caused by public way
construction activity in the prior year that the Village was not able to
recover through other recovery mechanisms. To the extent that such costs were
caused by a provider or other person who performed construction activity within
the public right-of-way, the Village shall issue an invoice to such provider or
person for a public way fee in the amount of the actual costs that were
directly caused by such provider or person's construction activity and not able
to recover through other recovery mechanisms.
   (c)   Limitations on Public Way Fee. Public way fees shall not include any
costs which merely benefit users and occupant of the public way and would have
been incurred by the Village regardless of whether or not the public way was
used or occupied by any entity other than the Village itself, including but not
limited to the costs incurred for mowing the public right-of-way.
   (d)   Legal and Consulting Fees. Public way fees shall not include
consulting or legal fees that were not directly caused by the construction
activity performed by the provider or user of the public way.

997.16(e) are not refundable.
      (8)   The Mayor may permit a provider to make quarterly or annual
payments of construction permit fees based upon the provider's financial
condition and past payment history. The quarterly or annual payments shall be
due and payable within thirty days of invoicing by the Municipality. The Mayor
may revoke this permission due to a change in financial condition, late
payment, or other just cause.

relocation of facilities in the rights of way, except for repair, maintenance
or replacement with like facilities or relocations requested or caused by a
third party (excluding the Municipality) or another permittee, a permittee
shall conduct a utility engineering study on the proposed route of construction
expansion or relocation if requested by the Municipality Engineer. Where such
construction and/or relocation is requested or caused by a third party, every
permittee located within the rights of way at issue or involved with the work
shall use all best efforts to cooperate and assist any other permittee or
person who is directed by the Municipality to perform the required utility
engineering study. A utility engineering study consists of, at minimum,
completion of the following tasks:
         A.   Secure all available “as-built” plans, plats and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all facilities along
the proposed construction route.
         B.   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
facilities along the proposed construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts and visible street cut repairs.
         C.   Determine and record the presence and precise location of all
underground facilities the applicant or person on whose behalf the permit was
applied for owns or controls in the rights of way along the proposed system
route. Upon request of the Municipality Engineer, a permittee shall also record
and identify the general location of all other facilities in the rights of way
along the proposed system route. For the purposes of this Section, general
location shall mean the alignment of other facilities in the rights of way, but
shall not necessarily mean the depth of other facilities in the rights of way.
         D.   Where the proposed location of facilities and the location of
existing underground facilities appear to conflict on the plans drafted in
accordance with Section
997.14(a)(1)D., permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive
digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified
to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
underground facilities, or re-designing the construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. Unless waived by the Municipality Engineer, a permittee
shall not excavate more than a twelve inch hole in the rights of way to
complete this task for each apparent conflict. Any surfaces damaged shall be
immediately repaired by the permittee. A minimum of two working days notice
shall be provided to the Municipality prior to performing these investigations.
         E.   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this section, adjust the proposed system design to avoid the need
to relocate other underground facilities.
      (2)   The Engineer may modify the scope of the utility engineering study
as necessary depending on the proposed construction plans.
   (b)   Copy to Municipality. Upon completion of the tasks described in
Section
997.14(a), the construction permittee shall submit, if necessary labeled in
accordance with the requirements of Section
997.06(b), the proposed system route maps and construction plans, with the
results of the utility engineering study, in the most advanced format
(including, but not be limited to electronic and/or digital format) then
currently being used by the provider that is then currently capable of
technologically being read (or readily converted to a readable form) by the
Municipality. The mapping data is only required for the Municipality to
reasonably determine the location of the provider's facilities in the rights of
way. The provider shall supply the mapping data on paper if the Municipality
Engineer determines that the format currently being used by the provider is not
capable of being read by the Municipality.
   (c)   Qualified Firm. All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this section shall be performed by the permittee if in the discretion of the
Municipality Engineer the construction permittee is qualified to complete the
project itself, alternatively utility engineering studies shall be performed by
a firm specializing in utility engineering.
   (d)   Cost of Study. The permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with
Section
997.14(a) through (c).
   (e)   Construction Schedule. Unless otherwise provided for in
Chapter 997 or in the rules and regulations, or unless the Municipality
Engineer waives any of the requirements of this section due to unique or
unusual circumstances, a permittee shall be required to submit a written
construction schedule to the Municipality not less than five working days
before commencing any work in or about the rights of way, and shall further
notify the Municipality not less than two working days in advance of any
excavation in the rights of way. This section shall apply to all situations
with the exception of circumstances under Section
997.16(d)(1) (emergency situations) and Section
997.15 (minor maintenance).
   (f)   Location of Facilities.
      (1)   The placement of new facilities and replacement of old facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable laws and the Municipality's rules and regulations. Detailed plans
and applicable specifications shall be submitted to the Municipality for review
and approval prior to construction of any facilities except those that are
categorized as “minor maintenance” issues as per Section
997.15 herein.
      (2)   The Municipality shall have the power to prohibit or limit the
placement of new or additional facilities within the rights of way if the right
of way is full. In making such decisions, the Municipality shall strive to the
extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights
of way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public health,
safety and welfare, the condition of the rights of way, the time of year with
respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the
rights of way, future Municipality and county plans for public improvements,
development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest
and nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral treatment among providers.
   (g)   Least Disruptive Technology. All construction or maintenance of
facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the rights of way. Specifically, every permittee when
performing underground construction, if technically and/or technologically
feasible and not economically unreasonable, shall utilize trenchless
technology, including, but not limited to, horizontal drilling, directional
boring, or microtunneling of pavement, driveways, and other sensitive
topographic areas. In addition, all cable, wire or fiber optic cable installed
in the subsurface rights of way pursuant to
Chapter 997 may be required to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no
cable, wire or fiber optic cable may be installed pursuant to
Chapter 997 using “direct bury” techniques.
   (h)   Special Exceptions. The Municipality may grant a special exception to
the requirements of Section
997.14(f) and
997.14(g) if a permittee, upon application, demonstrates with written evidence
that:
      (1)   The exception will not create any threat to the public health,
safety or welfare.
      (2)   Permittee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and the
potential adverse impact on the permittee's construction schedule resulting
from the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively inhibits
the ability of the permittee to provide Services in the Municipality.
      (3)   The permittee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably
discriminates against the permittee in favor of another person.
      (4)   The requirements requested by the Municipality herein create an
unreasonable economic burden for the permittee that outweighs any potential
benefit to the Municipality.
   (i)   Relocation of Facilities.
      (1)   A provider shall as promptly as reasonably possible and at its own
expense, permanently remove and relocate its facilities in the rights of way
whenever the Municipality finds it necessary to request such removal and
relocation. In instances where the Municipality requests removal and/or
relocation, the Municipality shall waive all applicable construction permit
fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the provider shall restore the rights of
way to the same or better condition it was in prior to said removal or
relocation. If existing poles are required to be removed and/or relocated, then
the existing poles will be replaced with poles of the same or similar size. In
accordance with law, the Municipality may request relocation and/or removal in
order to prevent unreasonable interference by the provider's facilities with:
         A.   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the Municipality.
         B.   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the rights of way.
         C.   The sale, conveyance, vacation, or narrowing of all or any part
of a right of way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider who has facilities in the
rights of way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the Municipality, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated
portion or excess portion in conformity with Ohio R.C. 723.04.01.
      (3)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the Municipality, a provider
fails to commence removal and/or relocation of its facilities as designated by
the Municipality, within thirty days after the Municipality's removal order, or
if a provider fails to substantially complete such removal, including all
associated repair of the rights of way of the Municipality, within twelve
months thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law,
the Municipality shall have the right to:
         A.   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the facilities
belong to the Municipality with all rights of ownership, including, but not
limited to, the right to connect and use the facilities or to effect a transfer
of all right, title and interest in the facilities to another person for
operation; or
         B.   Authorize removal of the facilities installed by the provider in,
on, over or under the rights of way of the Municipality at provider's cost and
expense, by another person; however, the Municipality shall have no liability
for any damage caused by such action and the provider shall be liable to the
Municipality for all reasonable costs incurred by the Municipality in such
action; and
         C.   To the extent consistent with applicable law, any portion of the
provider's facilities in, on, over or under the rights of way of the
Municipality designated by the Municipality for removal and not timely removed
by the provider shall belong to and become the property of the Municipality
without payment to the provider, and the provider shall execute and deliver
such documents, as the Municipality shall request, in form and substance
acceptable to the Municipality, to evidence such ownership by the Municipality.
   (j)   Pre-Excavation Facilities Location.
      (1)   Before the start date of any rights of way excavation, each
provider who has facilities located in the area to be excavated shall, to the
best of its ability, mark the horizontal and approximate vertical placement of
all its facilities.
      (2)   All providers shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of its facilities and
the best procedure for excavation.
   (k)   Rights of Way Restoration.
      (1)   The work to be done under the permit, and the restoration of the
rights of way as required herein, weather permitting, must be completed within
the dates specified in the permit. In addition to its own work, the permittee
must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including
trench backfill, paving and its foundations in accordance with the Code and
rules and regulations. If a permittee is unable to timely complete the
restoration of rights of way due to unreasonable inclement weather conditions,
the permittee shall provide interim surface restoration as directed by the
Engineer, and complete the restoration of the rights of way as soon as weather
conditions make it possible to do so and upon said completion notify the
Municipality.
      (2)   In approving an application for a construction permit, the
Municipality may choose either to have the permittee restore the rights of way
or alternatively to restore the rights of way itself if the permittee has in
the past not abided by requirements of
Chapter 997.
      (3)   If the Municipality allows a permittee to restore the rights of
way, the permittee may at the time of application for a construction permit be
required to post a construction bond in an amount submitted by the permittee
with a detailed cost breakdown to the Municipality Engineer for approval that
is sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the rights of way to its
approximate pre-excavation condition. If, twelve months after completion of the
restoration of the rights of way, the Municipality determines that the rights
of way have been properly restored, the surety on the construction bond shall
be released.
      (4)   The permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified by the Municipality. The Municipality shall have
the authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do
so in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The
Municipality in exercising this authority shall be guided by the following
standards and considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the
excavations, disruptions or damage to the rights of way; the traffic volume
carried by the rights of way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the
rights of way; the pre-excavation condition of the rights of way; the remaining
life-expectancy of the rights of way affected by the excavation; whether the
relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable
balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the rights of way
that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the
rights of way; and the likelihood that the particular method of restoration
would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the rights of way that would
otherwise take place. Methods of restoration may include, but are not limited
to, patching the affected area, replacement of the rights of way base at the
affected area, and in the most severe cases; milling, overlay and/or street
reconstruction of the entire area of the rights of way affected by the work.
      (5)   By restoring the rights of way itself, the permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for twelve months following its completion. During
this twelve month period, it shall, upon notification from the Mayor, correct
all restoration work to the extent necessary using the method required by the
Municipality Engineer. Weather permitting, said work shall be completed within
five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the Mayor, unless
otherwise extended by the Mayor.
      (6)   If the permittee fails to restore the rights of way in the manner
and to the condition required by the Municipality, or fails to satisfactorily
and timely complete all repairs required by the Municipality, the Municipality,
at its option, may do such work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the
Municipality, within thirty days of billing, the restoration cost of restoring
the rights of way and any other costs incurred by the Municipality. Upon
failure to pay, the Municipality may call upon any bond or letter of credit
posted by permittee and/or pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies.
      (7)   If the work to be done under the permit is being done at the same
location and the same period of time as work by the Municipality and/ or
another permitee(s), then the Mayor may reasonably apportion the restoration
responsibility among the Municipality, providers and/or other persons.
   (l)   Damage to Other Facilities.
      (1)   In the case of an emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the provider seeking a timely response, when the
Municipality performs work in the rights of way and finds it necessary, as may
be allowed by Law, to maintain, support, or move a provider's facilities to
protect those facilities, the costs associated therewith will be billed to that
provider and shall be paid within thirty days from the date of billing. Upon
failure to pay, the Municipality may pursue all legal and equitable remedies in
the event a provider does not pay or the Municipality may call upon any bond or
letter of credit posted by the permittee and pursue any and all legal or
equitable remedies. Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of
repairing any damage to the facilities of another provider caused during the
Municipality's response to an emergency occasioned by that provider's
facilities.
      (2)   Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
Municipality-owned facilities in the rights of way which the provider or its
facilities damage.
   (m)   Rights of Way Vacation. If the Municipality sells or otherwise
transfers a rights of way which contains the facilities of a provider, such
sale or transfer shall be subject to any existing easements of record and any
easements required pursuant to Ohio R.C. 723.041.
   (n)   Installation Requirements. The excavation, backfilling, restoration,
and all other work performed in the rights of way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, other standards as
may be promulgated by the Municipality Engineer.
   (o)   Inspection. When the construction under any permit hereunder is
completed, the permittee shall notify the Municipality.
      (1)   The permittee shall make the construction site available to the
Inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the construction.
      (2)   At the time of inspection, the Inspector may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public, violates any law or which violates the term and
conditions of the permit and/or
Chapter 997.
      (3)   The Inspector may issue an order to the permittee for any work
which does not conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or
codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be
cause for revocation of the permit. The order may be served on the permittee as
provided in Section
997.19(b). An order may be appealed to the Municipality Administrator. The
decision of the Municipality Administrator may be appealed to the Mayor whose
decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten days after issuance of the
order, the provider shall present proof to the Municipality Administrator that
the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within
the required time, the Mayor may revoke the permit pursuant to Section
997.16(e).
   (p)   Other obligations.
      (1)   Obtaining a construction permit does not relieve permittee of its
duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay
all fees required by any other laws.
      (2)   Permittee shall comply with all requirements of all laws, including
the Ohio Utility Protection Service.
      (3)   Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable
laws and standards, and is responsible for all work done in the rights of way
pursuant to its permit, regardless of who performs the work.
      (4)   No rights of way obstruction or excavation may be performed when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except
in the case of an emergency as outlined in Section
997.16(d)(1).
      (5)   Permittee shall not obstruct a rights of way so that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with. The Municipality Engineer may waive this requirement if it is
technically or economically unreasonable in the circumstances.
      (6)   Private vehicles other than necessary construction vehicles may not
be parked within or adjacent to a permit area. The loading or unloading of
trucks adjacent to a permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized
by the permit.
   (q)   Undergrounding Required. Any owner of property abutting upon a street
or alley where service facilities are now located underground and where the
service connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to
install underground any service delivery infrastructure from the property line
to the buildings or other structures on such property to which such service is
supplied. Where not otherwise required to be placed underground by
Chapter 997, a provider shall locate facilities underground at the request of
an adjacent property owner, provided that such placement of facilities
underground is consistent with the provider's normal construction and operating
standards and that the additional costs of such undergrounding over the normal
aerial or above ground placement costs of identical facilities are borne
directly by the property owner making the request. A provider, under any
circumstance shall, upon the reasonable request of the Municipality, always use
best efforts to place facilities underground. Where technically possible and
not economically unreasonable or unsafe (based upon the technology employed and
facilities installed), all facilities to be installed by a provider under the
right of way shall be installed in conduit.
(Ord. 2019-06. Passed 6-13-19.)
997.15   MINOR MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit Requirement.
      (1)   Minor maintenance means:
         A.   The routine repair or replacement of facilities with like
facilities not involving construction and not requiring traffic control; or
         B.   The routine repair or replacement of facilities with like
facilities not involving construction and taking place on thoroughfares and
arteries between the hours of 9:00 A.M. and 3:00 P.M.; or
         C.   The routine repair or replacement of facilities with like
facilities not involving construction on all rights of ways, other than
thoroughfares and arterials, that does not impede traffic; or
         D.   Construction other than on thoroughfares and arterials that does
not impede traffic and does not involve a pavement cut; or
         E.   Minor and/or non-material vegetation management/tree pruning. The
Municipality may adopt rules and regulations pursuant to Section
997.06(e) that clarify the definition of minor maintenance and/or provide a
process for a provider to determine whether particular activity constitutes
minor maintenance.
      (2)   Minor maintenance is allowed without a construction permit.
   (b)   Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit Fees. The Municipality shall not
charge a fee for the issuance of the right of way minor maintenance permit but
may revoke the right of way minor maintenance permit as any other permit may be
revoked under this chapter.
(Ord. 2019-06. Passed 6-13-19.)
997.16   ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION.
   (a)   Mandatory Denial of Permit. Except in the case of an emergency, no
permit will be granted:
      (1)   To any person who has not yet made an application; or
      (2)   To any person who has outstanding debt owed to the Municipality
unless payment in full has been placed in an escrow account approved by the
Municipality Fiscal Officer and the Municipality Solicitor; or
      (3)   To any person as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation of
a permit; or
      (4)   If, in the discretion of the Municipality Administrator, the
issuance of a permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict
or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The
Municipality Administrator, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the rights of
way, and by considerations relating to the public health, safety and welfare.
   (b)   Permissive Denial of Permit. The Municipality Administrator may deny a
permit in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to prevent
interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the rights
of way, or when necessary to protect the rights of way and its users.
      (1)   The Municipality Administrator, in his/her discretion, may consider
one or more of the following factors:
         A.   The extent to which rights of way space where the permit is
sought is available; and/or
         B.   The competing demands for the particular space in the rights of
way; and/or
         C.   The availability of other locations in the rights of way or in
other rights of way for the proposed facilities; and/or
         D.   The applicability of
Chapter 997 or other regulations of the rights of way that affect location of
facilities in the rights of way; and/or
         E.   The degree of compliance of the provider with the terms and
conditions of its certificate of registration,
Chapter 997, and other applicable ordinances and regulations; and/or
         F.   The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and
businesses that will result from the use of that part of the rights of way;
and/or
         G.   The condition and age of the rights of way, and whether and when
it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction; and/or
         H.   The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage
to the rights of way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by
the expansion into additional parts of the rights of way; and/or
         I.   Whether such applicant or its agent has failed within the past
three years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance with, the
requirements of
Chapter 997 or, if applicable, any other law.
      (2)   Under no circumstances will open cutting take place on a newly
constructed street within twenty-four months after construction completion or a
newly reconstructed street within twenty-four months of reconstruction
completion, except where:
         A.   An emergency situation requires that an open cut is necessary;
and/or
         B.   Vital services to resident(s) or business(es) are needed or have
been cut off and there is no reasonable alternative (such as jacking or boring)
in supplying or restoring such services; and/or
         C.   The Municipality Engineer determines it is in the best interests
of the Municipality that such an open cut take place.
   (c)   Discretionary Issuance of Permit.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
997.16(a)(1) and
997.16(a)(2), the Municipality Administrator may issue a permit in any case
where the permit is necessary;
         A.   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the
permit applicant, if established by credible evidence satisfactory to the
Municipality; or
         B.   To allow such customer to materially improve its service; or
         C.   To allow a new economic development project to be granted a
permit under this section.
      (2)   To be granted a permit under this section, the permit applicant
must not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of
service, or the development project when it was required to submit its list of
next year projects.
   (d)   Work Done Without a Permit in Emergency Situations.
      (1)   Each provider shall, as soon as is practicable, immediately notify
the Municipality Administrator of any event regarding its facilities which it
considers to be an emergency. The provider may proceed to take whatever actions
are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. Within five business days,
unless otherwise extended by the Municipality Engineer, after the occurrence or
discovery of the emergency (whichever is later), the provider shall apply for
the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest
of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with
Chapter 997 for any and all actions taken in response to the emergency. In the
event that the Municipality becomes aware of an emergency regarding a
provider's facilities, the Municipality shall use best efforts to contact the
provider or the system Representative of each provider affected, or potentially
affected, by the emergency. In any event, the Municipality may take whatever
action it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of
which shall be borne by the provider whose facilities caused the emergency.
      (2)   Except in the case of an emergency, any provider who constructs in,
on, above, within, over, below or through a rights of way without a valid
permit must subsequently obtain a permit, pay double the normal fee for said
permit, pay double all the other fees required by the Code, deposit with the
Municipality the fees necessary to correct any damage to the rights of way and
comply with all of the requirements of
Chapter 997.
   (e)   Revocation of Permits.
      (1)   Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to the Code as a privilege
and not as a right. The Municipality reserves its right, as provided herein, to
revoke any permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a substantial
breach of the terms and conditions of any law, or any provision or condition of
the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but shall not be
limited to, the following:
         A.   The violation of any provision or condition of the permit; or
         B.   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the Municipality or its citizens; or
         C.   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
permit; or
         D.   The failure to maintain the required construction or removal
bonds and/or insurance; or
         E.   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a
certificate of registration; or
         F.   The failure to complete the construction in a timely manner; or
         G.   The failure to correct a condition of an order issued pursuant to
Section
997.14(o)(3).
      (2)   If the Municipality Administrator determines that the permittee has
committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any law or any
condition of the permit, the Municipality Administrator shall serve a written
demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that
continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Upon a
substantial breach, as stated above, the Municipality Administrator may place
additional or revised conditions on the permit.
      (3)   By the close of the second business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the Municipality
Administrator with a plan, acceptable to the Municipality Administrator, for
its correction. Permittee's failure to so contact the Municipality
Administrator, or the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or
permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause
for immediate revocation of the permit.
      (4)   If a permittee commits a second substantial default as outlined
above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and the permittee will
not be allowed further permits for up to and including one full year, except
for emergency repairs.
      (5)   If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the
Municipality for the Municipality's reasonable costs, including restoration
costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in
connection with such revocation.
(Ord. 2019-06. Passed 6-13-19.)
997.17   CONSTRUCTION AND REMOVAL BONDS.
   (a)   Construction Bond. Prior to the commencement of any construction, a
construction permittee, excluding the Municipality and the county, shall
deposit with the Municipality an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit
and/or surety bond in an amount determined by the Municipality Solicitor to be
appropriate based upon fair and reasonable criteria. Unless a construction
default, problem or deficiency involves an emergency or endangers the safety of
the general public, the Municipality shall serve written notice to the
construction permittee detailing the construction default, problem or
deficiency. If the Municipality determines that correction or repair of the
construction default, problem or deficiency has not occurred or has not been
substantially initiated within ten calendar days after the date following
service and notification and detailing the construction default, problem or
deficiency, then the Municipality may attach the letter of credit or surety
bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be served on the construction
permittee by the Municipality.
   (b)   Removal Bond. Upon issuance of a certificate of registration and
continuously thereafter, and until one hundred twenty days after a provider's
facilities have been removed from the rights of way, (unless the Municipality
notifies the provider that a reasonably longer period shall apply), a provider
shall deposit with the Municipality and maintain an irrevocable, unconditional
letter of credit or surety bond in an amount equal to or greater than One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00), the Municipality shall make all
reasonable efforts to allow provider a period of five calendar days after
serving notification in writing to correct or repair any default, problem or
deficiency prior to the Municipality attachment of the letter of credit or
surety bond regarding the removal of facilities. Upon attachment, written
notice shall be provided to the provider by the Municipality.
   (c)   Blanket Bond.

costs, liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of any kind arising out of
the construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair or operation of
its facilities, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a rights of way,

waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the provider,
permittee or to the Municipality; and the provider or permittee, in defending
any action on behalf of the Municipality, shall be entitled to assert in any
action every defense or immunity that the Municipality could assert in its own
behalf. Any and all exercise of the above shall be consistent with, but not

hold harmless the Municipality, its elected officials, agents, officers,
employees, volunteers and subcontractors from and against any and all lawsuits,

for injury or damages (including, but not limited to, expenses for reasonable
legal fees, costs and expenses assumed by the Municipality in connection
therewith); and
         B.   Persons or property, in any way arising out of or through the
acts or omissions of provider or permittee, its subcontractors, agents or
employees attributable to the occupation by the provider or permittee of the
rights of way, to which provider's or permittee's negligence shall in any way
contribute, and regardless of whether the Municipality's negligence or the
negligence of any other party shall have contributed to such claim, cause of
action, judgment, injury or damage; and
         C.   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy,
for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement
of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other
right of any person, firm and corporation by the provider, but excluding claims
arising out of or related to the Municipality's actions; and
         D.   Arising out of provider or permittee's failure to comply with the
provisions of law applicable to provider or permittee in its business

defense thereof, and the provider or permittee shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such separate counsel if employed.

granting of a permit or by issuing a certificate of registration pursuant to

the Municipality under the Constitution and Laws of the United States, State of
Ohio or the Municipality to regulate the use of the rights of way. The
permittee by its acceptance of a permit, or provider by applying for and being
issued a certificate of registration, is deemed to acknowledge that all lawful
powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as now are
or the same as may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the
Municipality, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise
thereof by the Municipality at any time. A permittee or provider is deemed to
acknowledge that its rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of
the Municipality to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the
safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all
applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the Municipality pursuant to
such powers.

legislative authority may adopt (and from time to time amend) the rules and
regulations regarding

any way be considered a material increase in obligation; the adoption of rules
and regulations increasing fees; the requiring of the placement of facilities
in designated portions of the rights of way (underground or otherwise); the
overbuilding of facilities; or the requiring of joint-builds. Prior to the
adoption or amendment of the rules and regulations, the Municipality shall
provide written notice and a copy of the proposed language of such adoption or
amendment, via electronic mail, to each provider who holds a current
certificate of registration. Each provider shall then have thirty days
following the date of the Municipality's mailing to provide written comment
regarding the proposed language to the Municipality. At least forty-five days,
but not more than sixty days following the date of the Municipality's
notification, the Municipality shall schedule and hold a meeting, to make
available a forum at which all then current providers may address any
questions, concerns and make reasonable suggestions regarding the proposed new
rules and regulations to the Municipality. The Municipality Engineer shall,
following said meeting and the review of the providers' comments and
suggestions, adopt or amend the rules and regulations in a manner that best
serves the Municipality, for approval by the legislative authority.
   (c)   Method of Service. Any notice or order of the Mayor, Municipality
Administrator, Municipality Fiscal Officer, Municipality Council, or
Municipality Engineer shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy thereof

known fax number of the person to be served or via electronic mail; or

Chapter 997 shall apply to all providers and all permittees unless expressly
exempted.

      (1)   Upon the filing of any voluntary or involuntary petition under the

foreclosure or other judicial sale of the provider and/or permittee facilities
located within the rights of way, the provider and/or permittee shall so notify
the Municipality Administrator within fourteen calendar days thereof and the
provider and/or permittee's certificate of registration or permit (as
applicable) shall be deemed void and of no further force and effect.

provisions of the Code, any certificate of registration or permit granted
pursuant to
Chapter 997, subject to any applicable provisions of law, including the
Bankruptcy Code, one hundred and twenty days after the appointment of a
receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of the provider and/
or permittee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other
action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been
vacated prior to the expiration of said one hundred and twenty days or unless:
         A.   Within one hundred and twenty days after election or appointment,
such receiver or trustee shall have fully complied with all the provisions of
the relevant certificate of registration, any outstanding permit,
Chapter 997, and remedied all defaults thereunder; and
         B.   Said receiver or trustee, within said one hundred and twenty
days, shall have executed an agreement, duly approved by a court having
jurisdiction over the facilities, whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and
agrees to be bound by each and every provision of the relevant certificate of
registration, permit and
Chapter 997.
   (f)   Choice of Law and Forum. This
Chapter 997 and the terms and conditions of any certificate of registration or
permit shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the substantive laws
of the Municipality, State of Ohio and United States, in that order. As a
condition of the grant of any permit or issuance of any certificate of
registration, unless otherwise required by law, all disputes shall be resolved

   (g)   Force Majeure. In the event any person’s performance of any of the
terms, conditions or obligations required by
Chapter 997 is prevented by a cause or event not within such person's control,
such inability to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions
shall be imposed as a result thereof. For the purpose of this section, causes
or events not within the control of a provider shall include, without
limitation, acts of God, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances,

regarding its right to authorize the construction of facilities on any
particular rights of way. The burden and responsibility for making such
determination shall be upon the person installing facilities in the rights of
way.
   (i)   Continuing Obligation and Holdover. In the event a provider or
permittee continues to operate all or any part of the facilities after the
termination, lapse, or revocation of a certificate of registration, such
provider or permittee shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions
of this chapter and other laws throughout the period of such continued
operation, provided that any such continued operation shall in no way be
construed as a renewal or other extension of the certificate of registration,
nor as a limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the Municipality as a
result of such continued operation after the term, including, but not limited
to, damages and restitution. Any conflict between the issuance of a certificate
of registration or of a permit and any other present or future lawful exercise
of the Municipality's regulatory or police powers shall be resolved in favor of
the latter.

to the Municipality required by this chapter shall be in writing and sent via

1109.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to specify the procedures that shall be
followed to subdivide and the general requirements that need to be satisfied.
(Ord. 7A-1977. Passed 6-14-77.)
1109.02   CLASSIFICATION AND DETERMINATION OF SUBDIVISION TYPE.
   (a)   There are two (2) basic types of subdivisions:
      (1)   Minor subdivision. The Perry Village Planning Commission, through a
designated representative, may determine that a proposed subdivision of land is
a minor subdivision if the proposed division of a parcel of land is along an
existing public street, and does not involve the opening, widening, or
extension of any street or road, does not involve more than five (5) lots after
the original tract has been completely subdivided, and is not contrary to
applicable zoning regulations or applicable subdivision regulations.
      (2)   Major subdivision. Any proposed subdivision that does not meet the
requirements of a minor subdivision and including the improvement of parcels of
land for residential, commercial, or industrial structures or groups of
structures which may or may not be ultimately jointly-owned under a recorded
condominium property declaration. Condominium subdivision shall cease to be
subject to these regulations at such time that an appropriate condominium
declaration has been prepared for the property as already improved under these
regulations and said declaration is in the process of submission for recording
under the provisions of Chapter 5311 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)   Land Contract. The transfer of ownership of a parcel or parcels of
land by Land Installment Contract (Land Contract) shall not exempt a developer
from the requirements of subdivision plat approval as specified in these
Regulations.
(Ord. 7A-1977. Passed 6-14-77.)
1109.03   MINOR SUBDIVISION.
   (a)   Planning Commission May Grant Authority of Review and Approval. The
Planning Commission may designate a representative to review and approve a
minor subdivision.
   (b)   Preapplication Meeting. The subdivider shall meet with the Perry
Village Planning Commission, or its representative, prior to the submission of
plans. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss early and informally the
purpose and effect of these Regulations on the proposed subdivision. The
appropriate forms shall be obtained (See Appendix A and Appendix B).
   (c)   Submission to Planning Commission. Any person proposing to create a
minor subdivision shall submit the following to the Perry Village Planning
Commission.
      (1)   The instrument of conveyance. (See Appendix A.) The conveyance
shall contain a description of the parcel or parcels sought to be transferred.
The conveyance shall be accomplished by the recording of a deed rather than a
plat. The party or parties desiring to make the transfer shall submit a sketch
thereof to the Commission's authorized representative. If the division conforms
to appropriate standards, and requirements established herein, the responsible
official may stamp same "Approved, No Plat Required", and attach his signature,
and the appropriate transfer may then be recorded. In no case where a division
takes place, may the remaining portion of the tract be less than the minimum
allowable lot size. However, if the owner of the property does not agree with
any of the requirements specified by the Commission, or its duly appointed
representative, he may then appeal to the Planning Commission for approval for
recording and such approval must be obtained before the transfer can be
recorded. No preliminary or final plan other than the rough sketch of the
division shall be required.
      (2)   A statement by the owner that the parcel or parcels of land created
comply with existing Village Zoning Regulations and certified as such by the
Zoning Inspector of the Village in which land sought to be transferred is
located.
      (3)   A statement of recommendation by the County Health Board (or the
County Sanitary Engineer where public sewers are required) for approval of
transfer in one (1) of the following forms:
         A.   Approved for building sites (valid for one (1) year):
            1.   Public Sewer required by Lake County Sanitary Engineer.
            2.   Public Sewer not required by Lake County Sanitary Engineer.
Individual sewage systems have been approved by the Lake County Health Board.
         B.   Approved for transfer: No building site approval granted.
      (4)   Minor subdivision fees.
   (d)   Submission to Tax Map Department. After approval and conveyance by the
Planning Commission, the following, bearing the approval stamp of the Planning
Commission, shall be presented to the Tax Map Department. At this time the Tax
Map Department shall collect appropriate fee.
   (e)   Submission to the Auditor. Following approval and conveyance by the
Tax Map Department, the conveyance bearing the approval stamp of the Tax Map
Department shall be presented to the Auditor for approval. At this time the
Auditor shall collect appropriate fees.
   (f)   Submission to the Recorder. Following approval of the conveyance by
the Auditor, the conveyance bearing the stamp of the Auditor shall be presented
to the Recorder for recording. At this time the Recorder shall collect
appropriate fees.
   (g)   Minor Subdivision Requirements. All minor subdivisions shall meet with
the following regulations:
   The sketch (see Section
1109.03(c)) shall indicate the following information:
      (1)   Approximate location of low, wet, or swampy areas and existing
drainage courses, including storm sewers, tile lines and roadway culverts,
where known.
      (2)   The general location of all structures on the parcel and on the
land from which the parcel is being split, if within fifty (50) feet of the new
line.
      (3)   The amount of acreage in total and in each lot and the amount of
acreage in road right-of-way and other easements.
      (4)   The location of power lines or other utility easements, where
known.
      (5)   The proposed building set-back lines.
      (6)   Approximate location of any other unusual feature such as large
rock outcroppings or underground mines, gas wells, driveways, etc., where
known.
      (7)   Any other information deemed necessary by the Planning Commission.
   (h)   Action by the Planning Commission. Approval without a plat of a Minor
Subdivision shall be granted by the Planning Commission if the proposed
division of a parcel of land meets all of the following requirements:
      (1)   The proposed subdivision is located along an existing public street
and involves no opening, widening, or extension of any street;
      (2)   No more than five (5) lots are involved after the original tract
has been completely subdivided;
      (3)   The proposed subdivision is not contrary to applicable subdivision
or zoning regulations. Within fifteen (15) working days after submission of a
Minor Subdivision or within a mutually agreed upon extension, the Planning
Commission shall either approve or disapprove the application for transfer
without a record plat. The approval shall expire within sixty (60) days, unless
the conveyances are recorded in the office of the County Recorder during said
period. If the Planning Commission representative does not approve the
transfer, he shall notify the applicant, in writing, stating the reason for
disapproval.
   (i)   Action by Tax Map Department. The Tax Map Department shall review each
major and minor subdivision and each transfer of ownership to assure proper
chain of title, tax map accuracy and compliance with requirements contained
herein. The approval shall expire within sixty (60) days, unless the
conveyances are recorded in the office of the County Recorder during said
period.
(Ord. 7A-1977. Passed 6-14-77.)
1109.04   MAJOR SUBDIVISION.
   (a)   General Procedure. Major subdivision shall be approved in four (4)
stages; preliminary discussion stage, preliminary plan stage, improvement plan
stage, and the final plat stage.
      (1)   The preliminary discussion stage requires the subdivider to discuss
the proposed subdivision with the Planning Commission, Mayor, Village Engineer,
County Sanitary Engineer, and the County Health Board so that he can become
familiar with subdivision requirements, existing conditions and future plans.
      (2)   The preliminary plan and supplementary data stage requires the
subdivider to present to the Planning Commission all information needed to
determine that the proposed layout is satisfactory and will serve the public
interest. This stage also ensures that the subdivider will not be required to
expend excessive monies without some assurance that his plat will be finally
approved.
      (3)   The improvement plan stage requires the subdivider to present all
data needed to determine that the subdivision fully complies with these
Regulations and conforms to the approved improvement plan. After approval of
all streets, highways, or other public ways or open space by the Planning
Commission, the plat shall then, following approval of the Tax Map Department
and Auditor, be transferred and recorded by the County Recorder, at the
developer's expense, and kept in a permanent file by the Village Engineer.
   (b)   Preliminary Discussion. The subdivider shall consult with the offices
of the Planning Commission, the Village Engineer, the County Sanitary Engineer
where applicable and the County Health Board and avail himself of the advice
and assistance of these offices. He shall submit a preliminary discussion map
including all items required by Section
1113.02 and shall obtain a preliminary plan checklist (see Appendix C), the
Major Subdivision Approval Procedures form (see Appendix D), and the
Preliminary Plan Application (see Appendix E).
   (c)   Preliminary Plan Procedure.
      (1)   Submission of preliminary plan and supplementary information. The
subdivider shall make application to the Planning Commission for approval of a
preliminary plan. All information required by Section
1113.03 shall be submitted to the Commission on the preliminary plan at least
(15) fifteen working days before the meeting of the Planning Commission's
Zoning and Subdivision Review Committee, at which time the application will be

         F.   Preliminary plan fees.
      (2)   Transmission of preliminary plan. The Planning Commission shall
transmit a copy of the preliminary plan to the following officials and agencies
for their review and recommendations.

         C.   County Sanitary Engineer, (where applicable).
         D.   County Board of Health.
   The Commission may transmit additional copies of the preliminary plan
documents to school boards and other agencies as they deem necessary. The
officials and agencies shall make their review and recommendations to the
Commission within ten (10) days from the date of transmission.
An agreeable date, to parties concerned, shall be arranged for a viewing of the
site in the field, if required by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Official filing of preliminary plan. Upon determination by the
Staff of the Commission that the preliminary plan has been properly submitted,
the preliminary plan shall be accepted as being officially filed.
      (4)   Public hearing. The Commission, on its own initiative or upon
petition by neighboring property owner may, prior to acting on a preliminary
plan of a subdivision, hold a public hearing thereon at such time and upon such
notice as the Commission may designate.
      (5)   Planning Commission action.
         A.   The Commission shall act within forty five (45) days from the
date of official filing or within a mutually agreed upon time extension;
otherwise the preliminary plan shall be deemed to have been approved.
         B   The action shall be noted on the preliminary plan and a copy
returned to the subdivider. The action shall also be entered on the official
records of the Commission and a copy of the preliminary plan with action noted
kept on file and a copy with action noted sent to the Village Engineer.
         C.   Approval of the preliminary plan shall be conditional upon
compliance with these Regulations (including the Comprehensive Development
Plan) and all applicable statutes, resolutions, regulations, and standards that
effect the proposed subdivision.
         D.   If a preliminary plan is disapproved, the reasons for such
disapproval, including citation of or reference to the rule or regulation
violated shall be stated upon the record of the Commission and a copy of the

shall be retained by the Commission for its files.
         E.   In the event of disapproval, one half of the fee filed for this
stage of the Regulations shall be returned to the subdivider by the Village.
      (6)   Effect of approval. Approval of a preliminary plan by the
Commission is not an acceptance of the subdivision for record. It is an
approval of a general plan as a guide for the preparation of improvement plans
and a subdivision plat for final approval and recording upon fulfillment of all
requirements of these Regulations. Approval of a preliminary plan shall be
effective for a period of one (1) year following the date of approval by the
Commission unless an extension of time is granted. Upon expiration of a
preliminary plan approval, no approval of a final plat shall be given until the

with all requirements of these Regulations. It shall contain all information
such as contours, wooded areas, etc., used only for preliminary study.
         D.   The Commission's authorized agent shall forward copies of the
improvement plan to such officials and agencies as may be necessary for the

subdivider shall have the minimum required improvement installed, inspected,
and approved by the Village Engineer and/or County Sanitary Engineer, where
applicable. However, the Commission may give final approval before all required
improvements are installed, authorizing its Secretary to sign the plat at such

1117.05    Fire protection.
   CROSS REFERENCES
      Cornerstones and permanent markers - see Ohio R.C. 711.03, 711.14
1117.01   PHYSICAL CONSIDERATIONS.
   (a)   Natural Land Use. Subdivision shall be planned to take advantage of
the topography of the land, to economize in the construction of drainage
facilities, to reduce the amount of grading, and to minimize destruction of
trees and topsoil.
   (b)   Flood Hazard. If any portion of the land within the subdivision is
subject to flooding (flood plains, sewer overflow elevations, etc.) or other
hazards, due consideration shall be given to such problems in the design of the
subdivision. Land subject to flooding, wetlands, and land otherwise
uninhabitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy nor for such other
uses that may increase danger to health, life, or property, or aggravate the
flood hazard.
   (c)   Erosion Control. Whenever the topographic or surface features of a
site are being altered, a plan suitable to the Village Planning Commission
showing provisions for control of erosion and sedimentation during and after
the development, construction, or other use of the site shall be prepared.
   Effective erosion and sediment controls shall be planned and applied
according to the following principles.
      (1)   Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
critical areas exposed during development, use, etc.
      (2)   Sediment basins (debris basins, desilting basin, or silt traps)
shall be installed and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters from
land undergoing development, use, etc.
      (3)   The permanent final vegetation and structures shall be installed as
soon as practical in the development, use, restoration, rehabilitation, etc.
      (4)   The development, or use plan shall be fitted to the topography and
soils so as to create the least erosion potential.
      (5)   Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and
protected.
(Ord. 7A-1977. Passed 6-14-77.)
      (6)   Swales and ditch banks shall be seeded as soon after construction
as possible.
(Ord 10-1979. Passed 6-7-79.)
1117.02   STREETS.
   (a)   Design and Arrangement.
      (1)   The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision
for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining areas (or
their proper projection where adjoining land is not subdivided) insofar as they
may be deemed necessary for public requirements.
      (2)   The street arrangement shall be such as to not cause hardship to
owners of adjoining property when they plat their own land and seek to provide
for convenient access to it. Residential streets shall be so designed as to
discourage through traffic. Offset streets should be avoided except as they are
not less than five hundred (500) feet at their access points on a collector
street.
      (3)   The angle of intersection between minor streets and major streets
should not vary more than ten (10) degrees from a right angle. All other
streets should intersect each other as near to a right angle as possible and no
intersection of streets at angles of less than seventy (70) degrees shall be
permitted. Multiple intersections involving more than two (2) streets shall be
prohibited.
      (4)   Residential streets shall be designed to discourage through traffic
which may otherwise use secondary or major highways, and whose origin and
destination are not within the subdivision. Residential streets extending for
considerable distance, parallel to any secondary or major street, should be
avoided. Looping of utilities on streets should be encouraged.
      (5)   Streets planned to serve multi-family, business or industrial areas
shall connect directly to Major or Collector streets, so as to not generate
large volumes of traffic on local residential streets.
(Ord. 7A-1977. Passed 6-14-77.)
      (6)   Cul-de-sac streets shall be provided with a turnaround having a
minimum right-of-way radius of 100 feet and a maximum depth of 800 feet
measured from the centerline of the engineering section and including the
turnaround. The outside of the road service within the turnaround right of way
shall have a minimum radius of 40 feet. Interior islands may be required at the
discretion of the Planning Commission, such islands shall be maintained by the
adjoining property owners. If the adjoining property owners do not maintain the
interior islands, then they shall be maintained by the Village and prorata
costs of such maintenance shall be charged to the adjoining property owners.
(Ord. 10-1979. Passed 6-7-79.)
      (7)   Dead-End-Streets: Streets designated to be dead-ended permanently
shall not be permitted. Any dead-end street of a temporary nature, if longer
than four hundred (400) feet or fronted by existing lots, shall have a surfaced
turning area equal in diameter to the right-of-way width of said street at its
termination.
      (8)   Half Streets: Half streets shall not be prohibited.
      (9)   Service Streets: Service streets shall be avoided in single or two-
family districts. They may, however, be required in multiple dwelling
developments. Service streets are required in the rear of all commercial and
industrial lots if no other provisions are made for adequate service access or
for parking. The rights-of-way of such service streets shall not be less than
thirty (30) feet and dead-end service streets shall not be permitted.
   (b)   Alignment.
      (1)   Vertical: For main thoroughfares, profile grades shall be connected
by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent to twenty (20) times the
algebraic difference between the rates of grade, expressed in feet per hundred;
for secondary and minor streets and alleys, fifteen (15) times.
      (2)   Horizontal: Minimum horizontal radii, a maximum degree of
centerline curvature:
 
Article Highways            8° 650 ft.

Minor Streets               28°200 ft.
Streets 800 feet or shorter 53°100 ft.
 
      (3)   A tangent shall be introduced between reverse curves as follows:
         Minor - 50'
         Collector - 100'
         Major Artery - 200'
      (4)   Visibility Requirements:
         A.   Minimum vertical visibility (measured 4-1/2 ft. eye level to tail
light 18" above ground level).
            900 ft. on limited access arterials
            500 ft. on main thoroughfares

         B.   Minimum horizontal visibility shall be: (measured on centerline)
            900 ft. on limited access arterials
            500 ft. on main thoroughfares
            300 ft. on secondary thoroughfares
            100 ft. on all other streets
(Ord. 7A-1977. Passed 6-14-77.)
   (c)   Street and Alley Width.
      (1)   The width of all major thoroughfares shall conform to the widths
designated on the Major Highway Plan, or Comprehensive Plan of Perry Village
and Lake County, Ohio. However, in no case shall the width of all major
thoroughfares be less than twenty-four feet and the width of any one lane of
travel in a major thoroughfare be less than twelve feet.
(Ord. 10-1979. Passed 6-7-79.)
      (2)   The minimum right-of-way widths for streets and alleys are as
follows:

* More right-of-way may be required in areas where ditches are used in place of
curbs and gutters as determined by the Commission.
** As specified by major thoroughfare plan or as determined by the Commission.
   (d)   Street Grades.
      (1)   Vertical curves. No street grade shall be less than ½ percent and
shall not exceed the following with due allowances for reasonable vertical
curves:
 
A. Main or arterial thoroughfares           5%
Secondary thoroughfares                     6%

      (2)   Cross section. The gradients of streets shall be not less than 0.5
percent without curb and gutter and 0.3 percent with curb and gutter. On
streets where curbs, gutters and sidewalks are not required, there shall be a
berm, the width of which shall be determined by the applicable street cross-
section as determined by the Commission.
   (e)   Street Jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one
hundred sixty (160) feet shall be prohibited. If deemed necessary by the
Commission, the minimum distance between center line offsets may be increased
or adjusted.
   (f)   Corner Radii. The radii on both pavement edge and right-of-way is to
be thirty (30) feet minimum at all points of roadway intersection.
(Ord. 7A-1977. Passed 6-14-77.)
1117.03   EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Building Lines. Building lines shall be established according to the
front yard requirements set forth in the Village Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   Easements. Easements of at least ten (10) feet in width shall be
provided on each side of all rear lot lines, along side lot lines, and front
lot lines where necessary, for utilities. Easements may also be required along
or across lots where engineering design or special conditions may necessitate
the installation of water and sewer lines outside public right-of-way. For lots
facing on curvilinear streets, the rear easement shall consist of straight
lines with a minimum number of points of deflection. The Planning Commission
may alter these easements as required.
   (c)   Easement Along Streams. Whenever any stream or important surface
drainage course is located in the area being subdivided, the subdivider shall
provide an adequate easement as determined by the Planning Commission along
each side of the stream for the purpose of widening, deepening, relocating or
protecting the stream for drainage or public use.
(Ord. 7A-1977. Passed 6-14-77.)
1117.04   BLOCKS.
   (a)   The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due
regard to:
      (1)   Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs
of the type of use contemplated.
      (2)   Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions.
      (3)   Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of
street traffic.
      (4)   Limitations and opportunities of topography.
   (b)   Block Design.
      (1)   Length. No block shall be longer than 1,200 feet nor less than 500
feet, except in unusual circumstances subject to approval of the Planning
Commission. Where a subdivision adjoins a major highway, the greater dimension
of the block shall front along such major highway to minimize the number of
points of ingress or egress.
      (2)   Crosswalk. Where blocks are over 750 feet in length, a crosswalk
easement not less than fifteen (15) feet in width may be required if necessary
to provide proper access through the block. Necessity shall be determined by
the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Commercial industrial. Blocks for multifamily, business or
industrial subdivision shall be designed to accommodate the building sites and
provide yards, service drives, required off-street parking, and other such
required facilities for unit development as required for traffic control,
safety, and standards of good design.
      (4)   Bikeways. Recognizing that the bicycle is a legitimate form of
transportation that is increasing in use, the Perry Village Planning Commission
strongly recommends that bikeways be planned and constructed as an integral
part of all subdivisions. It is recommended that the width of the bikeway be
ten (10) feet and be constructed as recommended by the Village Engineer.
   (c)   Lots.
      (1)   Arrangement. The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all
lots will provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related
to topography, natural land features, and the character of surrounding

1301.01   ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective March 1, 2005, and as identified
and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be liberally
construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official finds
that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions of
this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved by
the Building Official pursuant to Section 118 of the Ohio Building Code shall
be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.
(OBC 101.3)
1301.03   SCOPE.
   The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall apply to the construction,
alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and
occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and demolition of every building or
structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings or
structures. As provided in Section 3791.04(B) of the Ohio Revised Code, no
plans or specifications shall be approved or inspection approval given unless
the building represented by those plans or specifications would, if
constructed, repaired, erected or equipped according to those plans or
specifications, comply with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code and
any rules adopted by the Board.
   An owner may exceed the requirements of the Ohio Building Code in compliance
with Section 102.7 of the Ohio Building Code.
   Exceptions:
   (a)   Detached one-, and two-, and three-family dwellings and structures
incidental to those dwellings which are not constructed as industrialized units
shall comply with local residential codes, if any, adopted by the authority
having jurisdiction. This exception does not include the energy provisions
required in "Chapter 13, Energy Efficiency" of the OBC (see Sections 3781.06,
3781.181 and 3781.182 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (b)   Buildings owned by and used for a function of the United States
Government;
   (c)   Buildings or structures which are incident to the use for agricultural
purposes of the land on which said buildings or structures are located,
provided such buildings or structures are not used in the business of retail
trade; for the purposes of this section, a building or structure is not
considered used in the business of retail trade if fifty percent or more of the
gross income received from sales of products in the building or structure by
the owner or operator is from sales of products produced or raised in a normal
crop year on farms owned or operated by the seller. (See Sections 3781.06 and
3781.061 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (d)   Agricultural labor camps;
   (e)   Type A or Type B family day-care homes;
   (f)   Buildings or structures which are designed, constructed and maintained
in accordance with federal standards and regulations and are used primarily for
federal and state military purposes where the U.S. Secretary of Defense,
pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Sections 18233(a)(1) and 18237, has acquired by purchase,
lease, or transfer, and constructs, expands, rehabilitates, or corrects and
equips, such buildings or structures as he determines to be necessary to carry
out the purposes of Chapter 1803 of the U.S.C.;
   (g)   Manufactured homes constructed under "24 CFR Part 3280", "Manufactured
Home Construction and Safety Standards".
(OBC 101.2)
1301.04   COMPLIANCE.
   (a)   No owner or any other person shall construct, erect, build or equip
any building or structure to which the Ohio Building Code is applicable, or
make any addition thereto or alteration thereof, except in case of repairs for
maintenance without affecting the construction, sanitation, safety or other
vital feature of such building or structure, without complying with this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791 or the Ohio Building Code, or fail to
comply with any lawful order issued pursuant thereto.
(ORC 3791.01, 3791.02)
   (b)   No architect, builder, engineer, plumber, carpenter, mason,
contractor, subcontractor, foreman or employee shall violate or assist in
violating this chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791 or the Ohio Building
Code, or fail to comply with any lawful order issued pursuant thereto.
(ORC 3791.01, 3791.03)
   (c)   No owner shall proceed with the construction, erection, alteration or
equipment of any building to which the Ohio Building Code is applicable until
the plans or drawings, specifications, and data have been approved as Ohio R.C.
3791.04 requires, or the industrialized unit inspected at the point of origin.
No plans or specifications shall be approved or inspection approval given
unless the building represented would, if constructed, repaired, erected, or
equipped comply with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rule made under those chapters. (ORC 3791.04)
1301.05   EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   The provisions of Chapter 34 of the Ohio Building Code shall control the
alteration, repair, addition, and change of occupancy of any existing
structure.
   The occupancy of any structure currently existing on the date of adoption of
this Code shall be permitted to continue without change provided the alleged
occupancy can be shown to have existed for more than two years and there are no
orders of the Building Official pending, no evidence of fraud, or no serious
safety or sanitation hazard.
   Buildings constructed in accordance with plans which have been approved
prior to the effective date of this Code are existing buildings.
(OBC 102.6)
1301.06   VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Adjudication Orders Required Before Legal Proceedings. Before the
Municipality attempts to enforce Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised
Code or any rules adopted pursuant thereto, by any remedy, civil or criminal,
it shall issue an adjudication order within the meaning of Sections 119.06 to
119.13 of the Ohio Revised Code or a stop work order as provided in Section
1301.07. Every adjudication order shall:
      (1)   Cite the law or rules directly involved and shall specify what
appliances, site preparations, additions, or alterations to structures, plans,
materials, assemblages or procedures are necessary for the same to comply with
Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   Include notice to the party of the procedure for appeal and right
to a hearing if requested within thirty days of the mailing of the notice. The
notice shall also inform the party that at the hearing he may be represented by
counsel, present his arguments or contentions orally or in writing and present
evidence and examine witnesses appearing for or against him.
   (b)   Notice of Violation. The Building Official is authorized to serve a
notice of violation or order on the person responsible for the erection,
construction, alteration, extension, repair, moving, removal, demolition or
occupancy of a building or structure. When the Building Official finds that
work or equipment is contrary to approved construction documents and the rules
of the Board of Building Standards, the Building Official shall send a notice
in writing to the owner of said building or the owner's agent which shall state
where and in what respect the work or equipment does not conform to the
approved plans for same and the rules of the Board. The notice shall specify a
reasonable period of time in which to conform to said plans or the rules of the
Board. Before any work may continue on the construction, erection, alteration,
or equipment of any building for which the approval is invalid, the owner of
the building shall resubmit the plans or drawings and specifications for
approval as required under Section 105.3 of the Ohio Building Code.
   (c)   Prosecution of Violation. Upon the issuance of any order provided for
in this section or Section
1301.07, the person receiving an order shall cease work upon the site
preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or shall cease using the
appliance, materials, assemblages or manufactured product identified in the
order until such time as the appeal provided for in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3781.19 of the Ohio Revised Code and all appeals from
such hearing have been completed, or the order has been released.
(OBC 113)
1301.07   STOP WORK ORDER.
   (a)   Authority. Whenever the Building Official finds any work regulated by
this Code being performed in a manner contrary to the provisions of this Code
or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, the Building Official is authorized to
issue a stop work order whenever the Building Official finds, after inspection,
that the site preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or that the use of an
appliance, materials, assemblage, or manufactured product does not comply with
the provisions of Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code or the rules
adopted pursuant thereto. The effect of such an order shall be limited to the
matter specified in the order.
   (b)   Issuance. The stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given
to the owner of the property involved, or to the owner's agent and the person
doing the work. Upon issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall
immediately cease. The stop work order shall state the reason for the order,
and the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume.
   (c)   Unlawful Continuance. Any person who shall continue any work after
having been served with a stop work order, except such work as that person is
directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition. Failure to cease
work after receipt of a stop work order is hereby declared a public nuisance.
(OBC 114)
1301.08   CONFLICT.
   (a)   General. Where, in any specific case, different sections of the Ohio
Building Code specify different materials, methods of construction or other
requirements, the most restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict
between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific
requirement shall be applicable.
   (b)   Other Laws. The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall not be
deemed to nullify any provisions of state or federal law. The Municipality,
under Section 3781.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, may make further and additional
regulations, not in conflict with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised
Code or with the rules of the Board of Building Standards. However, under
Section 3781.12 of the Ohio Revised Code, approval by the Board of Building
Standards of any fixture, device, material, system, assembly or product of a
manufacturing process, or method or manner of construction or installation
shall constitute approval for their use anywhere in Ohio. The rules of the
Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order, standard, or
rule of the Division of the Fire Marshal or Industrial Compliance in the
Department of Commerce, and Department of Health and of counties and townships,
in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are in conflict with the
rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that rules adopted and orders
issued by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Chapter 3743, of the Ohio Revised Code
prevail in the event of a conflict.
(OBC 102)

state where and in what respect the work or equipment does not conform to the
approved plans for same and the rules of the Board, and specify a reasonable
period of time in which to conform to said plans or the rules of the Board.

1309.01   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   (a)   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health,
safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize further flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
the near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (b)   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods
and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filing, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (c)   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard
within the jurisdiction of Perry Village, including any additional areas of
special flood hazard annexed by Perry Village, as identified in subsection (d)
of this section.
   (d)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study, Lake County, Ohio and incorporated areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map, Lake County and incorporated areas effective May 4,
2021.
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by Perry Village.
      (3)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at Perry Village Hall, 3758 Center Road, Perry, Ohio
44081.
   (e)   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations are not intended to repeal,
abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions.
However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement or covenant or deed
restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.
   (f)   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all
provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (g)   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and
engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.
Flood heights may be increased by man made or natural causes. These regulations
do not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These
regulations shall not create liability on the part of Perry Village any officer
or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (h)   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by
the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect
the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the
part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on flood boundary and floodway maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (r)   "Floodproofing." Any combination of structural and non-structural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents.
   (s)   "Flood protection elevation." The flood protection elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus two feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (t)   "Floodway." A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (u)   "Freeboard." A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (v)   "Historic structure." Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office;
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the Lake County Historical Society's historic preservation program as
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (w)   "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis." An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (x)   "Letter of map change (LOMC)." An office FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary
and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of map amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of map revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical date
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or a parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR). A comment by FEMA
regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the
hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in
the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood
elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does not amend or revise
effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, or flood
insurance studies.
   (y)   "Limit of moderate wave action (LiMWA)." A line shown on a flood
insurance rate map to indicate the inland limit of the 1.5-ft. breaking wave
height during the base flood.
   (z)   "Lowest floor." The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (aa)   "Manufactured home." A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a recreational vehicle. For the

referenced.
   (cc)   "Manufactured home park." As specified in the Ohio Administrative
Code 4781-12-01(K), a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which
three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free
of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose if
installation of manufacture homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park,
even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the
roadways are dedicated to the local government authority. "Manufactured home
park" does not include any tract of land used solely for the storage or display
for manufactured homes.
   (dd)   "Moderate wave action area (MoWA)." A special flood hazard area
subject to the potential for breaking wave heights of greater than or equal to
1.5 feet, but less than three feet, where the primary source of flooding is
storm surges, seiches. A MoWA is an area within Zone VE and a limit of moderate
wave action, where identified. (Also known as "Coastal A Zone").
   (ee)   "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)." The NFIP is a federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the federal government that states is a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (ff)   "New construction." Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by
Perry Village and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For
the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial Perry
Village Flood Insurance Rate Map, and includes any subsequent improvements to

professional surveyor under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (kk)   "Registered professional surveyor." A person registered as a
professional surveyor pursuant R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ll)   "Special flood hazard area." Also known as "areas of special flood
hazard," it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent chance of
flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood
insurance studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary
maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, A99, V, or VE. Special flood hazard areas
may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data, including, but not limited to, historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previously fold inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (mm)   "Start of construction." The date the building permit was issued,
provided that actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory building, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (nn)   "Structure." A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.

whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (pp)   "Substantial improvement." Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term include structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (qq)   "Variance." A grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations.
   (rr)   "Violation." The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

such as labeling or plan metric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation in writing by the Mayor of Perry Village,
and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of Perry
Village have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority
over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain
management regulations for a particular area. In order that Perry Village's
flood insurance rate map accurately represent Perry Village boundaries, include
within such notification a copy of a map of Perry Village suitable for
reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for
which Perry Village has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.

floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section 1309.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (4)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction. Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM, subject to the following restrictions:
         A.   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety and property of their citizens are protected.
         B.   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not be
used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or until
all appeals have been resolved.
      (2)   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section 4.9(B) since the
data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the best data available.
   (c)   Zones B, C and X: Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM
or FIS are not required for areas designated as Zone B, C or X on the effective
FIRM which are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, AO, VE, or V1-30.

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Paragraphs (i)(l)B., items 1. through 3. and 5. hereof.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,

Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the
flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain Administrator
may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with Perry Village
specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required, it
shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1309.03 (j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.

of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee in the amount of thirty-five dollars ($35.00).
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty days after the receipt of an application
for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the public hearing,
a notice of such hearing shall be given in a newspaper of general circulation
in the community at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing. At such public hearing, the applicant shall present
such statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (5)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (6)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1309.05 (d)(3)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Appeals Board, but including all documents
presented and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued within a reasonable
time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in R.C. Chapter 2506.

constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered

applicable regulations which may apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1309.03 (i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be in
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall
give notice of such violation to the person responsible therefore and order
compliance with these regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice and
order shall:
      (1)   Be put in wiring on an appropriate form;

      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this

occupant, or agent if a copy thereof is sent by registered or certified mail to
the person's last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/
or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be strict liability offense and shall constitute an unclassified
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined an amount not to
exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00). Each day such violation continues shall
be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent Perry
Village from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation. Perry Village shall prosecute any violation.
