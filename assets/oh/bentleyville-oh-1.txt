EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from
2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in
October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio Legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.
   There are no sections in Chapter 204. This chapter has been established to
provide a place for cross references and any future legislation.

208.04   PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY.
   It is the policy of the Village of Bentleyville that openness leads to a
better informed citizenry, which leads to better government and better public
policy. It is the policy of the Village of Bentleyville to strictly adhere to
the state's Public Records Act. All exemptions to openness are to be construed
in their narrowest sense and any denial of public records in response to a
valid request must be accompanied by an explanation, including legal authority,
as outlined in the Ohio Revised Code. To facilitate this policy and to oversee
compliance with the ORC, Council appoints its Fiscal Officer as Records
Custodian for all legislative-related records and requires the Mayor to
designate and identify an employee in the Administration as Records Custodian
and Coordinator for all administrative departments.
   (a)   Public records.
      (1)   This Community in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, defines
records as including the following: Any document - paper, electronic
(including, but not limited to, e-mail), or other format - that is created or
received by, or comes under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents
the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or
other activities of the office. All records of the Village of Bentleyville are
public unless they are specifically exempt from disclosure under the Ohio
Revised Code. (See ORC 149.43, attached to Ordinance 2007-25 as Appendix I.)
      (2)   It is the policy of the Village of Bentleyville that, as required
by Ohio law, records will be organized and maintained so that they are readily
available for inspection and copying (See subsection (d) below for the e-mail
record policy). Record retention schedules are to be updated regularly and
posted prominently.
   (b)   Record requests. Each request for public records should be evaluated
for a response using the following guidelines:
      (1)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must contact
the requester for clarification, and should assist the requestor in revising
the request by informing the requestor of the manner in which the office keeps
its records.
      (2)   In order to enhance this community's ability to comply with the
requestor's intended request, the request may be suggested to be put in
writing, the requestor identified, and the intended use explained. However, the
requestor must be simultaneously advised that they do not have to put the
records request in writing, and do not have to provide his or her identity or
the intended use of the requested public record, if they choose not to.
      (3)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be
made available within a reasonable period of time. "Prompt" and "reasonable"
take into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the
location where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review
of the records requested.
      (4)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, etc. If fewer than
twenty pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily available in
an electronic format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should be
made as quickly as the equipment allows.
         A.   If more than twenty pages of copies are requested, an appointment
should be made with the requester on a date when the copies or computer files
can be reviewed and/or received.
         B.   All requests for public records must either be satisfied (see
subsection (4)) or be acknowledged in writing within five business days
following the office's receipt of the request. If a request is deemed
significantly beyond "routine," such as seeking a voluminous number of copies
or requiring extensive research, the acknowledgement must include the
following:
            1.   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy
the request.
            2.   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
            3.   Any items within the request that may be exempt from
disclosure.
      (5)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. If there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority.
   (c)   Costs for Public Records. Those seeking public records will be charged
only the actual cost of making copies, and will be required to pay same in
advance.
      (1)   The charge for paper copies is five cents ($0.05) per page for
requests exceeding twenty pages.
      (2)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is two
dollars ($2.00) per disc.
      (3)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
      (4)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies. If the documents
are not able to be mailed due to size or volume as delineated by U. S. Mail
regulations, the requestor must arrange for pick up at the Municipal Center
unless the requestor approves and pays for delivery via a private delivery
service.
   (d)   E-mail. Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by
the Ohio Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office.
E-mail is to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats and
should follow the same retention schedules.
      (1)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business
are subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of this
Community are instructed to retain their e-mails that relate to public business
(see subsection (a) Public Records) and to copy them to their business e-mail
accounts and/or to the office's records custodian unless otherwise exempted
under the ORC.
      (2)   The records custodian is to treat the e-mails from private accounts
as records of the public office, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining
them per established schedules and making them available for inspection and
copying in accordance with the Public Records Act.
      (3)   Voicemail is not a public record unless it is of such significance
that an employee would normally retain it to document or verify a significant
act on behalf of the public's business, and is not otherwise documented
elsewhere. In which event, the employee is recommended to transfer such voice
mail to an email storage location, or have it transcribed for the appropriate
event file, then erased.
   (e)   Failure to respond to a public records request. The Village of
Bentleyville recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of failure to
properly respond to a public records request. In addition to the distrust in
government that failure to comply may cause, the Village of Bentleyville's
failure to comply with a request may result in a court ordering the Village of
Bentleyville to comply with the law and to pay the requestor's attorneys fees
and damages.

   (a)   Every full-time employee is entitled to receive a credit of 4.6 hours
of sick leave, with pay, for each completed 80 hours of service, excluding
overtime. An employee is eligible to use sick leave upon completion of 80 hours
of service.
   (b)   An employee shall file a written request for sick leave on forms
provided by the Village. Sick leave is to be approved by the Department Head
and the Mayor. Subject to such approval, employees may use sick leave for
absence due to:
      (1)   Illness of the employee;
      (2)   Injury of the employee;
      (3)   Exposure to contagious disease which could be communicated to other

applicable pension system or an employee who dies during active service with
the municipality and has been employed with the municipality for ten or more
continuous years prior to retirement or death may receive his or her
accumulated sick leave.
   (e)   For employees hired on or before May 1, 1991, sick leave can be
accumulated up to a maximum amount of 3,000 hours for conversion upon
retirement or death. There shall be no maximum accumulation for use of sick
leave. Redemption of sick leave hours shall be at the rate of one hour of pay
for every four hours of accumulated sick leave. Said pay shall be calculated by
combining the employee's rate of pay at the time of hire with the rate of pay
at time of retirement divided by two and multiplied by his or her accumulated
sick leave hours. The maximum conversion is one-fourth of 3,000 hours or a
maximum pay equivalent of 750 hours.
   (f)   For employees hired after May 1, 1991, sick leave can be accumulated
up to a maximum of 960 hours for conversion upon retirement or death. There

accumulated sick leave at the employee's last rate of regular pay prior to such
retirement. The maximum conversion is one-fourth of 960 hours or a maximum pay
equivalent of 240 hours.

   (b)   Funeral leave is subject to approval by the Department Head and the
Mayor. Funeral leave is not deducted from the employee's accumulated sick
leave. If the full- time employee returns to work prior to the end of the three
days, the employee will not be paid for both time worked and the allowed
funeral leave.
(Ord. 2003-27. Passed 12-17-03.)

leave of absence from their respective duties for such time as they are on jury
duty, but not exceeding 15 days in any calendar year. Required jury duty beyond
15 days shall result in the employee being on unpaid leave status.
   (b)   If an employee's duty pay or compensation during such leave of absence
is less than his or her Village pay would have been for the same period, the
employee will be paid by the Village the difference in money between the
Village pay and the jury duty pay for such period.
   (c)   In order to receive any leave pay the employee must submit to the
Mayor a receipt showing the amount of the jury fee received. Time spent on jury
service will not be deducted in calculating the amount of sick leave and
vacation earned.
(Ord. 2003-27. Passed 12-17-03.)
250.12   HOSPITALIZATION.
   (a)   Every full-time employee of the Village is eligible to enroll in the

depending on his or her status. Spouses of full-time employees shall be
required to utilize the health insurance coverage including medical, dental,
vision and prescription drug coverage offered to them by their employer or
public or private retirement plan. If the spouse's employer or retirement plan
does not offer health insurance coverage, the spouse may then utilize the
Village's health care plan.
   (b)   Employees are eligible to enroll in the group hospitalization plan on
the first day of the month following the fulfilling of 30 calendar days of
employment with the Village.
   (c)   The Village Council shall determine the coverage, the plan, and

TITLE TEN - Judiciary
            Chap.
290.   Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 290
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Bentleyville has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Bentleyville ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving
moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the
corporate limits of Bentleyville, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C.
2937.08 and 2938.04. In keeping his or her docket and file, the Mayor shall be
governed by the laws pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him or her unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such
event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate
shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court
of record in Cuyahoga County (the Bedford Municipal Court) and the magistrate
shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together with a transcript of
proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance, if given, to the
court of record. However, Rule 23 (A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure
provides that in petty offense cases, where there is a right to jury trial, the
defendant shall be tried by the court unless he or she demands a jury trial.
The jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such cases, is further limited by Rule
9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if a jury demand is not made
pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his or her right to a
jury trial in writing, a Mayor may try the case only if (1) his or her
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he or she is not the chief executive and administrative
officer of the Municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition
of the Municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any Mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Bentleyville ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas," the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend or revoke the operator's commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code (DWI), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

408.03   SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Traffic Code that is substantially similar
to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or required to
suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit for a
violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other penalties
authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of time the
court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for the
violation of the provision of this Traffic Code shall not exceed the period of
suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of the
provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this Traffic Code is
substantially similar.

(ORC 4549.081(B))
414.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03   TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians
facing a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not
enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
414.04   SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
414.05   PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"don't walk," or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

432.01   DRIVING UPON RIGHT SIDE OF ROADWAY; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one- way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic-control
device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;
         C.   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the
right-hand lane to continue on the driver’s intended route.
      (2)   Nothing in division (b)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic-control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or
except as permitted under division (a)(2) of this section.
   (d)   Division (c) of this section shall not be construed as prohibiting the
crossing of the center line in making a left turn into or from an alley,
private road, or driveway.
   (e)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under R.C. §
4511.991.
(R.C. § 4511.25)
432.02   PASSING TO RIGHT WHEN PROCEEDING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.

distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be completely made
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every event, the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable, and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for the
traffic approaching from the opposite direction, before coming within two
hundred feet of any approaching vehicle.
   (b)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under R.C. §

highway, where the operator's view is obstructed within such a distance as to
create a hazard in the event traffic might approach from the opposite
direction;
      (2)   When the view is obstructed upon approaching within one hundred
feet of any bridge, viaduct, or tunnel; or
      (3)   When approaching within one hundred feet of or traversing any

   (a)   The Department of Transportation may determine those portions of any
State highway where overtaking and passing other traffic or driving to the left
of the center or center line of the roadway would be especially hazardous, and
may, by appropriate signs or markings on the highway, indicate the beginning
and end of such zones. When signs or markings are in place and clearly visible,
every operator of a vehicle shall obey the directions of the signs or markings,
notwithstanding the distances set out in Ohio R.C. 4511.30.
   (b)   Division (a) of this section does not apply when all of the following

the two-way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven in the center
lane, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway is
clearly visible and the center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance,
or when preparing for a left turn, or where the center lane is at the time
allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is
proceeding, and is posted with signs to give notice of such allocation.
      (3)   Official signs may be erected directing specified traffic to use a
designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction, regardless of the center of the roadway, or restricting
the use of a particular lane to only buses during certain hours or during all

distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under R.C. §
4511.991.
(R.C. § 4511.33)
432.09   FOLLOWING TOO CLOSELY.
   (a)   The operator of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more
closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of the
vehicle and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.
   (b)   The driver of any truck, or motor vehicle drawing another vehicle,
when traveling upon a roadway outside a business or residence district, shall

directions on each roadway entering the intersection, an approach for a left
turn shall be made in that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the
center line thereof and by passing to the right of the center line where it
enters the intersection, and, after entering the intersection, the left turn
shall be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of the center line
of the roadway being entered. Whenever practicable, the left turn shall be made
in that portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the
intersection.
      (3)   At any intersection where traffic is restricted to one direction on
one or more of the roadways, the driver of a vehicle intending to turn left at
any such intersection shall approach the intersection in the extreme left- hand
lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of the
vehicle, and, after entering the intersection, the left turn shall be made so
as to leave the intersection, as nearly as practicable, in the left hand lane
of the roadway being entered lawfully available to traffic moving in that lane.
   (b)   The Department of Transportation and local authorities may cause
markers, buttons, or signs to be placed within or adjacent to intersections,
and thereby require and direct that a different course from that specified in

(a) of this section based on a report filed under division (e)(1) of this
section does not enter a written plea of guilty and does not waive the person’s

if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with R.C. § 4511.98,
the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall impose
upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the violation
under division (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom division
(d)(1)A. of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of $150 under
division (d)(1)A. of this section and the assessment of points under division
(d)(4) of this section, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted

and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall not be required to pay the fine and shall not have the points assessed
against that offender's driver's license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (a) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a
dismissal of the charges for the violation, and the violation is a prior
offense under divisions (d)(1)B. and (d)(1)C. of this section if the offender
commits a subsequent violation or violations of division (a) of this section
within two years of the offense for which the course was completed. This

be assessed for a violation of division (a) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for purposes of enforcing this section
unless the officer visually observes the operator using, holding, or physically
supporting with any part of the person's body the electronic wireless
communications device.

or (a)(2) and a violation of division (b)(1), (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section,
but the person may not be convicted of more than one violation of these
divisions.
   (d)   Evidence; tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine or
other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician,
chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical test
or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and (d)(4)C. of this section,
“National Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or (d)(4)B.2. of this section and if the testimony or
evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the
testimony or evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the
trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   Laboratory report.
      (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   Limitation of liability.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.

continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control.” Has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.
4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a

vehicular travel or parking within this municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   Tests at request of law enforcement agent. The chemical test or
tests under division (g)(2) of this section shall be administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the
person was operating or in physical control of a vehicle in violation of a
division, section or ordinance identified in division (g)(2) of this section.
The law enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate
which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(c),
(G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.

made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
      “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
      “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
      (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) “If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
      “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law

enforcement agency that employs the officer within twenty-four hours after the
person is given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the
officer’s employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to

that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within forty-eight hours after the
arrest of the person, a sworn report that includes all of the following
statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless

alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first-class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than fourteen days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may
give an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
provided the report is complete when given to the arrested person and
subsequently is sworn to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not

officer shall send a copy of the sworn report to the court in which the
arrested person is to appear on the charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.

driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person’s being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the person’s arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (h)(1)B., (h)(1)C., (h)
(1)D. or (h)(1)E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of

      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver’s or occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19 as a result of the

within sixty days of sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the term, the offender will not be able
to begin serving that term within the sixty-day period following the date of
sentencing, the court may impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio
R.C. 4511.19(G)(3) that includes a term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic
monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by Ohio
R.C. 4511.19(G)(1), the court may sentence the offender as provided in Ohio

permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended under division (h) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G) and if Ohio R.C. 4510.13 permits the court
to grant limited driving privileges, the court may grant the limited driving
privileges in accordance with that section. If division (A)(7) of that section
requires the court impose as a condition of the privileges that the offender
must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in

addition to or independent of any other penalty established by law, the court
may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of
the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so
imposed shall be distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that
section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, the court, in addition to any

thousand dollars ($5,000) for any economic loss arising from an accident or

Whoever violates division (b) of this section is guilty of operating a motor
vehicle after underage alcohol consumption and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (i)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. In addition to
any other sanction imposed for the offense, the court shall impose a class six
suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license or nonresident operating
privilege from the range specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(6). The court may
grant limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under R.C. §§
4510.021 and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an
ignition interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period
of suspension as authorized under R.C. § 4510.022. If the court grants
unlimited driving privileges under R.C. § 4510.022, the court shall suspend any
jail term imposed under division (i)(1) of this section as required under that

Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
      (2)   An offender who stays in a drivers’ intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay

driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended
under this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of
the person’s trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay the operation
of the suspension.
   (l)   Exception; direction of health professional. Division (a)(1)J. of this
section does not apply to a person who operates a vehicle while the person has
a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a

prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
      (2)   The person injected, ingested or inhaled the controlled substance
in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (m)   Applicability to Ohio R.C. 2923.16(D). The prohibited concentrations
of a controlled substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance listed in
division (a)(1)J. of this section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.16(D) in the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted
for a prohibited concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   Applicability of terms. All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply
to this section. If the meaning of a term defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01
conflicts with the meaning of the same term as defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01 or
4511.01, the term as defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 applies to this section.

officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible and generally acceptable field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including

court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (o)(3)A. of this section.
      (4)   Penalty. Whoever violates this division (o) is guilty of having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. In addition to other sanctions imposed, the court may impose on

commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license
or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in Ohio R.C.
4510.02(A)(7).

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.

violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver's
or commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and Social Security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Section
698.02, Section
698.03 or Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Section
698.02(d) or Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding Section
698.02(f)(1)B.1. and Ohio R.C. 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up
to one thousand dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding Section
698.02(e)(1)C. and Ohio R.C. 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered
pursuant to Section
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up
to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of
this section or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under division (c)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's
driver license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02 (A)(7).

         A.   A mandatory jail term of thirty consecutive days. Notwithstanding
the jail terms provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, the court may sentence

with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within sixty days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding
on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the sixty-day period following the date
of sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that
period.

shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a

the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an

elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff's failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined

440.01   LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with R.C. §§ 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under R.C. § 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed a
nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(R.C. § 4513.34)
   (b)   Local Streets. No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified in Section
440.02 or exceeding a gross weight of four tons, upon any street in the
Municipality, except when such operation is necessary to load or unload
property or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through or storage in the Municipality. Nothing in this section shall prevent
the Municipality from imposing stricter weight limits when it is in the public
interest to do so.
(Adopting Ordinance)
   (c)   Local Permit and Conditions.
      (1)   Upon application and for good cause, the Police Chief may issue a
local permit authorizing an applicant to move an oversize or overweight vehicle
or combination of vehicles upon local streets and highways.
      (2)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon State routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (3)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his
discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction project.
The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of operation for
such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed
or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the preservation of the
public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief may require the
posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a
roadway or road structure.
      (4)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the
Police Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant
shall pay the sum of twenty dollars ($20.00), plus the costs of any ancillary
engineering or other services deemed necessary or appropriate by the Police
Chief.
      (5)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating "no thru trucks -
gross weight 4 tons" or words of similar import to apprise drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (6)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections 408.01 and 408.02.
(Ord. 1993-32. Passed 7-14-93.)

452.05   WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief's territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper,
upon notification to the chief of such action and of the location of the place
of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, including an abandoned
junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief's or trooper's duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief
of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when such
a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered into
storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief or state highway patrol trooper shall allow
the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal
of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief or state
highway patrol trooper. If the chief or state highway patrol trooper determines
that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of time, the
chief or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the chief shall designate
the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
division (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by
a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity of
the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner's or lienholder's last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, "personal items"
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief's records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the presentation, shall issue a salvage
certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer's or facility's own name if the vehicle is

purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief of
a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation of the reason for leaving
the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor

         C.   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of

   (h)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a

452.055   PARKING PROHIBITIONS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY; PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected, may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle
only in accordance with division (d) of this section.
      (4)   As used in this section, “private residential property” means
private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than
three separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The
phrase does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (b)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been
ordered into storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section arrives after
the motor vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual
removal from the property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator
oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders
into storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section. The record shall
include an entry for each such motor vehicle that identifies the motor
vehicle's license number, make, model, and color, the location from which it
was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief's order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (a)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both of
the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 or, if the vehicle
was towed within a municipal corporation that has established fees for vehicle
removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
R.C. § 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under division
(d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Sheriff or Chief of Police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
      (4)   For purposes of division (d)(3) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (5)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
division (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for 30 days, the
procedures established by R.C. §§ 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor
vehicle from any private residential or private agricultural property other
than in accordance with division (a)(1) of this section or R.C. §§ 4513.61 to
4513.65.
      (2)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with the
requirements of this section.
   (f)   This section does not apply to any private residential or private
agricultural property that is established as a private tow-away zone in
accordance with division (h) of this section or R.C. § 4513.601.
   (g)   Whoever violates division (e) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.60)
   (h)   Private Tow-away Zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
            2.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.
If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow- away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
            3.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times,
the times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
            4.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
            5.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in R.C. § 4505.101(B).
            6.   In order to comply with the requirements of division (h)(1)A.
of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
         B.   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this division
(h) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with
all of the following:
            1.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.
            2.   It is well-lighted.
            3.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly
scheduled route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public

as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this division (h). The vehicle owner and
the operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in R.C. § 4505.101. The owner or lienholder of a vehicle
that has been removed under this division (h), subject to division (h)(3) of
this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with division (h)(7) of
this section.
         B.   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to division (h)(2) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
         C.   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (h)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.
Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
      (4)   A.   Prior to towing a vehicle under division (h)(2) of this
section, a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many
photographs as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on
private property in violation of a private tow-away zone established under
division (h)(1) of this section. The towing service shall record the time and
date of the photographs taken under this division (h). The towing service shall
retain the photographs and the record of the time and date, in electronic or
printed form, for at least 30 days after the date on which the vehicle is
recovered by the owner or lienholder or at least two years after the date on
which the vehicle was towed, whichever is earlier.
         B   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under division (h)
(2) of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more
than two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone,
unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two
hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is
not within the power of the towing service.
      (5)   A.   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with division (H)(1) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under division
(H)(2) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of removing the
vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation concerning all of the following:
            1.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model, and color;
            2.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
            3.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;

corporation shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed from private
property in the chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a private tow-away
zone of which the chief has received notice under this division (h). The record
shall include all information submitted by the towing service. The chief shall
provide any information in the record that pertains to a particular vehicle to
a person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner, operator, or lienholder of the vehicle and requests information
pertaining to the vehicle.
      (6)   A.   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this division (h), within three business days of the removal, the towing
service or storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause
a search to be made of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain
the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle. The
Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall ensure that such information is provided in a
timely manner. Subject to division (h)(6)D. of this section, the towing service
or storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
            1.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor
Vehicles provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor
vehicle, if the vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner’s and lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested or by
a commercial carrier service utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed

possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under R.C. §
4505.101(B), may initiate the process for obtaining a certificate of title to
the motor vehicle as provided in that section.

signed receipt of notice, or a notification that delivery was not possible,
shall not obtain, and shall not attempt to obtain, a certificate of title to
the motor vehicle under R.C. § 4505.101(B).

under R.C. § 4513.611.

606.02   CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for that element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for that element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for that
element.

boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this Municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this Municipality and another jurisdiction is

of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,

took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03

conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.
         (R.C. § 2901.13)
606.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Culpability." Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   "Intoxication." Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.

unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   "Possession." A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.

or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.

   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio

if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:

in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;

or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.

any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.

whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity

offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).

prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.

   (k)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of

filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, Ohio R.C. 955.11
(D) and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and
the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog,
and Section
618.17 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and

chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,

attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

under this section or any other section of the Ohio Revised Code may be
prosecuted under this section, the other section of the Ohio Revised Code, or
both sections. However, if an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of this section and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of R.C. § 2903.13, or any substantially similar municipal ordinance,
based on the same conduct involving the same victim that was the basis of the

to a court order or as specifically authorized by division (c) of this section
or another section of these Codified Ordinances or the Ohio Revised Code.
      (5)   Nothing in this division (b) or division (c) of this section
relieves a seller or an agent or employee of a seller of any responsibility to
comply with any other applicable local, state or federal laws or rules
governing the sale, giving away or other distribution of cigarettes, other
tobacco products, or alternative nicotine products.

seller, agent or employee raises and proves as an affirmative defense that all
of the following occurred:
         A.   A card holder attempting to purchase or receive cigarettes, other
tobacco products, or alternative nicotine products presented a driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or an identification card.
         B.   A transaction scan of the driver’s or commercial driver’s license

      (2)   In determining whether a seller or an agent or employee of a seller
has proven the affirmative defense provided by division (c)(1) of this section,
the trier of fact in the action for the alleged violation of division (a) of
this section shall consider any written policy that the seller has adopted and
implemented and that is intended to prevent violations of division (a) of this
section. For purposes of division (c)(1)C. of this section, the trier of fact
shall consider that reasonable reliance upon the identification presented and
the completed transaction scan may require a seller or an agent or employee of
a seller to exercise reasonable diligence to determine, and that the use of a
transaction scan device does not excuse a seller or an agent or employee of a
seller from exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:
         A.   Whether a person to whom the seller or agent or employee of a
seller sells, gives away or otherwise distributes cigarettes, other tobacco
products, or alternative nicotine products is 21 years of age or older;

issuance in lieu of the testimony of the personnel of or contractors with the

offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially similar municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially similar municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially similar municipal ordinance to any of these offenses,
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried

of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

642.25   DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
642.09:
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2913.61.
   (c)   Prima facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Ohio
R.C. 2913.61(D), may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to
this section.

that involves alleged tampering with a gas, electric, steam or water meter,
conduit or attachment of a utility that has been disconnected by the utility,
proof that a meter, conduit or attachment of a utility has been tampered with
is prima facie evidence that the person who is obligated to pay for the service
rendered through the meter, conduit or attachment, and who is in possession or
control of the meter, conduit or attachment at the time the tampering occurred
has caused the tampering with intent to commit a theft offense.
   (b)   In a prosecution for a theft offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2913.01,
that involves the alleged reconnection of a gas, electric, steam or water
meter, conduit or attachment of a utility that has been disconnected by the

the time of the reconnection has reconnected the meter, conduit or attachment
with intent to commit a theft offense.

      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality.
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

698.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Dangerous offender" means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   "Repeat offender" means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(ORC 2935.36(E)) (Ord. 1996-22. Passed 8-21-96.)
698.02   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) to (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than sixty days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than
one- hundred twenty days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least thirty days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
         (R.C. § 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in Ohio R.C.
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)C. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender' occupation or care
for the offender' family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring

         C.   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor of
the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or fourth

         G.   A term of monitored time;
         H.   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug

         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender's motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially similar municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially similar
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially similar municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially similar municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
         (R.C. § 2929.28)
698.03   IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)(2)B.
and C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim's representative, the victim's
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
         (R.C. 2929.22) (Ord. 1996-22. Passed 8-21-96.)
698.04   ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00);
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31) (Ord. 1996-22. Passed 8-21-96.)
698.05   MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a
prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

698.06   MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section
698.06 was repealed as part of the 2003 updating and revision of these Codified
Ordinances because substantially identical State law (Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was

698.07   SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially similar.

owner, partner or principal corporate officer, has:
      (1)   Committed any act which, if committed by a licensee, would be
grounds for revocation of a license under subsection (h) hereof;

regulation of the Alarm Administrator, which violation the Alarm Administrator
determines to reflect unfavorably upon the fitness of the licensee to engage in
the alarm business;

nature in connection with an application for a license or a renewal or
reinstatement of a license or in a notice or transfer of an alarm business

the Alarm Administrator determines that such conviction reflects unfavorably on

application for a license.

assigned or transferred either by law or otherwise.
(Ord. 1989-29. Passed 7-12-89.)

   A permit for the installation of a local alarm which, when activated, sounds
a horn, bell, buzzer or other type of audible alarm, shall be required if the

further, that the alarm is equipped with an automatic reset device which resets
the alarm within fifteen minutes, and the permit holder provides the names,
addresses and telephone numbers of three persons who will respond when called

permit for the alarm with which the false alarm is associated.
   (c   Notwithstanding the fee to be assessed, as set forth above, no charge
shall be made for the first three false alarms in any calendar year, for a
false alarm to which there is no response by the Police Department, nor when
the cause has been proven to be an act of God.
   (d)   A grace period of thirty days from the date of installation shall be
granted to new permit holders. During this period, no false alarms shall be
counted towards the three false alarms that are allowed before charges are
assessed.

from whatever source, shall provide a written report to the Chief of Police
within three working days as to the nature of the program and the exact service
rendered.

or his or her representative may require that repairs be made whenever he or
she has determined that such are necessary to assure proper operation.
   (e)   All alarms installed in the Village must be provided with an auxiliary
power source to preclude false alarms due to power failures in the normal power

   It is the intent of Council to ensure the safe operation of oil and gas
wells within the Municipality. Toward that end, this chapter has been adopted
to supplement any State issued permits which authorize the drilling of an oil
and gas well within the Municipality. The provisions of this chapter arc based
upon local conditions which may not be known to the State at the time such
drilling was authorized. It is, further, the intent of the Municipality to
exercise its local police authority, authorized under Article XVUI, Section 3
of the Ohio Constitution, to the fullest extent permitted by law for the
protection of the Municipality's residents and all emergency personnel who may
be called upon to respond to an incident at an oil and gas well.

850.02   INTERPRETATION.
   If any provision of this chapter is deemed to conflict with any
constitutional general law of the State of Ohio, the general law shall prevail.
In the event the general law of the State is silent as to any substantive
regulation contained herein, the substantive regulation established by this
chapter shall be applicable.
(Ord. 2007-08. Passed 4-18-07.)

Chief, Zoning Inspector, and Village Engineer shall receive and respond in
writing to permit notices from ODNR. They will participate in pre-construction

shall adhere to the following regulations:
   (a)   A copy of the state issued permit shall be filed with the Police Chief
not less than ten days before the commencement of any operations preparatory to
drilling in the Village. Upon receipt by the Chief, a copy of such permit shall
be delivered by the Village to all owners and/or occupants of all properties
which adjoin the property where a well is to be drilled.
   (b)   With a copy of the permit, a letter will be filed with the Chief which

reasonable access to the site.
   (f)   No well is allowed to be drilled within any distance of any structure
or facility (e.g. a park) which, based upon the specific facts and
circumstances surrounding such structure or facility, creates a threat to the
health, safety and welfare of said structure or facilities or occupants or
users thereof.
   (g)   Proof of insurance shall be filed with the Chief prior to the
commencement of drilling. The proof of insurance must establish that the permit

immediately advise the permit holder if anything shown on the plans does not
comply with the regulations set forth herein. In the event that any permit
holder fails to comply with the regulations herein promulgated, the
administrative official responsible for the enforcement hereof (i.e. the
Building Commissioner or Police Chief, as designated herein), shall provide
written notice to the owner of the property and the permit holder within forty-
eight hours of the discovery of such failure to comply. Such service shall be
made to the addresses identified in paragraph (b) hereof, and if no address has
been provided to any address identified on the permit issued by the State of
Ohio. The notice shall advise the owner and the permit holder that if they wish
to appeal the decision of the administrative official, the time for appeal is
five days after service of the notice.
(Ord. 2007-08. Passed 4-18-07.)
850.05   APPEAL.

regulations promulgated hereunder, which is adverse to the rights of any owner
of property or any permit holder may be appealed to the Planning and Zoning

unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this chapter
that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable context
in both the laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax and in

laws of the United States relating to Federal income tax shall control over the
use of the term in R.C. Title LVII.

Federal taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as
determined under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:

         B.   Add an amount equal to five percent of intangible income deducted
under division (c)(1)A. of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition

municipal taxable income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net
operating loss carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years
following the taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for

for all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the
Village on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if the Tax
Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in the
Village for all or part of the taxable year.
         B.   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (e)(1)A. of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Village for all or part of the taxable year.
      (2)   For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled

to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         I.   The number of contact periods the individual has with the
Village. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one contact
period with the Village if the individual is away overnight from the
individual's abode located outside of the Village and while away overnight from
that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the Village.
      (3)   All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.
Businesses.
   (f)   This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the Village, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in
the Village or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under R.C.
Chapter 5745.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
         A.   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
               As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such properly shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during

taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
890.04(c);
         C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the Village to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   A.   If the apportionment factors described in division (f)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of
the Village may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
890.12(a).
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (f)(2)A. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
890.12(a).
         D.   Nothing in division (f)(2) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (f)(1)B. of this section, wages, salaries, and
other compensation includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid to
an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         A.   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;

customer, client, or patient.
         B.   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (f)(3)A. or B. of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (f)(1)C. of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
         A.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in the Village if,

criteria:
            1.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village
from a stock of goods located within the Village.
            2.   The property is delivered within the Village from a location
outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            3.   The property is shipped from a place within the Village to
purchasers outside the Village, provided that the taxpayer is not, through its
own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at
the place where delivery is made.
         B.   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.

royalties from real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village.
         E.   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Village’s tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Village or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the Village.
The Village shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for
the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Village, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
Village to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real
estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of the Village shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the Village. The individual may claim a credit for taxes
the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under the Village’s income tax ordinance.
      (7)   When calculating the ratios described in division (f)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (f)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

Withholding Provisions.
   (a)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the Village shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the Village. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
890.03 or division (b)(4) or (b)(6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld
at the rate, specified in Section
890.01(b)(1), of 1.0 percent. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the
employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays
the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Village the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         A.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Village in the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand
three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Village in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two hundred
dollars ($200.00).
               Payment under division (b)(1)A. of this section shall be made so
that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days
after the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         B.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)A. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
         C.   [Intentionally left blank.]
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying Federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other Federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Village as the return
required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         A.   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Village during the preceding calendar year;
         B.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         C.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         D.   Any other information required for Federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         E.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

         C.   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report

               If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the greatest number of days in a calendar year performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (c)(2)A.1. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
               For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with
division (c)(2)B. of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted

this section, an employer is not required to withhold the Village income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the Village if the employee performed such services in the Village on 20 or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Village.
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Village. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
Village at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to

that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in this section.
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         B.   For the purposes of division (c)(2)A. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Village than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to

            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (c)(2)A. of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)B. of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to the Village for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the Village.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
under division (c)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
Village for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to
the employee for personal services performed in the Village.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the Village and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
890.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the Village.
            To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for
a taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator
with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (c)(2)A. and (c)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of this section.

tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these

retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
   (b)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,

corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and, with
respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to support

      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit

municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.

required to be filed under this section shall be completed and filed as
required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed for the

return. The extended due date of the Village’s income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
         A.   A copy of the Federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Village’s income tax return.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's Village income tax return. If the request is received by
the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Village income tax return is
due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
Village’s income tax return. The extended due date of the Village’s income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)   To the extent that any provision in this division (g) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) prevail.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village for a taxable
year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the Village an
annual net profit return under division (f)(3) of this section.
   (i)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under Section
890.04(b)(1)A. or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (j)   Taxes withheld for the Village by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
890.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Village, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the Village and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Village to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Village, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the
Village or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
chapter and of the Village’s ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (m)   (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the
Village’s income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for Service in or for the Armed Forces.
   (n)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the Village
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by the Village during the period of the member's
or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (o)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Village before the 181st day after the applicant's active
duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (o)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (p)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (n) and (o) of this section.
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Village in accordance with
this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (p)(2)A. of
this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that
the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a
member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called
to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         B.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (p)
(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (q)   For each taxable year to which division (n), (o), or (p) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (o)(2) and (o)(3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated Municipal Income Tax Return.
   (r)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.

Internal Revenue Code.

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
Federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.

§ 5727.01.
   (s)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village’s
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under Federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (s)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (s)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (s)(1) or (s)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (t)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated
Village income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated Village
income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer
requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a
separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (u)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Village income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
Federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (v)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (v)(2), (v)(3), and
(v)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income
tax return shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section
890.02, by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income" for "Federal
taxable income" wherever "Federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
890.02(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80 percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall do one of the
following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80 percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the Village.
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)   Corporations filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (r) through (y) of this section
by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to" for "net
profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (x)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the Village in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   (a)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Village who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter, may claim a
nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this chapter upon satisfactory
evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality. Subject to division
(c) of this section, the credit shall not exceed .125 percent of the amount
obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying wages, commissions, net profits
or other compensation subject to tax in the other municipality by the LOWER of
the tax rate in such other municipality OR the tax rate imposed under this
chapter.
   (b)   The Village shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Village who works in a joint economic development zone created
under R.C. § 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
R.C. § 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax
in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by dividing
the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for that
municipality.
   (d)   [Intentionally left blank.]

taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (b)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for

         A.   Taxes withheld for the Village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Village in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, "date of
the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the

date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under Section
890.05(g) or on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the taxpayer

fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 22.5 percent of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the 15th day of the sixth month after the beginning

   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
890.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5 percent
of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for
that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45 percent
of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for
that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5 percent
of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for
that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90 percent
of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for
that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90
percent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
Village under Section
890.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

(Ord. 2015-29. Passed 9-16-15.)
890.09   REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section

   (b)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax

Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (c)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
890.21.
   (d)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the

any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
890.18(a)(4).

withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (c)   If the Village’s tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Village’s tax rate. However, if-the Village’s tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to the Village, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carry forward.

Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or state income tax return only:
         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
890.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by Section
890.12(e) for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is in accordance with the dollars,
no refund need be paid by the Village. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's Federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
890.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any Federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to the
Village income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Village income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).

890.12   LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
890.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the 60th day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the 60th day after
the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is either
ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no further
appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that reversal is
available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25 percent or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
890.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
890.09, with interest on that amount as provided by Section
890.09(e).
   (e)   No civil action to recover the Village income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 2015-29. Passed 9-16-15.)
890.13   AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
      A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer's attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
      This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is
not an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2015-29. Passed 9-16-15.)
890.14   SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to
deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-
delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056. If
the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment's postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other Village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
         "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
            Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
            If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)
(1)A. of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-29. Passed 9-16-15.)
890.15   ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village that arises pursuant to the Village’s income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the Village:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-29. Passed 9-16-15.)
890.16   TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the Village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-29. Passed 9-16-15.)
890.17   FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Village ordinance or state law
to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Village or the Tax Administrator.

      (5)   "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation, schedule,
and other document required to be filed with the Tax Administrator or the
Village by a taxpayer, employer, any agent of the employer, or any other payer
pursuant to applicable law, including at any time before January 1, 2016.

      (9)   "Withholding tax" includes amounts an employer, any agent of an

   (b)   (1)   This section applies to the following:
         A.   Any return required to be filed under applicable law for taxable
years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         B.   Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required to
be paid or remitted to the Village on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the Village to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (c)   Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer
for any reason fails, in whole or in part, to make timely and full payment or
remittance of income tax, estimated income tax, or withholding tax or to file
timely with the Village any return required to be filed, the following

890.19   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (a)   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the Ohio Revised Code:
      (1)   A.   Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as provided
by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and Federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.

the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the Village’s
income tax ordinance;

      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

may examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the Village or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and Federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
Identification Information.
   (c)   (1)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, Federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
890.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
890.99.
         B.   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (c) of this section
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
890.18.
         C.   The penalties provided for under divisions (c)(2)A. and B. of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
890.99 for a violation of Section
890.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

   (c)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (d)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.
   (e)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (f)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.
(Ord. 2015-29. Passed 9-16-15.)

such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Village at any time during their term or in the five years (which applies
only to these two appointments) immediately preceding the date of appointment.

remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.

Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the

shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the

appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.

days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in R.C. § 5717.011.
   (f)   The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under R.C. §

pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body subject to R.C. §
121.22.

1020.01   DEDICATION OF UNDEDICATED STREETS.
   (a)   Legislation accepting the dedication of undedicated streets shall not
be enacted until a subdivider files a plat "for record purposes only" and until
the construction bond is released and an applicable maintenance bond is posted.
During the period of the maintenance bond, the Village shall be responsible to
see that the street is kept in good repair. Prior to the release of such
maintenance bond a final inspection shall be made by the Village Engineer.
During the period of the bond, any maintenance costs expended by the Village
shall be reimbursed from the bond. Snow removal shall commence along all
streets along which dwelling structures have been completed.
   (b)   At the end of the maintenance bond period the street shall be eligible
for full acceptance by the Village for full maintenance and snow removal,
provided that:
      (1)   Not more than ten percent of all lots (or the nearest greater full
number of lots), with sole access from the street, have dwelling structures
that are not complete, that have not passed final inspection and that have not
had certificates of occupancy issued therefor.
      (2)   A separate agreement shall be signed by the home/lot owner,
homeowners' association or other entity who or which owns the land under the
street, to undertake the responsibility of maintenance and repair in futuro of
any and all storm sewers already installed under the right of way at the time
of the proposed dedication. Said obligation shall include any storm sewer
originating or terminating at any point outside the right of way, but crossing
within it.
      (3)   Prior to acceptance of any street proposed to be dedicated, all
existing storm sewers shall, at the instance of the Village, but at the expense
of the owner, be video inspected, and any repairs or maintenance necessary, in
the sole discretion of the Village, shall be completed prior to any such
acceptance of dedication.
      (4)   Subsequent to the acceptance of dedication of any street by the
Village, the Village shall retain the authority to inspect existing storm
sewers at such times as in its sole discretion it deems necessary and shall
order the owner to perform such repairs and/or maintenance as the Village
shall, in its sole discretion, find and deem necessary, all upon reasonable
written notice to such owner. If such owner does not complete any maintenance
or repair work within a reasonable time, the Village may, upon reasonable
written notice to such owner, cause such maintenance and/or repair work to be
performed and recover the cost of the same from such owner by virtue of any
available legal remedy, including certifying the cost of the same to the County
Auditor for collection on such owner's real estate tax obligation.
      (5)   The Village shall be responsible for the maintenance and repair of
any and all storm water culverts which originate or terminate at a point out of
the right of way, but which cross the right of way, including pass through and
roadway drainage culverts.
      (6)   The owner shall be responsible for the repair and maintenance of
any and all driveway culverts and parallel drainage ditches and culverts. The
Village shall retain the authority to inspect such sewers at such times as in
its sole discretion it deems necessary and shall order such owner to perform
such repairs and/or maintenance as the Village shall, in its sole discretion,
find and deem necessary, all upon reasonable written notice to such owner. If
such owner does not complete any maintenance or repair work within a reasonable
time, the Village may, upon reasonable written notice to such owner, cause such
maintenance and/or repair work to be performed and recover the cost of the same
from such owner by virtue of any available legal remedy, including certifying
the cost of the same to the County Auditor for collection on such owner's real
estate tax obligation.
(Ord. 1993-49. Passed 3-9-94.)
1020.02   ROAD DAMAGE FEE.
   (a)   Before any person is granted a permit for the construction,
enlargement, alteration, repair or removal of any dwelling, building or other
structure which may result in damage to a municipal street, highway, sidewalk,
tree lawn, gutter or utility, each person shall be required to pay a road
damage fee as specified in
Chapter 1428 of these Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   If the fee paid is insufficient to reimburse the municipality for
damage actually caused, the Village Treasurer may take the necessary steps to
affect the collection of the remainder of the costs from the person or entity
which caused the damage.
   (c)   The Planning Commission, upon application and for good cause shown,
may reduce or waive the road damage fee to avoid an unjust or inequitable
result.
   (d)   The Village shall deposit all fees collected pursuant to this section
in the Village's Street Fund, and such fee shall be used for repair of the
Village's roads and appurtenances, and for no other purpose.

1024.01   DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter certain words shall be defined as follows:
   (a)   "Company" means any public utility corporation, person, firm, company,
political subdivision or corporation, whether municipal or otherwise, doing
construction or maintenance work on structures located in, under or over the
streets or public grounds of the Village.
   (b)   "Cost" means the entire cost of work and materials and includes all
incidental expense, such as repaving, Village inspection and supervision,
pertaining to the construction or maintenance of any structure.
   (c)   "Structure" means any pipe, conduit or duct line, sewer, water main,
service connection, pole, wire, track or other structure or appurtenance,
located in, under or over the streets or public grounds.
   (d)   "Village" means the Village of Bentleyville, a municipal corporation,
acting in an administrative capacity by its Mayor and duly appointed officers,
within the scope of their authority, and in a legislative capacity by Village
Council.
   (e)   "Work" means any and all labor and materials, delivery of materials,
supervision, fabrication or process of construction pertaining to the
construction or maintenance of any structure.
(Ord. 2005-12. Passed 5-24-05.)
1024.02   PRIORITIES.
   (a)   The Village, in the construction, reconstruction and maintenance of
Village structures, shall have prior right in or over the streets or public
grounds and may require the removal, relocation, reconstruction or support of
the structures of any company. In such cases, the entire cost of such removal,
relocation, construction or support shall be borne by the company.
   (b)   The Village, if deemed necessary and in the public interest, may
require the removal, relocation, reconstruction or support of the structures of
any company for the purpose of permitting the construction, reconstruction or
maintenance of the structures of a second company and the cost thereof shall be
borne by the second company. However, if it is determined that the structures
of the prior company were constructed without authorization or permit of the
Village, are not located substantially in accordance with the plans filed
therefor, occupy an unnecessary or unreasonable proportion of the space
available, or for other just and reasonable cause, the Village may require that
the cost of such removal, relocation, reconstruction or support shall be borne
all or in part of such prior company.
(Ord. 2005-12. Passed 5-24-05.)
1024.03   WORK ON OR UNDER PUBLIC WAYS OR GROUNDS; PERMITS REQUIRED.
   No construction, reconstruction or maintenance work shall be done in, over
or under dedicated right-of-way on streets or public grounds by any company
until satisfactory plans therefor have been filed with and approved by the
Village and written permits for such work are issued. Any material alternations
or additions to the work must be approved by the Village and written permits
secured. Where a street pavement or sidewalk is to be opened for any work, a
street opening permit shall be included in those to be secured, and where a
sidewalk or drive is to be replaced in connection with the work, a sidewalk
permit shall be secured. After the completion of work, the company shall, if
necessary, revise or file amended plans so that the final record on file with
the Village shall show the correct location, size and extent of all structures
constructed, relocated or removed or which otherwise are not in accord with the
records prior to such work. The foregoing provisions of this section shall not
apply to emergency work made necessary by accidents or other unforeseen
conditions requiring immediate action to prevent damage to persons or property,
but the company shall promptly report the nature and extent of any such work to
the Village, shall secure the written approval of work which has been done and
shall deposit the estimated cost of inspection, supervision, refilling,
repairing, repaving, etc., as required by this chapter.
(Ord. 2005-12. Passed 5-24-05.)
1024.04   PLANNING REQUIREMENTS.
   The plans for the work or structures of any company in the streets or public
grounds shall show by scale of sufficient size to determine locations within
one foot or by dimensions, the accurate location, size and depth of structures
proposed to be built in relation to street lines and grade or monuments or to
semipermanent structures such as curbs, sidewalks or buildings. Three copies of
the plans shall be submitted to the Village Engineer for review. The Village
may require that accurate surveys be made before or during construction. Pipe
conduits, duct lines and water mains shall, in general, follow lines parallel
to street and grade lines. Sewers shall, in general, follow lines parallel with
street lines and be on a grade satisfactory to the Village. All such
construction shall be at a depth satisfactory to the Village. Such construction
shall not be so laid as to obstruct or reduce the size of any culvert, storm
sewer or similar structure. Service connections shall, in general, be laid on
lines which are radial or at right angles to street lines. Special structures
shall be detailed to the satisfaction of the Village.
(Ord. 2005-12. Passed 5-24-05.)
1024.05   SUPERVISION BY VILLAGE; DEPOSITS.
   All work done and structures built in streets and public grounds shall be
under the inspection and supervision of the Village to the extent that it may
deem necessary to protect the public interest. Before starting any work the
company shall deposit with the Village, a satisfactory amount to cover the
estimated cost of plan review inspection, supervision, restoration, refilling,
repaving, repairing and any other expenses that may be incurred by the Village
in connection with the proposed work. The Village may, from time to time,
require that additional deposits be made if it is found that the expenses
incurred will be in excess of the amount on deposit. If deposits are not made
promptly on demand of the Village, all work may be stopped by order of the
Village until such demands are satisfied and any expense occasioned by such
delay shall be borne by the company. Any balance remaining after the completion
of the work shall be refunded to the company.
(Ord. 2005-12. Passed 5-24-05.)
1024.06   WORK REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   The work of the company shall be first class in every respect. The
Village shall have the right to insist that all work be performed by competent
foremen and workmen and may require that any company employees doing
unsatisfactory work be removed. All structures shall be constructed in a
workmanlike manner, true to line, grade and dimensions, and of ample strength
to withstand all anticipated loads and streets. The Village may require that
unsatisfactory structures be rebuilt. Materials shall be entirely suitable for
the structures contemplated; they shall be so delivered and stored as to give
least inconvenience to the public and shall be used within a reasonable time
after delivery.
   (b)   Excavation for structures shall be so documented as to keep
interference with other uses of streets and public grounds to a minimum and
shall be subject to Village control as to location and extent. Suitable
temporary bridges over trenches at street intersections and at other locations
where they are deemed necessary shall be required by the Village. Excavation in
general shall be open trench and tunneling and will be permitted only in
specific locations approved by the Village. Existing utilities and structures
shall be protected and supported during work. Structures of the Village and
other companies encountered during work shall be called to the attention of the

backfill has fully settled, the temporary paving shall be removed and permanent
repairs made by the Village at the company's expense. If the deposits above
mentioned are insufficient to cover the costs, the balance shall be collected
from the company. If more has been deposited than is needed, the balance shall
be refunded to the company.
   (e)   Pavement, curbing, walks, drives and other Village structures removed
or disturbed during work shall be replaced by the Village at the expense of the
company unless otherwise provided at the time the permit is granted. If the
company is permitted to do any part of such replacement work it must be done
under Village inspection, according to pavement replacement details approved by
the Village Engineer. Pavement base shall be of at least two inches greater
thickness and two inches wider than the base removed. Concrete shall have
adequate steel reinforcement to the satisfaction of the Village. Pavement
surface shall be of the same types as the surface removed except by written
permission of the Village. In general, replaced structures shall be of greater
thickness, strength and durability than the original structures to compensate
for possible subsurface settlements, or failures, for difficulty in bonding old
and new work, and for structural weakening due to loss of homogeneity.
   (f)   Wooden poles carrying wires or cables shall be of one piece and shall
not be extended in length or height by splicing, bolting or otherwise fastening
thereto any other piece of wood or metal.
   (g)   In an emergency the Village may enter upon any work and execute such

with good standard practice and shall be liable for any damage to persons or
property occasioned by improper work, maintenance or negligence. Settlement of
pavement, walks, curb lawns or structures over or adjacent to recently
completed work will, unless satisfactory contrary evidence is presented, be
regarded as due to such work and the company responsible shall pay the cost of
any repairs or replacements that may be necessary. The Village shall order such
maintenance as is deemed necessary in the interest of public safety and in
accordance with the terms under which such structures have been erected. Upon
the failure of the company to comply with such order the Village may cause such
work to be done at the expense of the company.

1044.02   WATER LINE CHARGES FOR CANNON ROAD, SOLON ROAD, PARKWOOD CIRCLE,
CHAGRIN RIVER ROAD, OVERLOOK ROAD AND LIBERTY ROAD.
   (a)   This section applies to all properties adjoining or accessible to the
1994 water line distribution system which consists of water mains in the
following locations: Cannon Road from an existing water main at a point
approximately 170 feet easterly of Berkshire Park Drive to Solon Road, thence
in Solon Road southwesterly to an existing water main located at a point
approximately 175 feet southwesterly of the Village's southerly corporate line,
in easements of the Village in a private street designated as Parkwood Circle
from Cannon Road southerly and southwesterly approximately 1100 feet and in the
cul-de-sac of that private street, in Chagrin River Road from an existing water
main in Miles Road southerly to the Aurora Branch of the Chagrin River, from
the Aurora Branch of the Chagrin River to an existing water main in Solon Road
and from an existing water main at Holbrook Road southeasterly to the southerly
corporation line of the Village, in easements of the Village in a private
street designated as Overlook Road from Chagrin River Road northerly
approximately 910 feet, and in Liberty Road from an existing water main at a
point approximately 260 feet northerly of the southerly corporate line of the
Village to an existing water main in Solon Road.
   (b)   Except for the owners of the assessed or voluntarily paid properties,
paid or committed to be paid as of June 1, 1995, no owner of property or other
person, corporation, partnership, association or other entity, or any agent,
independent contractor, servant, lessee or tenant thereof, or occupant
(hereinafter referred to as the "applicant"), shall tap into or cause to be
tapped into the water main any residence or accessory structure, directly or
indirectly, or receive a permit to build any structure, unless the applicant
shall have first secured a permit for such purpose from the Village.
   (c)   The Village shall not issue a permit for the purpose described in
subsection (b) hereof until the applicant for the permit shall have paid to the
Village the cash amount of seven thousand and forty-five dollars ($7,045) (the
final amount assessed per benefit), plus a cash amount for interest. The
interest to be charged will be calculated at the annual rate of six percent
times the assessed amount, times the period of time (in years, plus a fraction
of a year to include month(s)) from the date of notice of the final assessment
to the date of application for the permit. This is the tap-in fee. Only one fee
need be paid for all approved buildings situated on a single building lot. The
applicant is responsible for paying the cost of the installation of the lateral
connection, which is a separate cost from the cost of the tap-in. The lateral
connection extends from the main to the right-of-way and to the point of use.
   (d)   Should any properties described in subsection (a) hereof be divided in
such a manner as to create new building lots, the fee set forth above shall be
payable for each building lot, and each lot shall be connected to a main that
is part of the original project or to a main that is to be connected to and is
to be extended from a main that is a part of the original project.
   (e)   The Village Council shall have the exclusive authority to adjust the
accumulated interest rate and/or permit fees for good cause shown and entered
in the minutes of Council.
   (f)   The permit and fee specified herein shall be in addition to payment of
the actual cost of connecting the property to the project or to an extension of
any part of the project, and in addition to payment for extending the water
main to any residence or accessory structure on the property, and in addition
to payment of any other permit or fee required by any other ordinance or
regulation of the Village, and in addition to payment of all fees to the
Cleveland Water Division, and shall not preclude any deposit or bond required
by any other ordinance or regulation to ensure that the connection to the
project shall be made in such manner as will not injure the project and as will
ensure that all streets, sidewalks and other property will be returned to the
same state as before the connection was made.
   (g)   The fees collected by the Village from issuing the permits required by
this chapter shall be delivered to the Treasurer as custodian of the funds of
the Village and shall be credited by the Treasurer to the Water Fund, to be
used as determined by Council for servicing, maintaining and/or replacing the
subject water system.
(Ord. 1994-17. Passed 7-19-95.)
1044.03   USE OF FIRE HYDRANTS; PERMIT; DEPOSIT.
   No person, other than the Fire Department, or any other official or
department of the Municipality in its official capacity, shall tap or connect
into, or use any water from, any fire hydrant within the Municipality, whether
on or along dedicated or undedicated streets or on private property, except in
the following instances:
   (a)   For the extinguishment of fires or other emergency use, under the
direction of the Fire Department;
   (b)   For use in the construction of new buildings, improvements, or filling
of pools and ponds, under authority of a permit obtained from the City of
Cleveland Water Division (Chagrin Falls water customers will not receive a
permit) and from the Building Inspector of the Municipality, who shall require
a deposit of fifty dollars ($50.00) in cash for each such permit, plus the
estimated cost of the water to be used. The Fire Department shall inspect the
hydrant after it has been so used, and, if all equipment obtained from the
Municipality for such purposes has been returned to the Municipality and if no
damage has been caused by the permit holder to the hydrants or other property
of the Municipality, the sum of ten dollars ($10.00), from the cash deposit,
shall be returned to the permit holder, and the balance of the deposit shall be
retained by the Municipality as payment for the services of the Fire Department
and the Commissioner. The cost of the water shall be fully paid by the user.
Should there be an excess on deposit, the balance will be returned. If any of
the equipment has not been returned to the Municipality, or if there has been
any damage to the hydrants or other property of the Municipality, the entire
deposit shall be retained by the Municipality, and the permit holder shall
still be liable to the Municipality for the amount of any damage caused by him
or her in excess of the amount of the deposit.
(Ord. 1995-24. Passed 6-21-95.)
1044.04   CHAGRIN PARK ESTATES TAP IN FEES.
   (a)   The Village hereby gives consent to the county to construct, within
two years from effective date of their agreement, a distribution line upon the
terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, and subject to all applicable
ordinances of the Village and all applicable provisions of Ohio Revised Code:
      (1)   The county shall have the right to use the easements, streets, and
other public ways and places in the Village to the extent the Village has such
rights, for the purpose of laying and extending said distribution line in
consideration for the right to tap into said line by the Village residents and
users.
      (2)   The county shall have the right to use, extend, tap or connect into
any and all water mains and other water transmission facilities irrespective of
whether or not they are owned or controlled by the Village, without any fee or
charges by the Village to the county for the exercise of such right.
      (3)   The county shall have the obligation to provide, at its sole cost
and expense, the planning, engineering, purchasing, construction, installation
and related activities required for the proper laying and functioning of said
distribution line.
      (4)   The Village shall cooperate with the county in the construction and
installation of said distribution line to the extent such cooperation shall not
impose any cost to the Village, and the county shall provide the Village with
due notice as to the location and time table of the construction of the
proposed distribution line. The Village shall not charge the county for any
permits in connection with such installation, and the Village shall cooperate
in providing all permits, easements, rights-of-way access, and other rights and
privileges necessary to facilitate the county's work. To the extent allowed by
law, the county shall hold the Village harmless from all damages or claims for
damages to persons or property arising from the performance by the county or
its agents of any work to install or lay said distribution line.
      (5)   The county shall comply with all City of Cleveland standards in
connection with the laying and construction of said distribution line,
including but not limited to type, grade, and quality of material, inside
diameter of said line, installation of water hydrants, extension of line across
intersection of Chagrin River and Holbrook Roads, and engineering standards. It
is understood the line will be master metered at the county's western boundary
line.
   (b)   The county shall construct said line within the territorial boundaries
of the Village at no cost or obligation, current or in the future, to the
Village. The Village recognizes that future residents in the Village who may
benefit from said line may be assessed therefore.
   (c)   The owners of any and all existing or future dwelling units in the
Village shall have the right to tap into said line, provided a tap-in fee of
one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) is paid to the county by said owner.
The number of tap-ins by Village residents permitted into said line shall be
110. Additional tap-ins will be permitted by the county under terms to be
negotiated by the county and the Village at the time. Nothing herein shall be
deemed to limit the number of tap-ins by Geauga County residents, except the
capacity of said line to provide a sufficient water supply to each owner who
taps-in to said line. Nothing herein shall be deemed to affect any owner's
obligation to pay a tap-in fee to the Village, under the terms of any existing,
amended, or future legislation requiring same, in addition to the tap-in fee to
the county set forth herein.
   In the event any political subdivision and/or Village residents desire to
extend said line southeasterly along Chagrin River Road beyond its junction
with Holbrook Road, the county agrees to permit same without the payment of any
tap-in, recoupment, or other fee or charge, provided that such extension should
not diminish the quantity or quality of water available to the county.
   (d)   In consideration of the Village entering into this agreement, the
county agrees that after the line is built, the line shall become the property
of and be owned by Cleveland after it is installed, and shall be maintained by
the City of Cleveland, as evidenced by its signature to this agreement. Failure
of the City of Cleveland to so agree and sign shall nullify this agreement.
   (e)   The county shall restore, within six months of date of completion, all
property situated in the Village, including berm and paved portions of roads,
to pre-construction conditions by reason of said construction, and also
including any damage caused by truck, equipment or other vehicular traffic
during construction. For all construction occurring within five feet of the
berm, premier fill or compacted earth to ninety-five percent standard proctor
shall be used.
   (f)   The county shall pay for inspection expenses to be performed by the
Village Engineer.
   (g)   The county shall pay for traffic control personnel during
construction, and shall give right of first refusal to members of the Village
of Bentleyville Police Department.
   (h)   The Village and the county expressly agree that the terms, covenants
and conditions made in this agreement shall bind its respective Council and
Board of Commissioners, Officers, and Mayor, and they have authority to execute
this agreement.
   (i)   If any governmental unit, department, division, body or office
referred to in this agreement shall cease to exist or shall cease to retain any
part of its powers and duties material to the performance of this agreement
which have vested in them at the time of the execution of this agreement, then
all references to them shall be deemed to include whatever governmental units,
department, division, body or office shall then succeed to or have the powers
and duties material to performance of this agreement without regard to title or
formal designation.
   (j)   No covenant, agreement, or condition of this agreement shall be
waived, altered, or modified, except by a written instrument, executed by the
party against whom enforcement of such waiver, alteration, or modification is
sought. No waiver of any covenant, term, or condition of this agreement shall
affect any other covenant, term, or condition of this agreement.
   (k)   It is expressly understood and agreed that there are no promises,
agreements, conditions, understanding, inducements, warranties, and
representations, oral or written, express or implied, other than as set forth
in this agreement.
   (l)   In the event any term or provision of this agreement shall for any
reason be held invalid, same shall not affect any other term or provision
hereof.
   (m)   This agreement is subject to and conditioned upon receipt by the
county of a writing from the City of Cleveland acknowledging that the City of
Cleveland has received a copy of this agreement, and acknowledging that the
City of Cleveland has no objection to the general nature, import and tenor of
its terms.

shall in every case pursue the following procedure:
   (a)   The subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat of the proposed
subdivision which shall conform with the requirements set forth in Section
1244.07, and shall file with the Chairperson of the Planning Commission an
application in writing for the approval of the preliminary plat, accompanied by
six blueprints, at least two weeks prior to the meeting of the Planning
Commission at which action is desired.
   (b)   The preliminary plat shall be checked by the Commission as to its
conformity with any Major Street Plan in effect at the time of submission of
the plat, and with the principles, standards and requirements hereinafter set
forth, and the Secretary shall transmit a copy of the preliminary plat to the
Village Engineer for recommendations concerning matters within his or her
jurisdiction.
   (c)   Upon the receipt of a preliminary plat of a proposed subdivision which
has been presented to the Commission for approval, the Commission shall send
notice of the filing thereof to adjoining property owners and others considered
by the Commission to be affected by the proposed subdivision. A reasonable time
as set forth in the notice shall be allowed for a reply from such property
owners before action is taken on the preliminary plat by the Commission.
   (d)   The Commission shall approve or disapprove the preliminary plat, or
approve it with modifications, within thirty days of the filing thereof, noting
thereon any changes that are required. One copy shall be returned to the
subdivider with the date of the approval or disapproval endorsed thereon. A
similar copy shall also be transmitted to the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 1983-36. Passed 4-11-84.)
   (e)   The subdivider, after the plans and specifications for the
improvements have been approved by the Village Engineer, may then secure from
the Village Clerk the necessary permits to proceed with the street and sanitary
improvements required under Chapter 1248, upon payment of the fees required
under Section
1242.01, and upon submission to the Village Solicitor of sufficient evidence
that the subdivider has secured liability insurance as set forth in Section
1244.02(a).
1244.04   MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT BOND.
   (a)   After the completion of all required improvements in accordance with
the standards and specifications of the Village pertaining to such improvements
and to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer, the subdivider shall provide a
maintenance bond in an amount determined by Council, but not less than ten
percent of the improvement costs, which will ensure the Village that the
improvements installed will be properly maintained and that any defects in
material or construction will be corrected during a period of two years after
completion of construction of all dwellings on each sublot shown on the
subdivision plat, and, after approval and acceptance of the improvements by the
Village. The subdivider, however, shall immediately file with the Village
Engineer, upon approval and acceptance of the improvements by the Village, an
original tracing in waterproof ink and on tracing cloth, together with three
blueprints, of the final plat meeting the requirements stipulated in Section
1244.08.
(Ord. 1993-48. Passed 10-13-93.)
   (b)   In lieu of completing the required improvements, the subdivider may
execute and file with the Village Clerk an agreement and bond in an amount
determined by Council, in a form satisfactory to the Solicitor, equal to the
approximate total cost of such improvements, which will insure to the Village
that the improvements will be completed within two years after final approval
of the improvement plans.
1244.05   PREPARATION AND REVIEW OF FINAL PLAT.
   (a)   The final plat shall be accompanied by a certificate of title showing
that the ownership of all lands to be dedicated to public use is free and
unencumbered.
(Ord. 1983-36. Passed 4-11-84.)
   (b)   The final plat shall be filed with the Village Engineer at least two
weeks prior to the meeting of the Planning Commission at which action is
desired.
(Ord. 1987-40. Passed 2-10-88.)
   (c)   The Village Engineer shall check the final plat as to computations,
certifications, lot areas and numbers, monuments, etc. If found satisfactory,
he or she will transmit all copies of the final plat to the Commission,
together with the certificate of title and a two-fold certificate showing that:
      (1)   The technical details of the plat itself have been checked and
found satisfactory; and
      (2)   All improvements have been completed in accordance with the
standards and specifications of the Village and to the Engineer's satisfaction,
or satisfactory bond has been executed and filed with the Village Clerk.
(Adopting Ordinance)
   (d)   After the final plat, together with such certificates, has been
received by the Commission, and provided that the final plat is found to
conform with the preliminary plat as approved and with the requirements set
forth in these Regulations, the original tracing of the final plat shall be
sent to Council for review of the dedicated portions and the locations and
limitations of easements shown on the plat, before the Commission will give the
final plat its final approval and endorse the same thereon. A print, together
with the certificate of title, will be transmitted by the Commission to Council
for necessary action on any proposed dedication, and if accepted for
dedication, such acceptance should be noted in the original tracing.
   (e)   The original tracing of the final plat so endorsed will then be
returned to the subdivider. The final plat of the subdivision, so approved,
shall then be filed by the subdivider for record in the office of the County
Recorder. After recording, the subdivider shall return the original tracing of
the final plat to the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 1987-40. Passed 2-10-88.)
1244.06   GENERAL INFORMATION AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   It is suggested that the subdivider or his or her engineer consult
with the Village Engineer while the plat is in sketch form and before the
preliminary plat is prepared, to ascertain the location and extent of proposed
Village streets, parks and other public grounds and of other planned projects
and developments related to the proposed subdivision.
   (b)   The approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Commission is
tentative, may be revoked within ninety days of the filing thereof and does not
constitute acceptance of the subdivision. It shall be considered only as an
approval of the layout, with the understanding that the Village Engineer will
examine the grades of streets, the types of improvements and the design of the
drainage, sewerage and water systems as proposed, and may modify any
engineering or construction details submitted by the subdivider whenever
required for the protection of the public interest.
(Ord. 1983-36. Passed 4-11-84.)
   (c)   Unless the subdivider has secured permits to commence the improvements
within one year from the approval of the preliminary plat, the original
approval of the preliminary plat will be deemed revoked. The Planning
Commission may, for good cause shown, extend the approval of the preliminary
plat beyond the one-year period.
(Ord. 1987-40. Passed 2-10-88.)
   (d)   The final plat of any portion of a larger subdivision, the preliminary
plat of which has been approved by the Commission, may be submitted for final
approval.
   (e)   The approval of the final plat by the Commission shall not be deemed
to constitute or effect an acceptance by the public of the dedication of any
street or other proposed public way or space shown on the plat.
   (f)   Approval of the final plat by the Commission shall be null and void if
the plat is not offered for record within thirty days of such approval and
accepted for record within sixty days after the date of approval.
   (g)   A subdivider will be permitted to file a plat "for record purposes
only," provided that he or she conforms with all the requirements of these
Subdivision Regulations as if the installation of improvements were a condition
precedent to acceptance by the Village of the final plat, and provided,
further, that the final plat does not accept dedication of any streets or
easements and that the subdivider is required to complete the improvements or
file a satisfactory performance bond approved by the Solicitor before any
structures are erected. Upon the acceptance by the Village of the subsequent
improvements, the subdivider is required to submit a final plat for dedication
for approval and acceptance by Council pursuant to the requirements of these
Subdivision Regulations.

1262.02   VARIANCES AND APPEALS.
   (a)   Variances. A variance is a deviation from the strict or literal
requirements of a zoning or planning regulation. In such instance where the
Building Inspector has determined that a variance is needed in order for an
application to be approved, the Village Planning Commission shall review the
request for a variance and make a recommendation to Council whether such
variance should be authorized. In these specific cases, such variance from the
terms of the zoning regulations shall not be contrary to the public interest or
the intent of these zoning regulations. However the Planning Commission shall
consider where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these zoning regulations would result in practical difficulties
to the applicant. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or
buildings in the same district and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands,
structures or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for the
issuance of a variance.
      (1)   Requesting a variance.
         A.   A variance from the terms of these zoning regulations shall not
be considered by the Village Planning Commission for recommendation to Council
unless the applicant has provided sufficient evidence to warrant the granting
of a variance, and a written request for a variance is submitted containing the
following information:
            1.   Description of and nature of the variance requested;
            2.   A narrative statement demonstrating the practical difficulty
that the applicant is experiencing;
            3.   In addition, the applicant will be responsible for payment for
all expenses, including, but not limited to, engineering, legal, postage and/
or other professional expenses incurred by the Village (as indicated in Section
1262.06 Filing Fees).
         B.   Such variance request shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission for review at the same time as the original application. The Village
Fiscal Officer shall notify all adjoining property owners in writing of such
request and of all hearing dates regarding such request via regular U.S. mail.
      (2)   Standards for granting variances. The following factors shall be
considered and weighed in determining whether a property owner has a practical
difficulty, these factors shall include but not be limited to:
         A.   Whether the property will yield a reasonable return or whether
there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
         B.   Whether the variance is substantial;
         C.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
         D.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services;
         E.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restriction;
         F.   Whether the property owner's predicament can feasibly be obviated
by some method other than a variance;
         G.   Whether the spirit and intent of the zoning requirement would be
observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance;
         H.   Additional factors are to be considered for flood plain areas;
refer to Section
1273.05 of this code and for riparian setbacks refer to Section
1271.11 of this code.
      (3)   Granting of a variance. If after considering the above factors as
well as the opinion of the Building Inspector and/or the Village Engineer, the
Planning Commission makes a determination that such variance should be granted,
such recommendation shall be made to Council at the next regular meeting of
Council. If Planning Commission makes a determination that such variance should
not be granted, such recommendation shall be made to Council and the applicant
may appeal such recommendation to Council.
   (b)   Appeals. If the Planning Commission either disapproves an application
or does not recommend a request for a variance; the applicant may appeal to
Council.
      (1)   Procedure for appeal.
         A.   An appeal from the decision or recommendation of the Planning
Commission shall be made within thirty days and shall be filed with the Village
Administrative Assistant on the form proscribed. Such appeal application shall
contain the following information:
            1.   Name, address, and telephone number of the appellant;
            2.   Legal description of the property;
            3.   Description of the application and/or variance requested;
            4.   A narrative statement regarding the application and/or
variance and the applicant's practical difficulty if appropriate.
            5.   In addition, the applicant will be responsible for payment for
all expenses, including, but not limited to, engineering, legal, postage and/or
other professional expenses incurred by the Village as indicated in Section
1262.06 of this Code.
         B.   Council shall make an examination and investigation as it deems

or at the next regular meeting held thereafter, but in no event later than
sixty days after the presentation of the appeal.

(Ord. 2011-65. Passed 5-21-12.)
1267.02   DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this section, the following terms shall have the meaning
herein indicated:
   (a)   “Conservation Development District (“District”)” means a contiguous
area of land to be planned and developed as a single entity, in which housing
units are accommodated under more flexible standards, such as building
arrangements and setbacks, than those that would be applied under single-family
district codes, allowing for flexible groupings of houses in order to conserve
open space and existing natural resources.
   (b)   “Conservation easement” means a legal interest in land that restricts
development and other uses of the property in perpetuity for the public purpose
of preserving the rural, open, natural, or agricultural qualities of the
property as authorized by Ohio R.C. 5301.67 through 5301.70.
   (c)   “Development agreement” means the complete package of information and
submittals an applicant for a Conservation Development District must have
approved by the Village before beginning construction in the District. This
agreement shall contain approved versions of the following:
      (1)   Subject parcel's approval for a Conservation Development District.
      (2)   Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and/or Cuyahoga County Board
of Health approval of the on-site wastewater disposal system.
      (3)   Development plan.
      (4)   Fully executed conservation easement.
      (5)   Existing conditions site report.
      (6)   Yield plan.
      (7)   Stormwater management plan.
      (8)   Covenants and restrictions for the homeowners association or

from the remainder of the parcel by a slope exceeding twenty-five percent, an
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency Category 2 or 3 wetland, a watercourse, or
other feature that would not support a road and/or crossing under normal
building standards and applicable State and Federal permit requirements, thus
rendering the isolated portion unbuildable under conventional development
standards and applicable local, State, and Federal codes.
   (g)   “Privately owned building lot” are those portions of the permitted
buildable area of a Conservation Development District associated with each
single-family residential unit in the District and solely controlled by the
owner of that unit.

1273.01   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   General purpose. This chapter adopts regulations for areas of special
flood hazard that are necessary for participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village has special flood hazard areas that are
subject to periodic flooding which may result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (4)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (5)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (6)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (7)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (8)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (9)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village as
identified in division (f) below, including any additional areas of special
flood hazard annexed by the Village.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and /or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective December 3, 2010.
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio, which has been approved
by the Village as required by Section
1273.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
      (3)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations.
Such maps and/or studies are on file at the Village and its assigned agents.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
building or zoning codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement, but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these
regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2004-23. Passed 11-17-04; Ord. 2010-27. Passed 9-15-10.)

areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   "Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)" means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   "Fill" means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   "Flood or Flooding " means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or

   (l)   "Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)" means usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (m)   "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   "Flood Insurance Risk Zones" means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:

subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   "Zone C and Zone X (unshaded)". Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   "Flood Insurance Study (FIS)" means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.

no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water

places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis" means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   "Letter of Map Change (LOMC)" means an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC's are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   "Manufactured home park" as specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured
homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue
purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure
used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land
that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are
for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the
lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured
homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)" is a federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   "New construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village
of Bentleyville's Flood Insurance Rate Map dated August 1, 1980, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   "Person" includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. "Agency" does not include the general assembly,
the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (bb)   "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   "Registered Professional Architect" means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Sections 4703.01
to 4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   "Registered Professional Engineer" means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   "Registered Professional Surveyor" a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   "Special Flood Hazard Area" also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99.
   (gg)   "Start of construction" means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   "Substantial Damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   "Substantial Improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed.
      The term does not, however, include :
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure, " provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   "Variance" means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.
(Ord. 2004-23. Passed 11-17-04.)

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the Village's flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1273.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development that impacts floodway delineations or base
flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data reflecting
such changes are submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1273.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1273.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Building Inspector
shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map Revision from
FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1273.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor, and may be
submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority
over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain
management regulations for a particular area. In order that the Village's Flood
Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the Village boundaries, include within
such notification a copy of a map of the Village suitable for reproduction,
clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village
has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1273.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including tornado, wind, heavy snow, flood, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.

            2.   An evaluation of alternatives that would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the Village of Bentleyville and
the Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
      (2)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Planning and Zoning
Commission may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1273.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
(Ord. 2004-23. Passed 11-17-04.)
1273.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Village Council shall hear and decide all appeals where it is
alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination
made by the Floodplain Administrator, Building Inspector, and/or Planning and
Zoning Commission in the administration or enforcement of these regulations.
      (2)   The Village Council may authorize variances in accordance with
division (b) of this Section.
   (b)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in practical difficulties may file an
application for a variance. The application shall first be submitted to the
Planning Commission for its recommendation and then to the Village Council for
final decision. The Village Council shall have the power to authorize, in
specific cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not
inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public
interest as determined by Council where, owing to special conditions of the lot
or parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in practical difficulties.
      (1)   Application for a Variance. The application process for variances
to these regulations will follow the application procedures for zoning
variances set forth in Section
1262.02 of the Village's Ordinances.
      (2)   Public Hearing. Village Council shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that is not subject to flooding and erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Additional Conditions of Variances Specific to this Section. Along
with the standards for granting a variance, Planning Commission and Council
shall also consider whether granting of a variance will increase flood heights
beyond that which is allowed in these regulations; additional threats to public
safety; extraordinary public expense; nuisances. Additionally, a variance shall
not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
      (4)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.

      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, Building

1274.01   PERMIT REQUIRED; APPLICATION INFORMATION.
   Inasmuch as the removal of topsoil, trees and other vegetation, loam, sand,
gravel, rock, stone, clay and other similar substances from land, results in
noise and the creation of large quantities of dust, which prove obnoxious to
inhabitants in the vicinity thereof; creates erosion and drainage problems,
swamps and lakes, frequently results in damage to adjoining properties by
disturbing the substructure thereof, tends to have a disrupting effect on
ground water supplies, and creates other similar dangers to public health and
safety; results in unsightly and blighted areas unfit for other and useful
purposes, thus retarding or preventing the development of desirable
residential, commercial and industrial areas, depressing property and other
values in the neighborhood and permanently destroying the land, leaving it
almost valueless for any purpose; creates highway hazards by occasioning heavy
trucks and other equipment on the roads, and the scattering of earth and debris
thereon; and, unless properly planned, regulated and supervised, has an adverse
effect upon the public peace, health, safety and general welfare; therefore,
any person wishing to change the contours of land by grading, excavating or
filling, or desiring to remove topsoil, trees and other vegetation, loam, sand,
gravel, rock, stone, clay and other similar substances from land located in any
area or place within the Village, shall first, prior to commencing or
continuing any such operation, file with the Village Engineer a written
application for permission to carry on such operations, which application shall
contain the following information:
   (a)   The name and address of the applicant and the name and address of the
owner of the land if it is different from that of the applicant.
   (b)   A description of the land, with boundaries, upon which such operations
are proposed to take place. A map of the land, showing its location and
dimensions and indicating what part or parts thereof on which it is desired to
conduct grading, excavating, filling or removal operations, shall accompany the
application.
   (c)   The method of operation to be employed; the time within which such
work is to be commenced and completed; the existing and proposed topography of
the land and its ultimate proposed use; the type and nature of refilling,
reseeding or replanting proposed. Such application shall also contain a
statement that the applicant and the owner of the land will furnish a
performance bond of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per acre, or
fraction thereof, included in the permit, if granted, for changing the contours
of the land by grading, excavating or filling, or for the removal of topsoil or
loam; and not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) per acre, or fraction
thereof, included in the permit, if granted, for other removals in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter.
   (d)   The name and address of any person who or which, it is contemplated,
will do the actual work of grading, excavating, filling or removal. If any such
agreement, contract, lease or other arrangement is in writing, a copy thereof
must be attached to the application; if such is not in writing, that statement
must be made in the application.
   (e)   A storm water pollution prevention plan shall be developed per
Chapter 1278.

owner of the land at the addresses given in the application not less than three
days prior to the public hearing, excluding the day of the mailing and
including the day of the public hearing. If, after such hearing, the Planning
Commission determines that the granting of the application will not adversely
affect the public welfare, peace, health, safety and convenience, it shall
grant the application with such conditions relating to the method of grading,
excavating, filling or removal of the land or area on which the operations are
to be conducted, the terms of the permit, the amount of topsoil or loam to be
respread on the land, the amount of removal which may be permitted on the land,
the refilling, reseeding or replanting of the land, the drainage after removal,
and such other conditions, as the Planning Commission may deem necessary for
the protection of the public health, safety, peace, convenience and welfare,

request of the Village Fiscal Officer. If such deposit exceeds such
expenditure, the balance shall be refunded to the applicant.
   (b)   If the application is granted, the applicant shall reimburse the
Treasurer for any expenses incurred in connection with Village supervision or
inspection of the operations as outlined in the permit. Statements for such
expenses shall be submitted to the permit holder by the Treasurer and shall be

involve a change of land contours, then the provisions of this chapter shall be
followed, or, if it is a minor project in the opinion of the Municipal
Engineer, it shall be governed by Section
1274.05. In no event shall any portion of a proposed pond be permitted within
75 feet of an abutting owner's property line. Permission for the creation of a
pond within 75 feet of an abutting owner's property line may be granted only
upon a special permit being approved by Council upon such terms and conditions
as it may impose after obtaining the written recommendations and report of the
Engineer regarding such request.

   (b)   Any structure or building, or any portion thereof, used for human
habitation shall be deemed to be in an unclean and unsanitary condition when it
is unfit for human habitation or in a condition dangerous or harmful to the
lives or health of the occupants by reason of the inhabited portion of the
house being damp or wet, or by reason of such lack of repair, such accumulation
of dirt, filth, litter, refuse or other offensive or dangerous substances or
liquids, such defects in or lack of repair or improper use of the drainage,

(Ord. 1983-35. Passed 4-11-84.)
1278.03   NOTICE FOR ABATEMENT OR VACATION OF PREMISES.
   (a)   Whenever the Board of Health of the County ascertains, from
examination or reports of its inspectors or sanitary officers or otherwise,
that a public nuisance exists, as defined herein, in or upon any structure or
building, or portion thereof, and is of the opinion that such nuisance is
capable of being abated without immediate vacation of the premises or such
portion thereof, and serves notice upon the owner of such house, or his or her
lessee or agent, or the person in possession, charge or control thereof,
directing him or her to abate such nuisance and remove the unclean or
unsanitary conditions within such reasonable time as may be fixed by the Board
and specified in the notice, it shall then be the duty of such owner, agent or
person to abate such nuisance within such time. Whenever such abatement does
not take place within such time, or whenever, in the opinion of the Board, such
abatement is impossible or impracticable without an immediate vacation of the
house or portion thereof, and the Board serves notice upon the owner, lessee,
agent or person in possession, charge or control thereof to vacate or cause the
vacation of such house or portion thereof designated in the notice, then it
shall be the duty of such owner, lessee, agent or person to vacate or cause the
vacation of such house or portion thereof within twenty days time, but not less
than twenty-four hours in any case, as may be specified in the notice.
   (b)   Whenever, either in addition to or without the service of such notices
on the owner, lessee, agent or person in possession, charge or control of such
house, or any part thereof, the Board is of the opinion that such nuisance can
be abated by a tenant or other occupant of such house, or portion thereof, and
such notices, either for abatement of the nuisance or for vacation of the
premises, are served upon such tenant or other occupant, then it shall be the
duty of such tenant or other occupant to comply with the terms of such notices
and to abate the nuisance or vacate the premises accordingly. After any such
notice of vacation it shall be unlawful to occupy or permit the occupancy of
such premises, or portion thereof, except as otherwise provided herein, until
such nuisance shall have been completely abated and such building, or portion
thereof, shall have been rendered clean and sanitary in accordance with the
terms of such notices of the Board of Health.
   (c)   When there is no owner, agent, lessee or person in charge, possession
or control of such house, or part thereof, who is a resident or who can be
served in the Village, then personal service outside of the Village on any such
owner, agent, lessee or person in charge, possession or control by anyone
delegated by the Board of Health to make such service, or by registered letter,
or if the address of the owner, lessee, agent or person in possession, charge
or control is unknown, or service is not secured by registered letter after
effort to do so, then by notice by publication once a week for two consecutive
weeks in any newspaper of general circulation in the Village, or by posting or
attaching to or on the outside of such structure or building of a copy of the
notice or order consecutively for two weeks, shall have the same effect as
service within the Village.
(Ord. 1983-35. Passed 4-11-84.)
1278.04   VACATION AND ABATEMENT HEARINGS.
   When a notice of vacation follows a notice of abatement, as provided herein,
such notice of vacation shall not be enforced as provided in this chapter,
unless such notice of abatement specified a time when the person so notified
may appear before the Board issuing the same to show cause why such notice of
vacation should not be issued, and unless the Board or a majority thereof is
present at its office at the time so specified, such time to be not less than
twenty-four hours after the service of the notice. When the notice of vacation
is issued as provided herein without a previous notice of abatement, such
notice of vacation shall not be enforced as provided in this chapter unless it
specifies a time, not less than five days after the service thereof, when the
person so notified may appear before the Board issuing the same to show cause
why such notice should not be enforced, and such Board or a majority thereof is
present at its office at the time so specified, provided, however, that when,
in the opinion of at least four-fifths of the members of such Board, an
emergency exists which requires, for the protection of the health of occupants,
the vacation of the building, or portion thereof, without a delay of five days,
then no such fixing of a time for hearing shall be required.
(Ord. 1983-35. Passed 4-11-84.)
1278.05   POSTING NOTICE OF VACATION.

1278.07   ENFORCEMENT THROUGH COURT PROCEEDINGS.
   When the Board of Health shall certify to the Village Solicitor any failure
to comply with any such notice of vacation, with the request that civil
proceedings for the enforcement thereof be instituted, the Solicitor shall
institute any and all proceedings, either legal or equitable, that may be
appropriate or necessary for the enforcement of such notice and the abatement
of the nuisance against which such notice was directed. Such suits or
proceedings shall be brought in the name of the Village. Proceedings under this
section shall not relieve any party defendant from criminal prosecution or
punishment under this chapter or any other criminal law or ordinance in force

such violation within in a reasonable time limit set by the Building Inspector.
   (b)   Further, any approved applicant for registration shall indemnify and
save harmless the property owner and/or lessee, tenant or other person
contracting for work and materials, guaranteeing that all workmanship and
materials are in conformity with this Ohio Building Code, the Codified
Ordinances of the Village of Bentleyville and the said property owner, lessee,

1448.09   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
stage of construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls.
BMP selection and design must meet the criteria established within the current
Construction General Permit. BMP's must be designed, constructed, and installed
to meet the specifications in the Rainwater and Land Development or another
design manual acceptable to the Village of Bentleyville. The approved SWP3, and
the sediment and erosion controls, and non-sediment pollution controls
contained therein, shall be implemented, and maintained according to the
requirements in the Construction General Permit. Site operators must conduct
site inspections as described in the construction General Permit.
   (a)   Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All SCMs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. All
sediment SCMs must be maintained in a functional condition until all up-slope
areas they control reach final stabilization. The owner shall provide a
description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the continued
performance of SCMs and shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding
to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the Village Engineer. When
inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of erosion
and sediment control SCMs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When SCMs require repair or maintenance. If an internal inspection
reveals that a SCM is in need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of a
sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within three days of
the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within
ten days of the inspection.
      (2)   When SCMs fail to provide their intended function. If an internal
inspection reveals that a SCM fails to perform its intended function as
detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be
installed within three to ten days of the inspection as determined by the
Village Engineer or his/her designated site inspector.
      (3)   When SCMs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an internal
inspection reveals that a SCM has not been implemented in accordance with the
schedule, the control practice must be implemented within ten days from the
date of the inspection. If the internal inspection reveals that the planned
control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
   (b)   Final Stabilization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
Village Engineer. Once a definable area has achieved final stabilization, the
owner may note this on the SWP3 and no further inspection requirement applies
to that portion of the site. Final stabilization also requires the installation
of permanent (post-construction) stormwater control measures (SCMs).
Obligations under this chapter shall not be completed until installation of
post-construction SCM is verified.
   (c)   Disposition of Temporary Practices. All temporary and permanent
erosion and sediment control practices shall be disposed of within thirty days
after final site stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are
no longer needed, unless otherwise authorized by the Village Engineering
Department. Trapped sediment shall be permanently stabilized or removed to
prevent further erosion.

shall submit an abbreviated SWP3 in accordance with the requirements of this
regulation.
   (b)   The abbreviated SWP3 shall be certified by a registered professional
engineer, a registered professional surveyor, certified professional erosion
and sediment control specialist, or a registered landscape architect.
   (c)   The abbreviated SWP3 shall include a minimum of the following SCMs.
The Village may require other SCMs as site conditions warrant.
      (1)   Construction entrances. Construction entrances shall be built and
shall serve as the only permitted points of ingress and egress to the
development area. These entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of
aggregate stone or recycled concrete, or cement sized greater than two inches
in diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and constructed in conformance
with specifications in the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land
Development.
      (2)   Concrete truck wash out. The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be indicated on the
plan. Use for other waste and wastewater is prohibited.
      (3)   Street sweeping. Streets directly adjacent to construction
entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned
daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on
these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall be cleaned weekly.

instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion matting.
 
      (5)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems, including rear yard inlets. Straw, hay
bales, and filter socks around an inlet are not acceptable forms of inlet
protection.
      (6)   Silt Fence and other perimeter controls. Silt fence and other

General Permit.
      (7)   Internal inspection and maintenance. All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within twenty-four hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of
rain per twenty-four- hour period. Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.   When SCMs require repair or maintenance. If the internal
inspection reveals that a SCM needs repair or maintenance, with the exception
of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within three
days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained
within ten days of the inspection.
         B.   When SCMs fail to provide their intended function. If the
internal inspection reveals that a SCM fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
abbreviated SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be installed
within ten days of the inspection.
         C.   When SCMs depicted on the abbreviated SWP3 are not installed. If
the internal inspection reveals that a SCM has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten days from the date of the inspection. If the inspection reveals that the
planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
      (8)   Final stabilization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
Village Engineer.

1450.01   PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Village of Bentleyville.
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the Village to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
stormwater control measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and ground water are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the Village's future
expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in this section.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County, and the
Village of Bentleyville shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects
initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable, for
projects initiated before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a comprehensive stormwater management
plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the Village Engineer. Such projects must be designed to minimize
the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of
Chapter 1448, Erosion and Sediment Control.
   (g)   This regulation does not apply to construction or re-construction of
stand-alone single-family dwellings when the parcel is not part of an overall
subdivision or is part of a subdivision that is in existence as of the adoption
of this chapter, unless otherwise required by the Village Engineer.

constructed, manufactured or otherwise, that provide treatment of the water
quality volume (see Table 4 of this section), detention, retention, and/or
infiltration, and all related activities, shall not be constructed in any
special flood hazard area, as defined in
Chapter 1273 , Flood Damage Prevention.
      (6)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels. All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, twenty-four- hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance
channels, the owner shall consider public safety as a design factor and
alternative designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a
safe design.
      (7)   Exemption. The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of this section if it can be shown to the
satisfaction of the Village Engineer that the site is part of a larger common
plan of development where the stormwater management requirements for the site
are provided by an existing SCM, or if the stormwater management requirements
for the site are provided by SCMs defined in a regional or local stormwater
management plan approved by the Village Engineer.
      (8)   Maintenance. All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
inspection and maintenance agreements approved by the Village Engineer as
detailed in Section
1450.08 .
      (9)   Agreements with sub-dividers or developers. A sub-divider or
developer shall be required to construct an on-site SCM for the purposes of
water quality and water retention approved by the Village Engineer. The
combination of stormwater quality and quantity requirements for two or more
developments may be placed into one detention basin to be located at a
strategic site given that a separate agreement with all parties is developed.
The Village shall enter into an agreement with the sub-divider or developer, to
be approved by Council, containing the following conditions:
         A.   The sub-divider of a major subdivision shall require the
formation of a homeowners' association, which shall assume responsibility for
all maintenance, upkeep, repair, replacement and management of the SCM. In
other developments, the sub-divider or developer shall make provisions
acceptable to the Village for maintenance of the SCM area as stated in Section
1450.10. Easements shall be granted to the Village for access to and
maintenance of the stormwater management area.
         B.   If more than one development is to use a single SCM, a separate
association of all members using that SCM shall be formed. This association
will be held responsible for all future maintenance and repairs of the SCM as
stated in this chapter.
         C.   The sub-divider or developer shall be exempt from the application
of this section only if authorized by the Village Engineer.
         D.   Where a sub-divider or developer is exempt from the provisions of
this section, that sub-divider or developer shall comply with and pay fees in
accordance with this chapter, governing subdivisions and development prior to
the effective date of this section.
         E.   All SCMs will be placed within blocks and/or easements to allow
Village access (see Section
1450.11).
      (10)   Preservation of existing natural drainage. SCMs that preserve and/
or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum extent
practicable. Such SCMs may include minimizing site grading and compaction;
protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and existing
vegetation; and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction operations in
order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time, and designation
of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and grubbing practices;
and maintaining un-concentrated stormwater runoff to and through these areas.
Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide perpetual management of
runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving stream's physical, chemical and
biological characteristics are protected, and ecological functions are
maintained.
      (11)   Preservation of wetland hydrology. Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters a wetland(s) in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydro period,
and wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope. SCMs such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration basins,
conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent streams,
depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the wetland
hydrology. If the owner proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a
hydrological analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed
discharge matches the pre-development hydro periods and hydrodynamics.
            If the owner proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a
hydrological analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed
discharge matches the pre-development hydro periods and hydrodynamics.
      (12)   Soil preservation and post-construction soil restoration. To the
maximum extent practicable leave native soil undisturbed and protect from
compaction during construction. Except for areas that will be covered by
impervious surface or have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil moisture-
holding capacity of areas that have been cleared and graded must be restored to
that of the original, undisturbed soil to the maximum extent practicable. Areas
that have been compacted or had the topsoil or duff layer removed should be
amended using the following steps: 1. till subsoil to a depth of fifteen-
eighteen inches, 2. incorporate compost through top twelve inches, 3. replace
with stockpiled site or imported suitable topsoil to a minimum depth of four
inches.
   (c)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria. All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Stream/storm sewer discharge. The stormwater facility (storm sewer
main or natural watercourse) that will convey the discharge from the site shall
be analyzed to determine if it is capable of conveying the additional storm
sewer discharge from the site of a 100-year/24-hour storm. If the designated
outlet is not capable of conveying the discharge from the site during the 100-
year/24-hour storm, then additional storage must be placed onsite to store the
additional volume for a period of forty-eight hours or the outlet modified to
convey the discharge.
      (2)   Surface water protection. The Village Engineer may allow
modification to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only
if the owner shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the
Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable Federal, State, and local
agencies as required in Section
1450.07 , and the activity is in compliance with
Chapter 1448 , Erosion and Sediment Control and
Chapter 1271 , Riparian Setbacks all as determined by the Village Engineer. At
a minimum, stream relocation designs must show how the project will minimize
changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat
of upstream and downstream channels on and off the property.
      (3)   Off-site stormwater discharges. Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the owner's development site shall be conveyed through
the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at its
existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive stormwater management plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that off-
site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a
manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (4)   Sheet flow. The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. Flow shall be
directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or other SCMs from areas too long
and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as determined by the Village
Engineer.
      (5)   Open channels. Unless otherwise allowed by the Village Engineer,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with landscaped
banks and designed to carry the ten-year, twenty-four-hour stormwater runoff
from upstream contributory areas.
      (6)   Drainage systems. Open drainage systems shall be preferred on all
new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer systems
shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities allowed
under Village zoning or where the use of an open drainage system affects public
health or safety, all as determined by the Village Engineer. The following
criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewer design flow shall be based on the Rational Method.
Storm sewers shall be designed per
Chapter 1242 . The system shall be designed to meet these requirements when
conveying the flows from the contributing area within the proposed development
and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream from the development.
These calculations will be reviewed and approved by the Village Engineer prior
to design acceptance. Rainfall data shall be obtained from the latest volume of
the NOAA Rainfall ATLAS 14 or Table 1. Runoff coefficients shall be per Table
2.

(t+b)Ac
         Where:
            i   = Rainfall intensity (in./hour)
            t   = Time of concentration (minutes)
         Refer to Ohio Department of Transportation's Location & Design Manual,
Volume 2 (or latest edition) Drainage Design, Figure 1101-2 for Rainfall
Intensity Constants (a, b & c). The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope
that produces no less than 2.5-fps and no more than a 10-fps velocity within
the pipe barrel under design flow conditions.
         C.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is twelve inches.
         D.   All stormwater conveyance systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
            1.   Previous studies on file with the Village.
            2.   FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
            3.   Calculations prepared by a registered professional engineer.
         E.   Catch basin design spread calculations shall be submitted to the
Village Engineer for review to determine catch basin spacing and sizing. At a
minimum, there shall be at least one total clear lane during a twenty-five
year, twenty-four-hour storm.
         F.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Outlets discharging into an open-water conveyance structure shall
have an invert at a minimum of three inches above the average water depth
during the snow-melt season.
         I.   The flood elevation for a 100-year, twenty-four-hour storm must
be a minimum of ten feet away horizontally from the perimeter of any homes
within the new subdivision, nor cause any home flooding to adjacent neighboring
properties, and shall be at least two feet below the finished grade elevation
of any livable structure.
         J.   All storm sewer outlets from a subdivision must flow either into
a public storm sewer, stream of the State, or a major ditch unless authorized
by the Village Engineer.
         K.   The maximum distance for sheet flow shall be 300 feet before
entering a storm structure. Except, that the maximum overland drainage area
tributary to the storm structure shall be no greater than 1.5 acres.
      (7)   Water resource crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the Village:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 100- year, twenty-four-hour storm or
as indicated by the Village Engineer. The maximum allowed headwater for such a
storm shall be twelve inches below pavement crown elevation. Water crossings
carrying receiving waters located near upstream Village borders shall convey no
more flow than currently designed to carry unless directed by the Village
Engineer.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State scenic rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of one foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or
conveyance must be sized to carry the 100-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be twelve inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a ten-
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of five square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be one-foot below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the
100-year, twenty-four-hour storm, or the 100-year flood elevation as determined
by FEMA, whichever is more restrictive.
      (8)   Overland flooding. Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100-year, twenty-four-hour storm event to an
adequate receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained
within the drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause
flooding of buildings or related structures. The peak 100- year water surface
elevation along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the
finished grade elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing
paths, the conveyance Village of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (9)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation. In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the Village must be
compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First consideration for
the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be given to areas
where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new floodplain
within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also be given to
enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for floodplain
fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing watershed. Unless
otherwise permitted by the Village, reductions in volume due to floodplain
fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the development.
Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must reasonably conform to
the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The use of vertical
retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (10)   Velocity dissipation. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (d)   Stormwater Quality Control. The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more SCM's that meet or exceed the criteria in the
Construction General Permit.
   (e)   Stormwater Quantity Control. The comprehensive stormwater management
plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the critical storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a one-year, twenty-four-hour
storm occurring on the same development drainage area under pre-development
conditions.
      (2)   Developers or sub-dividers shall include in their preliminary plans
a local watershed study to determine the impact from the development or
subdivision caused by stormwater onto the lands adjoining or downstream from
the area to be developed, to assure that said lands shall not be adversely
affected by the proposed development or subdivision.
      (3)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
critical storm, up to the 100-year, twenty-four- hour storm shall have peak
runoff discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent
size storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-
year storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this
requirement.
      (4)   The critical storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method, or other
hydrologic method approved by the Village Engineer, the total volume (acre-
feet) of runoff from a one-year, twenty-four-hour storm occurring on the
development drainage area before and after development. These calculations
shall meet the following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            4.   Rainfall data shall be obtained from the latest volume of the
NOAA Rainfall ATLAS 14 or per Table 1.
            5.   Temporal distribution - Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than one
year. Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition.
            6.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition must reflect
the average type of land use over the past ten years and not only the current
land use. Curve numbers shall conform to the National Engineering Handbook
Table 9-1.
               a.   Post-development curve numbers - All areas that are altered
by construction practices shall use postconstruction hydraulic soil groups from
Ohio Rainwater and Land Development.
            7.   Time of concentration - Use velocity based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
            8.   The volume reduction provided by permeable pavement,
bioretention, or other LID SCMs may be subtracted from the post development
stormwater volume. Volume reductions for these practices may be demonstrated
using methods outlined in Ohio Rainwater and Land Development or a hydrologic
model acceptable to the Village Engineer.
            9.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the
site, calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or
concrete for all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface
proposed in the site description, except in instances of engineered permeable
pavement systems.
         B.   From the volume determined in division (d)(3)A. of this section,
determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to development. Using
the percentage, select the twenty-four-hour critical storm from Table 3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff
is:                                               The Critical Storm will be:
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff
is:                                               The Critical Storm will be:
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:
-                         10                      1 year
10                        20                      2 year
20                        50                      5 year
50                        100                     10 years
100                       250                     25 year
250                       500                     50 year
500                       -                       100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the critical storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under predevelopment conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet predevelopment peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
         C.   For sites with less than one acre of disturbed land and not part
of a common plan of development:
            1.   If the post-developed flow for the critical storm is less than
110 percent of the pre-developed critical storm flow, no stormwater quantity
measures need to be implemented.
            2.   If the post-developed flow for the critical storm is equal to
or greater than 110 percent of the pre-developed critical storm, stormwater
quantity measures need to be implemented so that the post-developed critical
storm flow is less than the pre-developed critical storm flow.
   (f)   Stormwater Management for Previously Developed Areas.
      (1)   SCM's on previously developed sites must meet the criteria in the
Construction General Permit.
         (Ord. 2011-31. Passed 7-20-11; Ord. 2017-5. Passed 1-18-17; Ord. 2022-
54. Passed 12-21-22.)
1450.10   ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   When the Village of Bentleyville determines that site constraints compromise
the intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in
an improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the standards in the Construction General Permit and
shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity control that would be
achieved by the on-site controls required under this regulation. The Village
Engineer may require proof of Ohio EPA review and approval for any alternative
action proposed.
(Ord. 2011-31. Passed 7-20-11; Ord. 2017-5. Passed 1-18-17; Ord. 2022-54.
Passed 12-21-22.)
1450.11   EASEMENTS.
   Access to SCMs as required by the Village Engineer for inspections and
maintenance shall be secured by easements in the event that they are not
performed by the owner, homeowner's association, or other private party. The
following conditions shall apply to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the inspection and maintenance
agreement submitted with the comprehensive stormwater management plan.
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the Village prior to approval of a
final plat and shall be recorded with the Cuyahoga County Auditor and on all
property deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the Village Engineer, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less than twenty-five-
feet wide. The easement shall also incorporate the entire SCM plus an
additional twenty- five-foot wide band around the perimeter of the SCM.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the inspection and maintenance agreement for the site.
   (e)   Easements to structural SCMs shall be restricted against the
construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and other structures that may
obstruct the free flow of stormwater and the passage of inspectors and
maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final grade from that
described by the final grading plan approved by the Village. Any re-grading
and/or obstruction placed within a maintenance easement may be removed by the
Village at the property owners' expense.
      (Ord. 2011-31. Passed 7-20-11; Ord. 2017-5. Passed 1-18-17; Ord. 2022-54.
Passed 12-21-22.)
1450.12   MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed by the owner and provided to the
Village Engineer:
   (a)   Final stabilization must be achieved and all permanent SCMs must be
installed and made functional, as determined by the Village Engineer and per
the approved comprehensive stormwater management plan.
   (b)   An as-built certification, including as-built survey and inspection,
must be sealed, signed and dated by a registered professional engineer and a
registered professional surveyor with a statement certifying that the SCMs, as
designed and installed, meet the requirements of the comprehensive stormwater
management plan approved by the Village Engineer. In evaluating this
certification, the Village Engineer may require the submission of a new set of
SCM calculations if he/she determines that the design was altered significantly
from the approved comprehensive stormwater management plan. The as-built survey
must provide the location, dimensions, and bearing of such SCMs and include the
entity responsible for longterm maintenance as detailed in the inspection and
maintenance agreement.
   (c)   A copy of the complete and recorded inspection and maintenance
agreement as specified in Section
1450.08 must be provided to the Village Engineer.
      (Ord. 2011-31. Passed 7-20-11; Ord. 2017-5. Passed 1-18-17; Ord. 2022-54.
Passed 12-21-22.)
1450.13   ON-GOING INSPECTIONS.
   The owner shall inspect SCMs regularly as described in the inspection and
maintenance plan and inspection and maintenance agreement. The Village has the
authority to enter upon the property to conduct inspections as necessary, with
prior notification of the property owner, to verify that the SCMs are being
maintained and operated in accordance with this regulation. Upon finding a
malfunction or other need for maintenance or repair, the Village shall provide
written notification to the responsible party, as detailed in the inspection

   The comprehensive stormwater management plan review, filing, and inspection
fee is part of a complete submittal and is required to be submitted to the
Village before the review process begins. The Village Engineer shall establish
a fee schedule based upon the actual estimated cost for providing these

1450.15   BOND.
   (a)   If a comprehensive stormwater management plan is required by this
regulation, soil-disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond
of five percent of the total project cost of the SCMs, has been deposited with
the Village Finance Department. This bond shall be posted for the Village to
perform the obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner of the
development area as stated in this regulation and to allow all work to be
performed as needed in the event that the owner fails to comply with the
provisions of this regulation. The stormwater bond will be returned, less
Village administrative and review fees when the following three criteria are
met:
      (1)   After eighty percent of the lots of the project have been complete
or 100 percent of the total project has been permanently stabilized or three
years from the time of permanent stabilization have passed.
      (2)   An as-built inspection of all SCMs is completed by the owner and
approved by the Village Engineer.
      (3)   An inspection and maintenance agreement signed by the developer,
the contractor, the Village, and the private owner or homeowners association
who will take long term responsibility for these SCMs, is accepted by the
Village Engineer.
   (b)   Once these criteria are met, the owner shall be reimbursed all bond
monies that were not used for any part of the project. If all of these criteria
are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site, the
Village may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding issues with all
stormwater management structures on the site and the remainder of the bond
shall be given to the private lot owner/homeowners association for the purpose
of long term maintenance of the project.

1450.16   INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY SCMS.
   The owner may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the Village Engineer. This occurs after the completion of the
final grade at the site, after all of the utilities are installed, and the site
is subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods. The
developer must provide documentation acceptable to the Village Engineer to
demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized. Upon this proof of
compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed and placed into
service. Upon completion of installation of these SCMs, all disturbed areas
and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these SCMs must be
stabilized within two days.
