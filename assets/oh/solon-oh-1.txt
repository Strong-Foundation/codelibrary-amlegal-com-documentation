Preamble
   We, the people of the Village of Solon, in the County of Cuyahoga, State of
Ohio, in order to secure the benefits of municipal home rule and local self-
government under the Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio, do hereby
adopt this Charter.
ARTICLE I
NAME
   The municipality now existing in the County of Cuyahoga, State of Ohio, and
known as Solon shall continue to be a body politic and corporate under the name
of the Village of Solon. If and when the municipality of Solon shall, under the
Constitution and the general laws of the State of Ohio, become a city, it shall
be known as the City of Solon, and wherever in this Charter the word “Village”
appears, it shall then be construed to read “City,” and the provisions of this
Charter shall apply whether this municipality is a Village or a City.
ARTICLE II
BOUNDARIES
   The City of Solon shall have the same boundaries as now exist, but with
power and authority to change its boundaries in the manner authorized by the
laws of Ohio, except that no territory shall be detached from or annexed to the
City, nor shall the City be annexed to, or merged with, any other body politic,
nor shall the corporate existence of the City be terminated, without the assent
of a majority of the electors of the City voting on such proposal, or the
assent of the Council subject to approval by a vote of a majority of electors
of the City voting on such proposal. Any such proposal shall be submitted to
the electors only at a general election in such manner as the Council shall by
resolution or ordinance prescribe.
ARTICLE III
POWERS
   The City of Solon shall have all the powers, general or special,
governmental or proprietary, which may now or hereafter lawfully be possessed
or exercised by municipalities under the laws of Ohio. All such powers may be
exercised in the manner prescribed in this Charter; or, if not prescribed
herein, in such manner as Council may determine; or, unless a contrary intent
appears in this Charter or in the enactments of the Council, as may now or
hereafter be provided by the laws of Ohio.
ARTICLE IV
THE COUNCIL
SECTION 1. COMPOSITION AND TERM.
   The legislative power of the City, except as limited by this Charter and
such additional powers as may be expressly granted by this Charter, shall be
vested in a Council of seven members. Each member of Council shall be a
resident of and elected from each of the wards set forth in
Section 1A hereof. The terms of the members of the Council shall begin the
first day of December next following their election and they shall serve for a
term of four years or until their successors are chosen and qualified except
that the four members of Council elected from Wards 1, 3, 5 and 7 at the
regular municipal election in the year 1989 shall serve for two years only, and
thereafter for a term of four years.
(Approved by voters 11-8-1988; 11-8-2005)
SECTION 1A. ALTERATIONS IN WARD BOUNDARIES; PROCEDURE.
   (a)   The Council of the City shall, after each recurring Federal census,
and within 180 days after the issuance of the proclamation of the Secretary of
State of the State of Ohio as to the population of the City, adopt an ordinance
subdividing the City into seven wards as nearly equal in population as
practicable. All wards shall be bounded as far as practicable by county lines,
streets, alleys, avenues, public grounds, watercourses, municipal corporation
lines and centerlines of platted streets or railroads, and shall be composed of
adjacent and compact territory.
   (b)   In the interim between Federal census dates, the Council may review
the population of the wards of the City and if it is deemed necessary to change
the boundaries of the wards to insure representation equal to population, it
may adopt an ordinance changing ward boundaries during any even-numbered year.
   (c)   Prior to taking any action to change the ward boundaries of the City,
the Council shall appoint a Commission composed of not less than one adult
resident of each ward of the City to study and review the ward boundaries and
to make its recommendations to the Council.
   (d)   In the event that Council does not pass by ordinance updated ward
boundaries within 180 days after the issuance of the proclamation of the
Secretary of the State of Ohio as to the population of the City, then the Mayor
shall determine the ward boundaries which shall be enacted at the time set
forth below.
   (e)   Upon the adoption of an ordinance, or submittal by the Mayor changing
ward boundaries as authorized in this
Section 1A , the ward boundaries described in
Section 1  of Article IV shall not be in effect after the expiration of the
current terms of incumbent Councilperson.
   (f)   This
Section 1A  of Article IV of the City Charter shall become effective on January
1, 2006.
(Approved by voters 11-7-1967; 11-8-2005)

body now or hereafter created, shall be vested in the Council except as
otherwise provided in this Charter.
SECTION 4. COUNCIL MEETINGS.
   The Council shall hold at least one regular meeting in each calendar month.
A majority of the members of the Council shall constitute a quorum for the

members in such manner and under such penalties as may be prescribed by
ordinance. At any meeting at which a quorum is present, any ordinance or
resolution may be passed or adopted, or any other action taken, by the
affirmative votes of four members of the Council unless a larger number be
required by the provisions of this Charter or by the laws of Ohio. The Clerk of
the Council shall keep a record of its proceedings in a journal in which the

   The Council shall by ordinance make provision for:
   (a)   The time and place of regular meetings of the Council;
   (b)   The method of calling special meetings of the Council;
   (c)   The form and method of enactment of its ordinances and adoption of its
resolutions except that each ordinance or resolution shall, before its passage,
be read by title only on three separate days, and except as hereinafter set

concurrence of at least five Councilmen; provided, however, that any emergency
measure may be passed after one reading and the legislative authority may
require any reading to be in full by a majority vote of its members and in the
case of an Ordinance being considered for certification to the Board of
Elections to place an initiative on the ballot regarding any amendment to the
Zoning Code and/or map of the City shall, without exception, be read by title

and adoption of its resolutions, and of any other of its acts or proceedings
which it deems proper to publish;

   (f)   The advertising and awarding of contracts;
   (g)   Such other general regulations as the Council may deem necessary,
including regulations as to the custody and use by the Clerk of Council of an

(Approved by voters 11-3-2015; 11-5-2019)
SECTION 6. EFFECTIVE DATE OF ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS.
   Each ordinance providing for (a) the appropriation of money, (b) an annual
tax levy, and (c) improvements petitioned for by the owners of a majority of
the foot frontage of the property benefited and to be specially assessed
therefor, and (d) any emergency ordinance or resolution necessary for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety, shall take
effect, unless a later time be specified therein, upon its signature by the
Mayor, or upon the expiration of the time within which it may be disapproved by
the Mayor, or upon its passage after disapproval by the Mayor, as the case may
be. No ordinance, resolution or initiative petition that must be approved by a
majority of the electors voting thereon, in accordance with the provisions of
Article XIV of this Charter, regarding any addition or deletion of uses in a
zoning district, or changes the zoning map of any property in the City shall go

there is a change in the uses in a zoning district located in any ward in the
City, and the results of the election at which said vote is had are officially
certified by the appropriate election authorities. Any ordinance adopted by the
Council certifying an initiative to the Board of Elections for placement on the
ballot shall take immediate effect upon adoption by a majority of Council,
shall not be required to be signed by the Mayor, and shall not be subject to
referendum, in order to carry out the Ohio constitutional right of initiative
provided to the electors of the City. No other ordinance or resolution shall go
into effect until 40 days after its final passage by the Council. Each
emergency measure shall contain a statement of the necessity for such emergency
action and shall require the affirmative votes of at least five members of the
Council for its enactment. No action of the Council (a) providing for the
surrender or joint exercise of any of its powers, (b) granting any franchise,
or (c) contracting for the supply to the City or its inhabitants of the product
or service of any utility, whether municipally owned or not, shall be taken as
an emergency measure.
(Approved by voters 11-8-1977; 11-6-2012; 11-5-2019)
SECTION 7. VACANCIES IN COUNCIL.
   In the event that Council determines that a member of Council is unable to
perform his or her duties because of prolonged illness, physical or mental
disability or absence from the municipality, Council may, after written notice
and a public hearing has been provided the member of Council so affected and/or
his representative, and upon the affirmative vote of five members, declare the
office of such member of Council vacant. In the event that the office of a
member of Council shall become vacant by reason of death, resignation,
disqualification from office, by declaration of Council pursuant to and for the
reasons stated in this section, such vacancy in Council shall be filled by a
majority vote of all the remaining members of Council. If the vacancy shall not
be so filled within 45 days from the date of such vacancy, the Mayor shall fill
it by appointment. Any such appointee shall qualify under
Article VIII, Section 2 and shall hold office and serve for the unexpired term
or until a successor is elected and qualified. A successor shall be elected
(for the balance of the unexpired term) at the next regular municipal election
for municipal officers, provided that:
   (a)   Such election occurs at least two years prior to the expiration of the
unexpired term; and
   (b)   The vacancy occurs more than 90 days prior to such election.
   Within five days after the occurrence of the vacancy, Council shall convene
and officially cause written notice to be immediately delivered to the Board of
Elections of Cuyahoga County advising such Board of Elections of the existence
of the vacancy and the need for a municipal election to be held pursuant to the
provisions of this section and other provisions of this Charter. The candidate
receiving the largest number of votes to fill the vacancy at the regular
municipal election for municipal officers shall be declared elected to such
office and shall assume the office of Councilperson for the unexpired term then
remaining immediately upon certification.
(Approved by voters 11-8-1988; 11-7-1995; 11-7-00; 11-8-2005)

authentication is proper. Council may employ any other employees it may deem
necessary for the proper discharge of its duties. Any person employed by the
Council shall serve at the pleasure of the Council.
   (b)   All notices or other communications to Council and to the City

by the Council from time to time, to furnish a bond or bonds for the faithful

for any such bond shall be paid by the City. The compensation of each member of
the Council shall be fixed at least 120 days prior to their election for the
terms beginning on the next succeeding first day of December, and shall not
thereafter be changed in respect to any such terms or part thereof, except that
the compensation of members of Council for the unexpired portion of their four-
year terms shall be changed to correspond to the compensation fixed for members
of Council commencing new four-year terms, so that a uniform rate of
compensation will be paid to all members of Council. The compensation of each
other officer, employee and any member of a board or commission of the City
shall be fixed by Council and, subject to the power of Council to provide
otherwise by ordinance or resolution, may be changed at any time at its
discretion. Council may authorize the payment or reimbursement of expenses
incurred by any officer or employee of the City or by any member of any board
or commission of the City in trips taken in the interest of the City. (Approved

for the term beginning on the next succeeding first day of December and shall
thereafter be reviewed by Council on an annual basis in respect to any such
terms or any part thereof. The Mayor shall be the highest compensated executive
officer of the City. Another City executive officer’s longevity compensation
shall be excluded from the calculation to determine whether the Mayor is the
highest compensated executive officer of the City.

SECTION 2. RECALL.
   (a)   The electors shall have the power to remove from office by a recall
election any elected officer of the City. If an elected officer shall have
served for six months of his term, a petition demanding his removal may be
filed with the Clerk of the Council who shall note thereon the name and address
of the person filing the petition and the date of such filing. Such petition
may be circulated in separate parts, but the separate parts shall be bound
together and filed as one instrument. Each part shall contain the name and
office of the person whose removal is sought and a statement in not more than
200 words of the grounds for the removal. Such petition shall be signed by at
least that number of electors which equals 25 percent of the electors voting
for that office at the last preceding general election. Within ten days after
the day on which such petition shall have been filed, the Clerk shall determine
whether or not it meets the requirements hereof.
   (b)   If the Clerk shall find the petition insufficient, the clerk shall
promptly certify the particulars in which the petition is defective, deliver a
copy of his certificate to the person who filed the petition with the clerk,
and make a record of such delivery. Such person shall be allowed a period of 20
days after the day on which such delivery was made in which to make the
petition sufficient. If the Clerk shall find the petition sufficient, the clerk
shall promptly so certify to the Council, shall deliver a copy of such
certificate to the officer whose removal is sought, and shall make a record of
such delivery. If such officer shall not resign within five days after the day
on which such delivery shall have been made, the Council shall thereupon fix a
day for holding a recall election, not less than 75 days, nor more than 120
days after the date of such delivery. At such recall election this question
shall be placed on the ballot: “Shall (naming the officer) be allowed to
continue as (naming the office)?” with provision on the ballot for voting
affirmatively or negatively on such question. If a majority of the votes cast
at such election shall be voted affirmatively, such officer shall remain in
office. If a majority of the votes cast shall be voted negatively, such officer
shall be considered as removed, such office shall be deemed vacant, and such
vacancy shall be filled as provided in this Charter. The officer removed by
such recall election shall not be eligible for appointment to the vacancy
created thereby.
(Approved by voters 11-7-1995; 11-3-2015)
SECTION 3. ASSISTANCE FROM LAW DIRECTOR TO INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM OR RECALL.
   (a)   The electors who sponsor an initiative, referendum or recall petition
may, if they desire, request certain assistance from the City Council;
provided, however, that the electors who sponsor such petitions and who request
such assistance present to the City Council a written request stating their
proposal and signed by at least 100 registered voters, or by a number of
registered voters equal to at least one percent of the number of electors who
voted for Governor at the last preceding general election in Solon, whichever
is the greater.
   (b)   The assistance requested from the City Council may include all or part
of the following:
      (1)   Approval as to form of such petition prior to the circulation
thereof; provided however, that in the case of referendum petitions, the
submission of such petition to the City Council shall be made within a period
of five days after the adoption of the ordinance or other measure sought to be
referred.
      (2)   Advice as to the legal requirements involved in the circulation and
filing of such petition.

ARTICLE X
FINANCES
   The laws of Ohio relating generally to budgets, appropriations, deposits,
expenditures, debts, bonds, contracts and other fiscal matters of the

provision therefor is made in the Constitution of the State of Ohio.

firm or corporation to construct or operate a public utility on, across, under

excess of 25 years; and it may prescribe in the ordinance the kind or quality
of service or product to be furnished, the rate or rates to be charged
therefor, and such other terms as it shall deem conducive to the public
interest. Such franchise may be amended or renewed in the manner and subject to
the provisions established herein for original grants. No consent of the owner
of property abutting on any public street or real estate shall be necessary to
the effectiveness of any such grant, amendment or renewal. All such grants,
amendments and renewals shall be made subject to the continuing right of the
Council to provide reasonable regulations for the operation of such utilities
with reference to such streets and public real estate, including the right to
require such reconstruction, relocation, alteration or removal of structures
and equipment used in such streets or public grounds as shall, in the opinion

the City setting forth any proposed amendment to the Charter, it shall submit
such proposed amendment to the electors. The Council shall determine the manner
of the submission of any proposed amendment to the electors to the extent that
such submission is not governed by the Constitution and the laws of Ohio. If
any such proposed amendment shall be approved by a majority of the electors
voting thereon, it shall become a part of this Charter; except that, if two or
more inconsistent proposed amendments on the same subject shall be submitted at
the same election, only the one of such amendments receiving the largest
affirmative vote, not less than a majority, shall become a part of the Charter.
ARTICLE XIII
MISCELLANEOUS
SECTION 1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CHARTER.
   For the purpose of nominating and electing officers of the Village, fixing
the compensation of those to be elected in 1955, and establishing the
provisions of Article II herein, this Charter shall be in effect from and after
the date of its approval by the electors of the Village; and for all other
purposes the Charter shall be in effect on and after the first day of January,
1956.
SECTION 2. EFFECT OF PARTIAL INVALIDITY.
   A determination that any part of this Charter is invalid shall not
invalidate or impair the force or effect of any other part hereof, except to
the extent that such other part is dependent for its operation upon the part
declared invalid.
SECTION 3. EFFECT ON EXISTING LAWS AND RIGHTS.
   This Charter shall not affect any vested rights or accrued liabilities of
the Municipality of Solon, nor any right or liability in any pending suit or
prosecution either on behalf of or against the Municipality, nor any contract
heretofore entered into by the Municipality, nor any franchise heretofore
granted by the Municipality, nor any prior or pending proceedings for the
authorization of public improvements or the levy of assessments therefor.
Except as a contrary intent appears herein, all acts of the Council of the
Municipality in effect as of December 31, 1955, shall continue thereafter in
effect until lawfully amended or repealed.
SECTION 4. INTERPRETATION OF THE CHARTER.
   The article and section headings herein have been inserted for convenience
in reference and are not intended to define or limit the scope of, or otherwise
affect, any provision of this Charter.
SECTION 5. OPEN MEETINGS WITH EXECUTIVE SESSION AUTHORIZATION.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Charter, including, but not
limited to,
Article IV, Section 4, above, all meetings, both regular and special, of all
municipal public bodies, including Council, its committees, and all boards and
commissions, shall be open to the public, except closed meetings may be held
after a majority of a quorum determines, by a roll call vote, to hold an
executive session for the sole purpose of considering any of the following
matters:
   (a)   (1)   To consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion or compensation of a public employee or official, or the
investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual, unless the public employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual requests a public hearing. Except as
otherwise provided by law, no public body shall hold an executive session for
the discipline of an elected official for conduct related to the performance of
his official duties or for his removal from office.
      (2)   If a public body holds an executive session pursuant to this
subsection, the motion to vote to hold that executive session shall state which
one or more of the approved purposes listed in this subsection are the purposes
for which the executive session is to be held, but need not include the name of
any person to be considered at the meeting.
   (b)   (1)   To consider the purchase of property for public purposes, or for
the sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of
information would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a
person whose personal, private interest is adverse to the general public
interest. No member of a public body shall use this division as a subterfuge
for providing covert information to prospective buyers or sellers. A purchase
or sale of public property is void if the seller or buyer of the public
property has received covert information from a member of a public body that
has not been disclosed to the general public in sufficient time for other
prospective buyers and sellers to prepare and submit offers.
      (2)   If the minutes of the public body show that all meetings and
deliberations of the public body have been conducted in compliance with this
section, any instrument executed by the public body purporting to convey,
lease, or otherwise dispose of any right, title or interest in any public
property shall be conclusively presumed to have been executed in compliance
with this section insofar as title or other interest of any bona fide
purchasers, lessees, or transferees of the property is concerned.
   (c)   Conferences with an attorney for the public body concerning disputes
involving the public body that are the subject of pending or imminent court
action.
   (d)   Preparing for, conducting or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment.
   (e)   Matters required to be kept confidential by Federal law or rules or
State statutes.
   (f)   Specialized details of security arrangements where disclosure of the
matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the purpose
of committing, or avoiding prosecution for, a violation of the law.
   If a public body holds an executive session to consider any of the matters
listed in subsections (b) through (f), the motion and vote to hold that
executive session shall state which one or more of the approved matters listed
in those subsections are to be considered at the executive sessions.

   (a)   Any initiative petition that proposes a change in the zoning code of
the City or any change in the zoning map of the City shall first be filed by
the petitioner with the Clerk of Council to be held for a period of 10 days.
After the initiative petition has been filed with the Clerk of Council for a
period of 10 days, the petitioners may circulate the petition filed with the
Clerk of Council.
   (b)   After the petitioners have submitted their petitions to the Clerk of
Council, and upon completion of circulation within the City, the Clerk of
Council shall submit such petitions to the Board of Elections to determine if
there are sufficient valid signatures of electors of the City. The Board of
Elections shall certify whether such petitions contain the signatures of not
less than 10 percent of the number of electors who voted for Governor at the
most recent general election for the Office of Governor in the City. In the
event such initiative petitions do not contain sufficient signatures to meet or
exceed 10 percent of the number of electors that voted for Governor at the most
recent general election for the office of Governor in the City, the petitioners
may seek additional signatures of electors of the City.
   (c)   Once the initiative petitions are certified by the Board of Elections
to have not less than 10 percent of the number of electors who voted for
Governor at the most recent general election for the office of Governor in the
City, the initiative shall be placed on the agenda for the next regular Council
meeting. At the first regular Council meeting at which the initiative is
considered, a public hearing before Council shall be set with at least 10 days
advance notice. The notice shall conform to the requirements for notification
of public hearings whenever any amendment to the zoning code and/or map of the
City is being proposed as provided in the zoning code of the City. The public
hearing shall be held at a regular Council meeting.
   (d)   The Ordinance before Council shall be read at three consecutive
regular meetings and shall not be read at any special meeting. At the third
regular meeting, and after the public hearing on the initiative proposal,
Council shall determine if the initiative petitions, and the process of placing
such initiative before Council, comply with the Charter and, to the extent
applicable, the Ohio Revised Code. The form of the petition and circulation and
signing of the petitions by the circulators shall conform to the requirements
of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (e)   Council shall act upon the initiative petitions to determine whether
the petitions are to be certified to the Board of Elections for consideration
at the next regularly held general or primary election no later than the third
reading and the Council may only deny certification if they find the petitions
are not sufficient and valid by specifying how the petitions do not comply with
the Charter and/or the Ohio Revised Code.

of Elections, the Clerk of Council, no later than five days after passage of
such Ordinance, shall certify the Ordinance to the Board of Elections and
deliver the initiative petitions to the Board of Elections requesting that the
initiative be placed on the ballot of the next regularly held primary or
general election occurring more than 90 days after adoption of the Ordinance
certifying the initiative to the Board of Elections. Any Ordinance approving
certification of the initiative to the Board of Elections to be placed on the
ballot to be considered by the electors shall take effect immediately upon
final action by Council, and the Clerk of Council shall forthwith certify the
Ordinance for delivery to the Board of Elections. Council shall not dispense
with three readings of the Ordinance at three consecutive regular Council

§ 202.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF RE-ENACTMENT, AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing provision of the Codified Ordinances does
not revive the provision originally repealed nor impair the effect of any
saving clause therein.
   (b)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of a provision of the Codified
Ordinances does not, except as provided in division (c) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the provision or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred with respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal; and/or
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy with respect to any

the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the

   (c)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of a provision of the Codified Ordinances, the
penalty, forfeiture or punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed
according to the provision as amended.
(R.C. § 1.58)
§ 202.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of a provision of the Codified Ordinances

(R.C. § 1.55)
   (b)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections, or of divisions or other subdivisions of a section, such
reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any section, division or
other such subdivision included in such reference.
   (c)   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized
under designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case,
action taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(R.C. § 1.23)
§ 202.06 SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are separable.
(R.C. § 1.50)
§ 202.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (a)   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be subject to a
misdemeanor of the 1st degree which will include a fine not exceeding $1,000, a

CHAPTER 204: OFFICIAL STANDARDS
Editor’s note:
   The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from 2:00 a.m.
of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in October.
Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring uniform
observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in 1967,
except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from Daylight
Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with a
different time standard. The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.

naming and renaming city property, spaces and programs. Specific recognition
may be given to donors by way of naming an interior space, exterior space,
building, furnishing or fixture, placement of name on a donor wall or other
item that commemorate a gift.
(Ord. 2022-220, passed 12-5-2022)
§ 212.02 GENERAL GUIDELINES.
   (a)   Solon City Council shall have the authority to designate a certain
name, and approve the naming of, city property.
   (b)   The Mayor and City Council consider the naming of city property,
spaces and programs in honor or in memory of a living or deceased individual,
event, corporation, foundation or organization to be one of the highest
distinctions the city can bestow.
   (c)   No name shall be given to any public property that may limit its use.
   (d)   The naming of public property shall not provide a property right to
the individual, corporation or organization recognized in the name, nor to the
donor of the property or funds in the event the named property is donated or
purchased with funds designated for the acquisition of certain property by the
city.
   (e)   There shall be no assumption of right for a private donor to name a
public property because the property was a gift to the city unless such right
is expressly agreed upon in an agreement between the donor and the city.
   (f)   A developer may name the residential subdivision plats and streets if
the names are in compliance with the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code and
Solon Code of Ordinances.
(Ord. 2022-220, passed 12-5-2022)
§ 212.03 STANDARDS FOR NAMING OF CITY PROPERTY, SPACES AND PROGRAMS.
   (a)   Community standards. The naming of city property, space or program
shall be considered by the members of City Council and shall fulfill at least
one of the following community standards for recognition:
      (1)   A person, living or deceased, or group is to be recognized by the
city for an action of historical or cultural significance or demonstrated
excellence to the City of Solon, the State of Ohio, the United States or the
world.
      (2)   A person, living or deceased, was associated with the City of Solon
as either a resident, elected official, or volunteer in the city community, and
was instrumental in furthering the interests of the city through leadership or
civic responsibility, and engaged in activities beneficial to the city.
      (3)   The person, living or deceased, risked their life to save or
protect others.
      (4)   Recognition of a certain person, group or event is consistent with
the public policy of the city.
      (5)   The requirements of philanthropic considerations, as discussed in
division (b) of this section, have been met and merit recognition.
   (b)   Philanthropic contractual agreements and plans. The naming of city
property, space or program may be considered as a part of a contractual
agreement between the city and a party for the provision of significant funding
toward the cost of renovation of city property or the construction of public
property and shall be referred to as a philanthropic contractual agreement.
Significant funding provided to the city under a philanthropic contractual
agreement shall be broadly construed but shall include substantial
contributions that completely or significantly enable a city property
renovation or construction project to occur. Significant funding under this
section shall include, but not be limited to, monetary donations, donations of
real property and sponsorship agreements. The naming of city property, space,
or program as a condition of a philanthropic contractual agreement shall be
reviewed as a part of any city project and shall be exempt from the general
process requirements of §
212.05. The Mayor shall review and present any proposal for a philanthropic
contractual agreement to City Council for its review and approval, and a
philanthropic contractual agreement shall not be effective without the approval
of City Council.
      (1)   City property, spaces or programs may be named after an individual,
group, entity or event pursuant to the terms and conditions of a philanthropic
contractual agreement meeting the requirements of this division (b) so long as
the philanthropic contract agreement provides the term, or length of time, the
city property, space or program shall hold the name specified, as well as one
of the following:
         A.   Real property donated to the city is, or shall be, deeded to the
city, and such donation or transfer of property is not required by a separate
agreement, or by reason of any ordinance, law or regulation.
         B.   The amount of the contribution of capital funding toward the city
project, by way of a donation, a series of donations, or sponsorship agreement,
is clearly specified in the philanthropic contractual agreement, and such
donation or sponsorship agreement is not required by a separate agreement, or
by reason of any ordinance, law or regulation.
      (2)   The city may establish philanthropic naming rights plans, approved
by City Council, for components of city facilities, including but not limited
to rooms within a building, athletic fields, gardens, playgrounds, bricks for a
path, walkway or building, subject to the following:
         A.   Assets for naming opportunities may be offered and may be valued
and allocated as donations towards capital costs, operating costs or
maintenance costs, and the same shall be determined based on the desirability
or marketability of the project and naming opportunity.
         B.   City Council shall approve the comprehensive naming rights plan
for a certain city project or facility, as the case may be, listing the naming
rights offered by the city in exchange for certain levels or values of funding
donated to the city.
         C.   Any naming rights plan or agreement enter into pursuant to this
subsection shall be consistent with this Policy.
   (c)   Limitations and restrictions on the naming of city property, spaces
and program.
      (1)   Naming rights may be approved by City Council for a specific term,
which may not be longer than the useful life of the property, space or program.
      (2)   Names that are contrary to public policy, such as discriminatory or
derogatory names, will not be considered by the Mayor or City Council.
      (3)   The receipt of a donation in exchange for the naming of city
property, space or program, shall be consistent with the public policy.
      (4)   The approval of naming rights for city property, spaces or programs
pursuant this Policy shall not entitle the naming person or entity, or donor,
to any preferential treatment by the city and all terms and conditions of
receipt by the city of a donation or sponsorship in exchange of the naming of
certain city property, space or program shall be contained within the agreement
between the parties.
(Ord. 2022-220, passed 12-5-2022)
§ 212.04 SIGNAGE.
   (a)   A sign or plaque that explains the significance of the name of city
property, space or program, so named pursuant to the requirements of this
Policy, may be placed on the site of the property, space or program.
   (b)   All signs or plaques placed on or at city property shall comply with
all city ordinances and requirements.
(Ord. 2022-220, passed 12-5-2022)
§ 212.05 PROCESS FOR NAMING CITY PROPERTY, SPACES OR PROGRAMS.
   (a)   In naming a city property, space or program the following process
shall be followed:
      (1)   The requesting party shall submit an application or proposal to the
Mayor that fulfills the requirements of §
212.03. The application or proposal shall specify the term, or length of time,
the city property, space or program shall have the proposed name. The Mayor
shall review the application or proposal and forward it to City Council with a
recommendation for consideration at the next most convenient Council meeting.
      (2)   Upon notice and review of the application or proposal and the
recommendation of the Mayor, City Council will, by majority vote, decide
whether to forward the application or proposal to an appropriate committee of
Council, to take no further action on the request, or to act on the application
or proposal immediately. Approval of any application or proposal shall only be
achieved by a majority vote of City Council members approving the application
or proposal to name a city property, space or program.
      (3)   If, under division (a)(2) of this section, City Council forwards
the application or proposal to a committee of Council, the following shall
apply:
         A.   The committee may consult with or obtain the agreement of the
parties involved in the naming of city property, space or program such as the
individual, or next of kin in the case of a deceased individual, or the
authorized representative of an entity, group or organization.
         B.   The committee must reach a decision and recommendation for naming
within 90 days of City Council's transfer of the matter to the committee, or
within such time provide notice to City Council of the committee's need for
additional time.
         C.   City Council shall review the recommendation of the committee and
determine, by majority vote, whether to approve the application or proposal.
      (4)   Approved applications, or proposals, shall be kept on file with the
Clerk of Council as a permanent record.
   (b)   The size and design of any signs or plaques associated with the naming
of city property, spaces or programs pursuant to this Policy shall comply with
city codes and ordinances and, if applicable, must be approved by the
appropriate city official, committee or City Council.
   (c)   It shall be the intent of this Policy that the naming of city
property, spaces or programs pursuant to this Policy shall be for a specific
term, or length of time, so specified in the application or proposal approved
by City Council. If City Council shall determine that renaming city property,
space or program, prior to the expiration of the term of the then present name
of the property, space or program so designated pursuant to City Council
approval, is in the best interest of the city, the following process and
considerations shall be followed:
      (1)   Renaming of city property, space or program, when such is already
named for a person, group, event or entity, shall only be undertaken when such
person, group, event or entity for whom the name so recognizes is determined to
be disreputable, immoral or otherwise undeserving of the honor of recognition
in or on city property.
      (2)   Honorary dedications may be included and added as a secondary name
to city property, space or program, rather than renaming the same, as long as
the second name complements the existing name of such city property, space or
program. It such case, the naming process of this section shall be followed to
add a secondary name or dedication.

§ 212.06 AMENDMENTS.
   The guidelines, policy and procedure of this Policy shall be amended as
necessary with the approval of City Council.

§ 234.035 CREDIT CARD POLICY.
   The purpose of this policy is to ensure that the appropriate level of
internal controls for city credit card accounts are maintained to provide for
and to guard against misuse or losses for which the city may be held
financially liable. This policy is intended to comply with the mandates set
forth in Sub HB 312 enacted by The 132nd Ohio General Assembly or any successor
legislation enacted for this purpose. The city's credit card accounts are not
intended for personal use, and city-issued credit cards will not be permitted
to be carried by city personnel on a regular basis for any reason. All city
credit card accounts shall be issued in the name of a city department.
   (a)   This policy applies to all (i) payment cards, checks or other payment
instruments associated with a credit account issued by a financial institution
or a retailer, and (ii) payment cards related to the receipt of grant funds.
All such cards and instruments are referred to herein as "credit cards".
   (b)   This policy does not apply to procurement cards (P-cards), or to
gasoline account cards or, other payment cards that are capable of use only for
the purchase of certain limited types of goods.
   (c)   The city will not obtain or maintain any debit cards.
   (d)   The Director of Finance will work with the appropriate financial
institutions that issue credit cards to determine the best type of credit card
accounts for the city, and also to determine which retail purpose credit card
accounts the city will be permitted to utilize.
      (1)   The Director of Finance is responsible for working with the issuing
financial institution to determine the dates when credit cards expire and the
re-issuance of replacement cards.
      (2)   The Director of Finance is responsible for determining, when
necessary, the need to cancel a credit card account and any adjustment to
credit limits on the credit cards.
      (3)   The Director of Finance is responsible for notifying the issuing
financial institution of a lost or stolen card.
   (e)   Credit cards will be established in the name of the City of Solon and
the specific name of a city department with a maximum credit limit for the card
program and for each card as set by the Director of Finance. No single credit
card purchase shall exceed the credit card limit without prior written
authorization from the Director of Finance. The credit limits on individual
departmental cards shall be communicated to city departments and be included in
the current version of the credit card policy manual as defined in section (p).
   (f)   Prior to initial receipt of a credit card, each departmental user must
acknowledge the requirements for use by signing the credit card authorization
and use procedures.
   (g)   The Mayor shall authorize the use of city credit cards for use in
connection with approved or city related activities and only those types of
expenses that are for the benefit of the city that serve a valid and proper
public purpose shall be paid for by credit card. Credit cards will be used
primarily for approved travel expenses, memberships, professional dues, and
prepayment for goods or services when required by a vendor. Credit cards may be
used only for expenditures that are within the applicable budget and
established purchasing guidelines as defined in §
234.03 of the Solon Code.
   (h)   Regular purchasing procedures must be followed for all credit card
purchases. Every credit card purchase must have a valid purchase order assigned
to it before the purchase is permitted. The purchase order must contain the
vendor and the purpose, account number and estimated amount.
   (i)   For each purchase made using a credit card, an itemized receipt
indicating the amount paid, the vendor, and the goods/services purchased must
be submitted to the Director of Finance promptly following the purchase.
   (j)   Use of a credit card for personal expenditures, for expenditures in
excess of the applicable credit limit, or otherwise in violation of this policy
constitutes a misuse of the credit card. Any city personnel engaging in misuse
of a credit card will be responsible to reimburse the city for any unauthorized
expenditures and may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment.
   (k)   The Director of Finance will designate a Finance Department employee
as Credit Card Compliance Officer to review all credit card accounts on an
annual basis, including; the number of accounts and issued/active cards,
account expiration dates and credit limits. The Director of Finance may not
also serve as the Compliance Officer.
   (l)   The Compliance Officer may not authorize city personnel to use a
credit card and may only use a credit card with the prior authorization of the
Director of Finance.
   (m)   If a credit card is lost or stolen, or if city personnel become aware
of unauthorized or fraudulent use of any of the city's credit card accounts,
the same must be reported immediately to the Director of Finance and Compliance
Officer.
   (n)   All monthly credit card statements, access to online credit card
accounts, and other correspondence associated with the credit card accounts
will be managed by the Director of Finance or the Compliance Officer or other
designee. Payment of the monthly statements must be made in a timely fashion so
that finance charges and late payment fees are not incurred.
   (o)   If the Compliance Officer is authorized to use a credit card, on a
monthly basis, the Director of Finance (or the Director of Finance's designee,
who may not be the Compliance Officer) will review the credit card statements
for proper use and documentation prior to submission for payment by the city.
   (p)   The Director of Finance shall establish and may amend the policies and
procedures which are deemed necessary to the operation of the credit card
policy as defined herein. The establishment of policies and procedures will
include the issuance of policy manual(s), process guidance, forms, reports, and

and effective credit card policy. Such policies and procedures, and amendments
thereto, shall be consistent with the City Charter and the Codified Ordinances.
   (q)   On an annual basis, the Director of Finance will submit a report to
the Council Finance Committee that identifies the total credit card usage by
department and total rebates received for use of the cards.

   (b)   Provisions.
      (1)   Scope. All interim deposits of the city as may be prescribed by the
Director of Finance, except as otherwise hereinafter provided, may be invested
by the Director of Finance or his or her designee in the eligible investments
described in division (c) hereof, which eligible investments shall be purchased
only through or from eligible depositories designated pursuant to the Uniform
Depository Act or a qualified securities dealer as defined in division (a)
hereof. However, interim deposits held by a trustee or escrow agent under a
trust agreement, trust indenture or escrow agreement between the city and such
trustee or escrow agent in connection with, or related to, an issue of bonds,
notes or other obligations of the city may be invested in any investments
permitted by such trust agreement, trust indenture or escrow agreement or as
are approved by the rating agency or rating agencies rating such bonds, notes
or other obligations, or interim deposits specifically exempted by ordinance
from this division (b) may be invested as permitted in such ordinance or other
ordinance related to such interim deposits. The Director of Finance is
authorized to pool cash balances of the several funds of the city for
investment hereunder.
      (2)   Objectives. The achievement of sound fiscal management for the city
requires effective investment of the interim deposits of the city. To that
effect, the following investment objectives shall be applied in the investment
of interim deposits.
         A.   Safety. The primary objective of the city’s investment policy is
the preservation of capital and the protection of investment principal. Subject
to the provisions of division (b)(3)B. hereof, each investment transaction
shall seek to first ensure that capital losses measured against the investment
portfolio as a whole are avoided, whether they be from securities’ defaults or
the erosion of market value.
         B.   Liquidity. The city’s investments shall remain sufficiently
liquid to enable the city to meet its operating requirements that might
reasonably be anticipated.
         C.   Yield. In the investment of the interim deposits of the city, the
Director of Finance and any designee of the Director of Finance as permitted
hereunder shall strive to attain a market-average rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the city’s investment risk
constraints and the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio, but shall avoid
assuming unreasonable investment risks. Yield as an objective of this policy is
of least importance compared to safety and liquidity.
      (3)   Minimizing investment risk. The city acknowledges that investment
risk can result from a default by the issuer of the investment, changes in the
market price of the investment or technical complications leading to temporary
illiquidity of an investment. The following investment limitations are directed
at minimizing the effect of such investment risks:
         A.   To minimize the risk of default by the issuer of the investment:
            1.   Interim deposits of the city shall be invested only in
eligible investments permitted under division (c) hereof, except as otherwise
permitted under division (b)(1) hereof.
            2.   No more than 20% of the city’s interim deposits shall be
invested in the aggregate of the eligible investments described in divisions
(c)(1)C. and D. hereof (excluding bonds, notes and other obligations of the
city).
            3.   The Finance Director shall determine appropriate maximum
allocations of the city’s interim deposits available to be invested in the
aggregate of the eligible investments described in divisions (c)(1)E. and J.
hereof.
            4.   No more than 55% of the city's interim deposits shall be
invested in the aggregate of the eligible investments described in divisions
(c)(1)G., H. and I. hereof.
            5.   No interim deposits of the city shall be invested in any
derivative security, reverse repurchase agreement or investment pool or, except
as otherwise provided in this section, in any stripped principal or interest
obligation of any eligible investment.
            6.   The use of leveraging by the city solely as a speculative
investment strategy is prohibited under this investment policy. As used herein,
LEVERAGING shall mean the use of any of the city’s current assets as collateral
for the purpose of purchasing other assets.
            7.   The issuance of taxable notes by the city solely for the
purpose of arbitrating their proceeds is prohibited under this investment
policy.
            8.   Contracting for the sale of securities that have not yet been
acquired by the city for the purpose of purchasing such securities at a later
date on the speculation that their price will decline is prohibited under this
investment policy.
         B.   To minimize the risk of changes in the market price of an
eligible investment:
            1.   Any eligible investment made pursuant to this section with the
exception of eligible investments described in divisions (c)(1)C. and D. hereof
shall mature within five years from the date of settlement unless the eligible
investment is matched to a specific obligation or debt of the city; provided,
however, that no investment shall be made in any eligible investment hereunder
unless the Director of Finance or the authorized designee of such Director of
Finance reasonably expects that the eligible investment can be held until its
maturity and, with respect to any investment of the city’s interim deposits in
the Ohio Subdivision’s Fund created pursuant to R.C. § 135.45, the limitation
of this division (b) shall not be construed as restricting the maturity date of
any individual asset in which the Fund shall invest;
            2.   If at any time the city has no eligible investments maturing
within the next succeeding two calendar months from such time, and at such time
the Director of Finance reasonably expects that a portion of such eligible
investments may have to be liquidated to pay the costs of operating the city at
some time during such next succeeding two calendar months, any additional
interim deposits coming into the custody of the Director of Finance or such
Director’s designee, to the extent the Director of Finance or the Director’s
designee reasonably expects such interim deposits to be needed to pay the costs
of operating the city during such two calendar months, shall be invested only
in short-term eligible investments with a maturity that will allow the Director
of Finance or the Director’s designee to have available (without the need for
sale of such eligible investments in the secondary market) the proceeds of such
eligible investments at such a time that such proceeds can be timely applied to
meeting such operating expenses of the city; and
            3.   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in
division (b)(2)A. or (b)(3)B. hereof shall be construed to prohibit such
Director of Finance or such designee from selling such eligible investment
prior to its maturity, or to impose liability on such Director of Finance or
such designee for any loss occasioned by the sale of any eligible investment
otherwise made in accordance with this section at a price or prices lower than
its cost or balance, if the liquidity needs of the city required such a sale or
if the yield on the reinvestment of the sale proceeds of such eligible
investment, after taking into account the loss incurred in connection with such
sale, will exceed the yield that the city otherwise would have earned if it had
held the original eligible investment to the earlier of its maturity date or
the maturity date of the eligible investment purchased with such sale proceeds.
      (4)   Standard of care. Investment of the interim deposits of the city
shall be made with the exercise of that degree of judgment and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, that persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital as well as the probable income to be derived. The foregoing standard
shall be applied to the investment portfolio of the city as a whole.
      (5)   Authority to invest interim deposits. The Director of Finance is
hereby authorized and directed to invest the interim deposits of the city in
accordance with the provisions of this section. The Director of Finance may
delegate the authority to invest the interim deposits of the city hereunder to
another employee or employees of the city, provided that any such delegation
shall be in a writing that shall be filed with the Mayor, and such a delegation
shall be effective for all purposes of this section unless the Mayor
disapproves such a delegation within ten days of receipt of such written
delegation. Such a delegation may be for a limited or unlimited period of time;
provided that, if such delegation is for an unlimited period of time,
revocation of such delegation shall be effective only if made in a written
instrument signed by the Director of Finance and termination of the employment
by the city of such employee shall automatically terminate such employee’s
authority to invest the interim deposits of the city hereunder without the need
for a written instrument.
      (6)   Conflicts of interest.
         A.   Officers and employees of the city involved in making investment
decisions shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict
with the proper execution and management of the investment program of the city,
or that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions regarding the
city’s investments, and from undertaking personal investment transactions with
the same individual or company with whom business is conducted on behalf of the
city, unless, with respect to the preceding item, such officer and employee
shall disclose in a writing filed with the Council of the city that such
officer or employee has undertaken, is undertaking and/or will undertake
personal investment transactions with the same individual or company, whose
name shall be set forth in the filing, with whom business is conducted on
behalf of the city and such an undertaking would not constitute a violation of
R.C. § 102.03 or 2921.42.
         B.   Officers and employees of the city involved in making investment
decisions shall disclose to the Council of the city any material interests in
eligible institutions or qualified securities dealers with which they conduct
investment business on behalf of the city, and any personal investment
positions that could materially affect, or be materially affected by, the
performance of the investment portfolio of the city.
      (7)   Periodic reports with respect to eligible investments. The Director
of Finance shall prepare at least quarterly an investment report, including a
management summary, describing the investment portfolio at the end of the
quarterly or other period, details of compliance metrics, the transactions made
over such period, and the performance of the investment portfolio relative to
an appropriate benchmark as determined by the Director of Finance. Such report
shall include a list by maturity date of all eligible investments (including,
without limitation, a description of the obligation or security that includes
the type, original cost, par value, maturity date, coupon interest rate and
yield to maturity) for the period covered by such report and held at the end of
such period; and the percentage of the total portfolio that each type of
investment represents. A copy of such report shall be delivered to the Council
and the Mayor.
      (8)   Authorized purchasers and sellers of eligible investments.
Purchases and sales of eligible investments hereunder shall be made only from
or to, as the case may be, an eligible depository or a qualified securities
dealer, which in either case has acknowledged to the city in writing that, in
the case of such a party that initiates investment transactions with the city,
it has received a copy of this section, and it will not sell to the city any
investment security prohibited hereunder or not included as an eligible
investment within the investment securities described in division (c) hereof
or, in the case of such a party that executes investment transactions initiated
by the city, it has received a copy of this section and it comprehends the
investment policy stated herein. The Director of Finance shall biannually
review the financial condition and registration of each eligible depository and
qualified securities dealer with or through whom the interim deposits of the
city are invested.
      (9)   Purchases and sales of eligible investments by the city. The
Director of Finance, or such Director of Finance’s designee, shall purchase an
eligible investment hereunder for cash at a price not in excess of the current
market price, which price shall be deemed to be the best price as determined
hereunder and shall sell any eligible investments for cash and for a sum not
less than their current market price, which price shall be deemed to be the
best price as determined hereunder. Except as otherwise provided in division
(b)(10)B. hereof, with respect to an overnight repurchase agreement, all
purchases and sales of eligible investments hereunder shall be made only on a
delivery versus payment basis. With respect to the purchase or sale of any
eligible investment other than the eligible investments described in divisions
(c)(1)I. and J. hereof, the Director of Finance or such Director of Finance’s
designee, subject to the provisions of division (b)(8) hereof and except as
otherwise provided in this division (b)(9), shall purchase or sell any eligible
investment at the best price based upon at least two bids if the eligible
investment is offered as such from any of the parties described in division (b)
(8) hereof. If there is no readily available competitive offering on the same
specific eligible investment, then the Director of Finance shall document
quotations for comparable or alternative eligible investments. When purchasing
original issue instrumentality securities, no competitive offerings will be
required as all dealers in the selling group offer those securities at the same
original issue price. As used in the immediately preceding sentence, in
connection with any purchase of an eligible investment, the BEST PRICE shall
mean that price which produces the highest yield to maturity with respect to
such eligible investment and, in connection with the sale of an eligible
investment, the “best price” shall mean the highest price with respect to such
eligible investment; provided, however, that in any case where there are two or
more bids at the best price, the Director of Finance or such Director of
Finance’s designee may, in his or her absolute discretion, determine which of
such bids constitutes the best price. The Director of Finance or his or her
designee shall keep a written record of the bids taken with respect to each
purchase or sale of an eligible investment. If the city utilizes the services
of an investment advisor and grants such investment advisor the authority to
execute investment transactions on behalf of the city, then the investment
advisor will retain documentation of the competitive pricing execution on each
transaction and will provide such documentation upon request.
      (10)   Registration, custody and safekeeping of eligible investments.
         A.   If any eligible investments purchased pursuant to this section
are to be issued to a designated payee or to the order of a designated payee,
the name of the Director of Finance and the title of his or her office shall be
so designated. If any such eligible investments are registrable either as to
principal or interest, or both, then such eligible investments shall be
registered in the name of the Director of Finance as such.
         B.   With respect to each eligible investment, the Director of Finance
shall obtain a document evidencing, in the case of a book-entry security, and
confirming, in the case of a certificated security held by other than the
Director of Finance, each such investment. The Director of Finance is
responsible for the safekeeping of all eligible investments and documents
evidencing such eligible investments acquired by the Director of Finance. All
eligible investments acquired as investments under this section by the Director
of Finance on behalf of the city, whether in certificated or book-entry form,
may be held on behalf of the city by a qualified trustee. Such qualified
trustee shall provide to the Director of Finance a copy of each document
evidencing or confirming such eligible investments which such qualified trustee
receives and shall be required to report to the Director of Finance or to the
Auditor of the state or a duly authorized independent auditor of the city at
any time upon request of such party the identity and location of the document
evidencing each eligible investment made hereunder and held by such qualified
trustee. In lieu of such custody, such eligible investments or documents
evidencing or confirming such eligible investments may be held in a safe or
other secure place at the office of the Director of Finance. With respect to
any repurchase agreement that matures on the business day that immediately
succeeds the business day on which such repurchase agreement was entered into,
if the participating institution is a designated depository of the city for the
current period of designation, the securities that are the subject of the
repurchase agreement may be held in trust by the participating institution on
behalf of the city, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this division
(b)(10)B.
      (11)   Internal controls with respect to eligible investments. The
Director of Finance shall establish and maintain an internal control structure
designed to ensure that the assets of the city are protected against theft,
loss or misuse, and in connection therewith, shall maintain written procedures
relating to such internal control.
      (12)   Exemptions from this policy and general law.
         A.   Any investment of interim deposits which, on the effective date
of this section, does not qualify as an eligible investment under this section
(each an “ineligible investment”) may, notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, be held until the first to occur of either its maturity or its sale;
provided, however, that if the investment does not have a maturity date, it may
be held no later than five years from the effective date of this section. The
proceeds of any sale of an ineligible investment shall be reinvested, if at
all, only in an eligible investment.
         B.   The city and th e Director of Finance, any designee of the
Director of Finance pursuant to this section, and any other official of the
city, being governed by a charter adopted under Article XVIII of the Ohio
Constitution, and special provisions regarding the investment of the city’s
interim deposits having been made through the passage of this section, are
hereby exempted, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, from the
provisions of the general laws of the state, including, without limitation, the
Uniform Depository Act, applicable to the investment of the interim deposits of
the city.
      (13)   Annual review of policy amendments. This section shall be reviewed
on an annual basis by the Director of Finance and the Finance Committee of
Council to determine if amendments to this section are required in order to
further the best interests of the city in connection with the management of its
investment portfolio.
   (c)   Eligible investments.

day on which such repurchase agreement was entered into shall be at least 102%
of the principal amount of the repurchase agreement, and on any other business
day after the business day described in the immediately preceding item, shall
be at least 102% of the principal amount of the repurchase agreement. Further,
the repurchase agreement shall contain the requirement that for each
transaction pursuant to such agreement the eligible depository or qualified
securities dealer shall provide all of the following information: the par value
of the securities subject to such agreement; the type, coupon rate, if any, and
maturity date of the securities; and a numerical identifier generally accepted

division (c)(1) hereof at prices lower than its cost or balance. Any loss or
expense in making such sale shall be payable as other expenses of the city.
      (3)   The members of Council, the Mayor, and the Director of Finance and

provisions of this section, with respect to their reinvestment, and the Uniform
Depository Act, with respect to their deposit.

employee, provided that such employee has worked a minimum of 1,040 hours in
the preceding 12 months of his or her anniversary date.
   (b)   Calculation of prior service. For purposes of computing an employee’s

exceed the years of prior similar service, either public or private, to newly
hired department heads with the title of Director or Chief. Independent

Mayor and Finance Department before such vacation time is added to the
employee’s vacation entitlement.
      (2)   In instances where full-time employees had prior service credit
with the city on a part-time basis, credit shall be given for such part-time
service with the city based upon the number of hours actually worked as a part-
time employee in relation to 2,080 hours for a full year of credit.

         B.   If an employee was not paid for a full year prior to his or her
vacation anniversary date, and was on unpaid leave of absence, he or she shall
not earn or accrue vacation time during their unpaid leave. An employee that
has unpaid leave shall have his or her vacation entitlement adjusted
accordingly on his or her following vacation anniversary date only, and not
future vacation anniversary dates following a fully paid year.
      (2)   The Mayor may, however, grant vacation time to a newly hired
department head to be used between the date of hire and the date the new

annual complement of vacation time under the existing vacation system. The
amount of vacation time granted to the new department head for this purpose

employment with the city for any reason except disciplinary discharge, each
full-time employee of the city shall be entitled to payment for unused and

§ 260.08 SICK LEAVE.
   (a)   Sick leave credit generally. Each full-time employee and individuals
in part-time positions who are currently receiving sick time and hired prior to
February 1, 2012, shall accrue, for each 80 hours of service, a sick leave
credit in the amount of four and six-tenths hours with pay. The use of such
credit shall be permitted for any of the following: personal illness;
pregnancy; injury; exposure to contagious disease and/or illness or injury in
the employee’s immediate family.
   (b)   Immediate family defined. For the purpose of this section, IMMEDIATE
FAMILY shall be defined as follows: an employee’s children or the employee’s
spouse, step-children, parents or children of employees designated as legal
guardians. Proof of such relationship may be required by the city.
   (c)   Accumulation and use of sick leave credit. Sick leave credit shall be
cumulative, limited as noted herein. When sick leave is used, it shall be
deducted from the employee’s accrued balance on an hour-for-hour basis for
every hour of absence from previously scheduled work, except that absence from
previously scheduled work because of death in the immediate family, with the
approval of the department head, not exceeding three days, shall not be so
deducted. The appointing authority and/or the department head for each
employing unit may require an employee to furnish satisfactory documentation
upon request to justify the use of sick leave by an employee. However, in all
instances where medical attention was required or when an absence is for three
or more consecutive scheduled work days, the employee may be required to
furnish written documentation stating the nature of the illness or injury to
justify the use of sick leave. Falsification of any such documentation, or
falsely using sick leave, shall be grounds for disciplinary action, including
dismissal.
   (d)   Temporary disability. In the event that an employee is temporarily
disabled and uses all of his or her accumulated sick leave, said employee may
request that the city continue to provide group hospitalization coverage for
the duration of said disability. Such request shall be made in writing to the
Mayor for consideration by the Council Finance Committee.
   (e)   Prior service; sick leave credit. Previously accumulated and unused
sick leave credit of an employee who has been separated from public service
shall be placed to his or her credit upon re-employment in public service,
provided that such re-employment takes place within ten years from the date of
separation. Newly hired employees with prior service from other governmental
agencies shall be allowed to transfer 40 hours of sick leave to Solon and those
hours shall not be subject to payment to the employee in the event of
retirement as defined in division (h) below.
   (f)   Certain employees excluded. All part-time employees not included in
division (a) above, temporary, and seasonal employees, or those rendering
intermittent or per diem service, shall be excluded from the benefits of this
section.
   (g)   Compensation for unused, accumulated sick leave. Upon the retirement
or death of an eligible employee, the employee, or his or her spouse and/or
legal representative shall, upon written notification to the city, be entitled
to a lump sum payment for the accumulated and unused sick leave credit subject
to the limits as detailed in this chapter. For the purposes of this section, an
employee shall be deemed to be retired when he or she applies for and obtains a
retirement pension under pension plans afforded employees as a result of their
public employment. When giving the city written notification, the employee
shall request payment either immediately after retirement or at a later date
within one year after retirement. In either case, only one payment will be
made. If the employee elects payment at a later date, it will be at the hourly
rate at retirement and no interest earnings will be accrued or added to the
payment.
   (h)   Limits on payment of unused; accumulated sick leave credit. In the
event of the retirement or death of an employee, payment of accumulated and
unused sick leave credit shall be determined as follows.
      (1)   Employees hired prior to January 1, 1989, shall be paid for the
first 960 hours of accumulated and unused sick leave credit on an hour-for-hour
basis. All sick leave credit in excess of 960 hours shall be paid on the basis
of one hour for every three hours accumulated and unused.
      (2)   Employees hired on or after January 1, 1989, shall be paid for the
first 500 hours of accumulated and unused sick leave credit on an hour-for-hour
basis. All sick leave credit in excess of 500 hours shall be paid on the basis
of one hour for every four hours accumulated and unused.
   (i)   Sick leave credit; cash conversion option. On or before December 15,
and each year thereafter, a full-time employee of the city credited with sick
leave credit up to a maximum of 120 hours per calendar year may elect to
convert such credit into a cash benefit, or carry forward such credit to his or
her balance. The conditions for the cash conversion shall be as follows.
      (1)   An employee must have at least 360 hours of sick leave credit at
the end of each calendar year, exclusive of the 120 hours of sick leave credit
earned for the current year in which the election is made.
      (2)   An employee may convert all sick leave credit earned and unused
during a calendar year of election to a cash benefit at the rate of three-
eighths, payable at the employee’s current hourly rate in the year earned,
excluding longevity, differentials, bonuses, premium payments, regularly
scheduled overtime and all other forms of additional or supplemental
compensation. Absent such an election by an employee, the sick leave credit
earned and unused in a calendar year will be added to the total accrued sick
leave credit balance of the employee.
   (j)   Voluntary sick leave donations. In the event an employee has exhausted
his or her accumulated sick leave due to an extended use as described in
division (a) hereof, the Mayor may approve the transfer of sick leave to this
employee from other employees who wish to voluntarily donate a portion of his
or her unused accumulated sick leave. A list with the donor’s name, the number
of hours donated and the donor’s signature shall be presented to the Mayor for
his or her approval and forwarded to the Finance Department. Employees may
donate no less than eight hours and up to a maximum of 40 hours per employee
per a 12-month period. The donated sick leave shall be proportionately applied
and any unused sick leave shall be returned proportionately to the donating
employees once the employee that received the donations has returned to work.

normal pay. Such compensation shall be determined as follows.
   (a)   Eligibility. Employees hired prior to January 1, 1989, shall be
entitled to longevity pay which shall be calculated as an additional 0.5% of
the base salary for each full year of service. Employees hired on or after
January 1, 1989, shall be entitled to longevity pay which shall be calculated
as an additional 0.25% of the base salary for each full year of service. For
employees hired after December 31, 1986, the payment of longevity shall begin
on January 1 following five full years of service.
   (b)   Years of service. Full years of service shall be calculated on the
employee’s anniversary date of hire year and the compensation shall be adjusted
to reflect any increased amount on the first pay following January 1, 1998,
using the salary in effect at that time, and each subsequent January 1. An
employee shall be credited for time served during his or her probationary
period for purposes of calculating longevity pay. With the exception of allowed
absences, including vacation, holidays, sick leave, disciplinary suspension and
authorized leaves of absence, any other absences shall be deemed a termination
of an employee’s eligibility for the purposes of determining his or her
eligibility for longevity.
   (c)   Maximum allowable compensation. For employees hired prior to January
1, 1989, the maximum longevity pay shall be 10%. For employees hired on or
after January 1, 1989, the maximum longevity pay shall be 5%.

TITLE TEN - JUDICIARY
            Chap.
298.   Mayor’s Court
CHAPTER 298: MAYOR’S COURT
Editor’s note:
   R.C. § 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Solon has jurisdiction to hear and
determine any prosecution for the violation of a Solon ordinance, and has
jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations
occurring on state highways located within the corporate limits of Solon,
subject to the limitations of R.C. §§ 2937.08 and 2938.04. In keeping his or
her docket and file, the Mayor shall be governed by the laws pertaining to
county courts.
   R.C. § 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor’s Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him or her unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such
event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate
shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court
of record in Cuyahoga County (the Bedford Municipal Court) and the magistrate
shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together with a transcript of
proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance, if given, to the
court of record.
    However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that
in petty offense cases, where there is a right to jury trial, the defendant
shall be tried by the court unless he or she demands a jury trial. The
jurisdiction of a Mayor’s Court, in such cases, is further limited by Rule 9 of
the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if a jury demand is not made
pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his or her right to jury
trial in writing, a Mayor may try the case only if (1) his or her compensation
as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case convictions, or (2) he
or she is not the chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any Mayor.
   R.C. §§ 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall be
claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the clerk
of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for trial
or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for trial,
whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes R.C. § 2938.04, provides that right
to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and
filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. R.C. § 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in R.C. § 2937.08. R.C. § 2945.17 provides that an accused has a
right to be tried by a jury at any trial in any court for the violation of any
Ohio statute or of any Solon ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty
involved does not exceed a fine of $100.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas, the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1976. Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor’s Courts were authorized to
suspend the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or §
434.01 of the Traffic Code (OVI), in accordance with R.C. § 4507.16(B).

(R.C. § 4549.081(C))
§ 414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs or traffic-control signals shall be erected at all
intersections with such through highways by the Department of Transportation as
to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities as to highways
under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. Where
two or more state routes that are through highways intersect, and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. Whenever the
Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an engineering and
traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop traffic on a
through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this section shall
be construed to prevent the installations. When circumstances warrant, the
Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through highways
under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes a
stop sign under this division (a), he or she shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30 days before
installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
municipality may by ordinance designate the street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division (b) intersect and no
traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting the through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(R.C. § 4511.65)
§ 414.03 TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings.
   (a)   Steady green signal indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a U-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal indication
or other traffic-control device. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles
turning right or left or making a U-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way
to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk; and
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a U-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a U-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk; and
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic-control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady yellow signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic- control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2) and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic-control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic-control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic-control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing green signal indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing yellow signal indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a U-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic- control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a U-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk; and
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a U-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a U-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk; and
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a U-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic-control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic-control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic-
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic-control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic-control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic-control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic-control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   Official traffic-control signal at a place other than an intersection.
In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a
place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be
applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no
application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the
pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any
such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Railroad grade crossings. This section does not apply at railroad
grade crossings. Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade
crossings shall be governed by R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

§ 414.04 SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows.
   (a)   A steady downward green arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A steady yellow “X.” A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A steady red “X.” A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall

left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient
distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be completely made
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every event, the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable, and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for the
traffic approaching from the opposite direction, before coming within 200 feet

R.C. § 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent or municipal ordinance, the
court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than $500. The court

the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall impose

under division (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom division
(d)(1)A. of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of $150 under
division (d)(1)A. of this section and the assessment of points under division
(d)(4) of this section, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted
driving safety course, as described in R.C. § 4511.991. If the offender attends
and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall not be required to pay the fine and shall not have the points assessed
against that offender’s driver’s license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (a) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a
dismissal of the charges for the violation, and the violation is a prior
offense under divisions (d)(1)B. and (d)(1)C. of this section if the offender
commits a subsequent violation or violations of division (a) of this section
within two years of the offense for which the course was completed. This
division does not apply with respect to any offender in the category of
offenders to whom division (d)(1)B., (d)(1)C., or (d)(1)D. of this section

be assessed for a violation of division (a) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for purposes of enforcing this section

specified by rule in the person’s urine, in the person’s whole blood, or in the
person’s blood serum or plasma.
      (2)   No person who, within 20 years of the conduct described in division
(a)(2)A. of this section, previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to
a violation of this division or a substantially equivalent State law or
municipal ordinance, division (a)(1) of this section or a substantially
equivalent State law or municipal ordinance, or shall do both of the following:
         A.   Operate any vehicle within this municipality while under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them; and
         B.   Subsequent to being arrested for operating the vehicle as
described in division (a)(2)A. of this section, being asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and being advised by the
officer in accordance with R.C. § 4511.192 or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance of the consequences of the person’s refusal or submission
to the test or tests, refuse to submit to the test or tests.
   (b)   Underage alcohol consumption. No person under 21 years of age shall
operate any vehicle within this municipality if, at the time of the operation,
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.02% but less than
0.08% by weight per unit volume of alcohol in the person’s whole blood;
      (2)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.03% but less than
0.096% by weight per unit volume of alcohol in the person’s blood serum or
plasma;
      (3)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.02 grams but less than
0.08 grams by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of the person’s breath; and
      (4)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.028 grams but less
than 0.11 grams by weight of alcohol per 100 milliliters of the person’s urine.
   (c)   Prosecution; limitation on convictions. In any proceeding arising out
of one incident, a person may be charged with a violation of division (a)(1)A.
or (a)(2) and a violation of division (b)(1), (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section,
but the person may not be convicted of more than one violation of these
divisions.
   (d)   Evidence; tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in R.C. § 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine or
other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division (d)
(1)B. regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-
hour time limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time
during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in
that section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol,
drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division (d)(1)
B. when a person submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement
officer under R.C. § 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.
Only a physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-
intermediate, an emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the
purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the whole blood, blood serum or
blood plasma. This limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division (d)(1)B.
may refuse to withdraw blood under this division (d)(1)B., if in that person’s
opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the
withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance withdrawn under this division (d)
(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of
Health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director
pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, EMERGENCY MEDICAL
TECHNICIAN-INTERMEDIATE and EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN-PARAMEDIC have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division (d)(2) does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician,
chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical test
or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and (d)(4)C. of this section,
NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. §
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has administered
a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in the violation
and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the officer
administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing standards for
any reliable, credible and generally accepted field sobriety tests that were in
effect at the time the tests were administered, including but not limited to
any testing standards then in effect that were set by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered;
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding; and
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or (d)(4)B.2. of this section and if the testimony or
evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the
testimony or evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the
trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   Laboratory report.
      (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division (e)
(1) that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this division (e)(1) shall be admitted as prima facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties; and
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   Limitation of liability.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(1), any
physician, registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate,
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist or
phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or R.C.
§ 4511.19, 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station or clinic
at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or R.C. §
4511.19, 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil
liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is
not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division (f)(1) also extends to an
emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this division (f)(1) is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or
wanton misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN-
INTERMEDIATE and EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN-PARAMEDIC have the same meanings
as in R.C. § 4765.01.
(R.C. § 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied consent.
      (1)   Definitions. For the purpose of this division (g), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         A.   ALCOHOL MONITORING DEVICE. Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   COMMUNITY ADDICTION SERVICES PROVIDER. Has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   PHYSICAL CONTROL. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine to
determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   Tests at request of law enforcement agent. The chemical test or
tests under division (g)(2) of this section shall be administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the
person was operating or in physical control of a vehicle in violation of a
division, section or ordinance identified in division (g)(2) of this section.
The law enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate
which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to R.C. §§
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if convicted would
be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)
(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request pursuant
to this division (g)(5)A. that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division (g)
(5)A..
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division (g)(5)B. to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division (g)(6) to any person under arrest for a violation of
division (a), (b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
"You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state law
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
“If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I. or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state O.V.I., and,
if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) “If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
         “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical
test taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) of this section or division (g)(6) of this section to submit to a
chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, the arresting
officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to the court in
which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is
not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest,
and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or
permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon
receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
      (9)   Duties of officer.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath
or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement officer
asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this section to
submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change; and
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. §
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense; and
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of
the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance or a
metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is present
in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first-class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest, provided
the report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is
sworn to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48
hours after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy
of the sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on
the charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197
relative to any suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from the
arrest covered by the report.
(R.C. § 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person’s
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person’s being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B),
or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control of a
vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or R.C. § 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) or

within 60 days of sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the term, the offender will not be able
to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing, the court may impose an alternative sentence as specified in R.C. §

addition to or independent of any other penalty established by law, the court
may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of
the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so
imposed shall be distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that
section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial

limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under R.C. §§ 4510.021
and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition
interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of

driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended
under this section or R.C. § 4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of
the person’s trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay the operation
of the suspension.

section does not apply to a person who operates a vehicle while the person has
a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a

prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs; and
      (2)   The person injected, ingested or inhaled the controlled substance
in accordance with the health professional’s directions.

controlled substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance listed in
division (a)(1)J. of this section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of
R.C. § 2923.16(D) in the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for
a prohibited concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   Applicability of terms. All terms defined in R.C. § 4510.01 apply to
this section. If the meaning of a term defined in R.C. § 4510.01 conflicts with
the meaning of the same term as defined in R.C. § 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term
as defined in R.C. § 4510.01 applies to this section.

in the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible and generally acceptable field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered;

court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (o)(3)A. of this section.
      (4)   Penalty. Whoever violates this division (o) is guilty of having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. In addition to other sanctions imposed, the court may impose on

commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license
or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02

lines, except when those boundaries are extended as provided in divisions (b)
(1)A. and (b)(1)C. of this section.
         E.   As used in this division (b)(1), CROSSWALK has the meaning given
that term in R.C. § 4511.01(LL)(2).
         F.   The Director may, upon request by resolution of the legislative
authority and upon submission by the municipality of such engineering, traffic
and other information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school

responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under division

shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license on
or about the person’s person shall be prima facie evidence of the person’s not
having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.

been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section,
R.C. § 4507.35, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense
is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

§ 436.07 DRIVING UNDER SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OR WITHOUT PROOF OF FINANCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY OR IN VIOLATION OF LICENSE RESTRICTIONS (REPEALED).
Editor’s note:
   Section 436.07 was repealed as part of the 2003 updating and revision of

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth and Social Security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(2) of this section. The
person charged with a violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section

of or pleaded guilty to two violations of this section, or any combination of
two violations of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or of a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, the court, in addition to any other

responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from
the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

evidence as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of
this section. The person charged with a violation of division (b)(1) or (b)(2)
of this section may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of
driving under suspension and shall be punished as provided in division (b)(3)A.

2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
         B.   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
or (b)(2) of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of
division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16,
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor

three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days of jail time
imposed pursuant to this division (c).
(R.C. § 4510.037(J))

brought under this section that the alleged offender drove under suspension,
without a valid permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in
violation of a restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no
other person was reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.
(R.C. § 4510.04)

vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the

the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s or
commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth and Social Security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of

division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows.
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division (c)(1), the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.

to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to

division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action
that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.
Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car; and
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

§ 440.01 LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with R.C. §§ 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
          B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under R.C. § 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed a
nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(R.C. § 4513.34)
   (b)   Violations. Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of
a minor misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.99)
   (c)   Local streets. No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as

R.C. §§ 4513.01 through 4513.37, or exceeding a gross weight of five tons, upon
any street in the municipality other than state routes and county roads, except
those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as such by
appropriate traffic signs, and except when the operation is necessary to load
or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of the vehicle
or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage through
the municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a state route
or a designated truck route within the municipality shall confine the deviation
to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the departure. On county
roads, Council or other duly designated local authority shall establish
reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and material
specifications for the roads and the load resistance of the roads as determined
by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs indicating the
weight limits.
   (d)   Local permit and conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for the vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge $25, and for
each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the Police Department in
supervising the movement of the vehicle, the applicant shall pay the sum of
$50.
   (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section, streets
and highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks - gross
weight five tons” or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of the permit and denial of request for any future permit. This
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by §§
408.01 and
408.02.

upon the surface of that sign or affixed next to the designating sign a notice
that states the fine applicable for the offense of parking a motor vehicle in
the designated accessible parking location if the motor vehicle is not legally
entitled to be parked in that location.
   (f)   (1)   A.   No person shall stop, stand or park any motor vehicle at
accessible parking locations provided under division (e) of this section, or at

or
            2.   The motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of
a person with a disability and is displaying a parking card or accessible
license plates.
         B.   Any motor vehicle that is parked in an accessible marked parking
location in violation of division (f)(1)A.1. or (f)(1)A.2. of this section may
be towed or otherwise removed from the parking location by the law enforcement

municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor vehicle is a
leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the lessee
presents proof that that person is the lessee of the motor vehicle and pays all
towing and storage fees normally imposed by the municipality for towing and
storing motor vehicles.

was issued the ticket or citation and that, because of the injury, the person
meets at least one of the criteria contained in R.C. § 4503.44(A)(1).
      (2)   No person shall stop, stand, or park any motor vehicle in an area
that is commonly known as an access aisle, which area is marked by diagonal

provided under division (e) of this section or at an accessible clearly marked
parking location provided in or on a privately owned parking lot, parking
garage, or other parking area and designated in accordance with that division.

person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk and is
displaying a removable windshield placard or accessible license plates, or when
a motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a person with a
disability and is displaying a parking card or accessible license plates, the

legal parking period permitted by local authorities, except where local
ordinances or police rules provide otherwise or where the vehicle is parked in
such a manner as to be clearly a traffic hazard.
   (h)   No owner of an office, facility or parking garage where accessible
parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with division (e)
of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking locations in
accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of the
accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed or
movable signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or
organization to apply for a removable windshield placard or accessible license
plates if the parking card or accessible license plates issued to the person or
organization under prior law have not expired or been surrendered or revoked.

privilege, or made in connection with the person’s appearance as a witness.
         D.   The Clerk of the Court shall pay every fine collected under

provided in division (k)(2) of this section, the municipality shall use the
fine monies it receives under divisions (k)(2) and (k)(3) of this section to
pay the expenses it incurs in complying with the signage and notice
requirements contained in division (e) of this section. The municipality may

(R.C. § 4511.69)
§ 452.05 WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The Police Chief, upon notification to the Police Chief of such action
and of the location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor
vehicle, including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. §
4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Police chief as a result of the
performance of the Police Chief's duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when
such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered
into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the Police Chief shall allow the owner or operator of
the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle
within a period of time specified by the Police Chief. If the Police Chief
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the Police Chief shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the Police Chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the Police Chief issues an order under division (a) of this section
and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by a towing service, the towing
service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated by the
Police Chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed.
   (c)   (1)   The Police Chief shall cause a search to be made of the records
of an applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into
storage by the Police Chief within five business days of the removal of the
vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Police Chief shall send or cause to
be sent to the owner and any lienholder at the owner's and any lienholder's
last known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested,
by certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner and any lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible
for payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage and
may reclaim the motor vehicle upon payment of those expenses or charges, and
presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a certificate of
title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of
registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle
also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without retrieving the
vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Police Chief to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, "personal items"
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Police Chief, without charge
to any party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the
place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the
requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk,
without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances, to the Police Chief. If the vehicle is to be
disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in
R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Police
Chief shall execute in triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar
of Motor Vehicles, describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was
disposed of, and that all requirements of this section have been complied with.
The Police Chief shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Police
Chief's records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage
dealer or other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the
motor vehicle salvage dealer, the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.
(R.C. § 4513.64)
§ 452.055 PARKING PROHIBITIONS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY; PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected, may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle

property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a home,
residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three
separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The phrase

structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (b)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been

oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not

      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to

the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders

vehicle's license number, make, model, and color, the location from which it
was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief's order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (a)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as

the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 or, if the vehicle

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for

      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the

(d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
      (4)   For purposes of division (d)(3) of this section, “personal items”

misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.60)
   (h)   Private Tow-away Zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
            2.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.
If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
            3.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times,

            4.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
            5.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may

of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the

without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall

authority of division (h)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

photographs as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on
private property in violation of a private tow-away zone established under

which the vehicle was towed, whichever is earlier.
         B.   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under division (h)
(2) of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more

lienholder under this division shall ensure that such information is provided
in a timely manner.

cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to

conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of

is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.

negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for that element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for that element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for that
element.

      (3)   While out of this municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality;

   (c)   (1)   This municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
municipality for purposes of this section.

need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.

of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

occurred.

(R.C. § 2901.13)
§ 606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing; and
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   CULPABILITY. Purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence, as
defined in R.C. § 2901.22.
      (2)   INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting
from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are INVOLUNTARY ACTS.
      (4)   POSSESSION. A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21)
§ 606.08 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances.
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23)
§ 606.09 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C. §
2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by the organization, if he
or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in that
conduct, or tolerates that conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility; and
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and the duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24)
§ 606.10 FALSIFICATION.

2923.1213; and
      (15)   The statement is required under R.C. § 5743.71 in connection with
the person’s purchase of cigarettes or tobacco products in a delivery sale.
   (b)   No person, in connection with the purchase of a firearm as defined in

   (c)   No person who discovers the body or acquires the first knowledge of
the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or

report required by division (c) of this section was made, or to any law
enforcement officer who has reasonable cause to assert the authority to

relay service call.

immediate family;
      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under R.C. § 2739.04 or 2739.12;

member of the ordained clergy of an organized religious body of a confidential

the clergy.
      (5)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the
actor in the course of the actor's duties in connection with a bona fide
program of treatment or services for persons with drug dependencies or persons
in danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider
whose alcohol and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to R.C. §
5119.36.
      (6)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the
actor in the course of the actor's duties in connection with a bona fide
program for providing counseling services to victims of crimes that are
violations of R.C. § 2907.02 or R.C. § 2907.05 or to victims of felonious
sexual penetration in violation of former R.C. § 2907.12. As used in this
division, "counseling services" include services provided in an informal
setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide
those services.
   (h)   No disclosure of information pursuant to this section gives rise to
any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.

duties.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of obstructing official
business. Except as otherwise provided in this division (b), obstructing

business is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.

regardless of whether the person or child aided ultimately is apprehended for,
is charged with, is convicted of, pleads guilty to or is adjudicated a
delinquent child for committing the crime or act the person or child aided
committed. The crime or act the person or child aided committed shall be used
under division (c) of this section in determining the penalty for violation of

offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).

commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.

or the accused’s attorney. In such a circumstance, the accused person is
entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting attorney, to have the
accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst present at an analysis
of the substance that is, or the substances that are, the basis of the alleged
violation, and, upon further written request, to receive copies of all recorded

basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance
contained any amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests

conduct a bingo session at the premises, or on the day of the week or at the
time specified on its license or if a charitable organization wants to conduct
bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than the day or time
specified on its license, the charitable organization may apply in writing to
the Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(J). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than
the day or time specified on its license. If the amended license is granted,
the organization may conduct bingo sessions at the premises, on the day of the

electronic bingo aid;
            4.   An electronic bingo aid cannot be part of an electronic
network other than a network that includes only bingo aids and devices that are

conducted;

offense or in a violation of R.C. § 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A), 2913.02, 2913.03 or 2913.04,
2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or 2913.31 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the offender in the
offender’s same employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those
offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a series of offenses under
R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance
to any of these offenses, is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall
be tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by
R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved
in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
2913.02, 2913.03 or 2913.04, 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or 2913.31 or 2913.43,
whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a
victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant to a scheme
or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.
If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed against one
victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active duty
service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a scheme
or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.
If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the property or

all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another as described in division (b)(1)
or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that involve
a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or course of
conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is not
necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in order to
prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this
section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to prove
the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the requisite
statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense.
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount which would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
the property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, and the value of services, is
the fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section,
FAIR MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a
seller would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is
willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed
as to all facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any
compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value;
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity;
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products;
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument;
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument;
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument; and
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

§ 642.25 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of §
642.06:
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, FAIR MARKET VALUE has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 2913.61.
   (c)   Prima facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in R.C. §
2913.61(D), may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

control of the meter, conduit or attachment at the time the tampering occurred
has caused the tampering with intent to commit a theft offense.
   (b)   In a prosecution for a theft offense, as defined in R.C. § 2913.01,

the time of the reconnection has reconnected the meter, conduit or attachment
with intent to commit a theft offense.
   (c)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

determination.

      (6)   A.   A qualified retired peace officer who possesses a retired
peace officer identification card issued pursuant to division (b)(6)B. of this
section and a valid firearms requalification certification issued pursuant to
division (b)(6)C. of this section has the same right to carry a concealed

performance of the peace officer’s duties; and
               d.   Before retiring from service as a peace officer with that
agency, the person was regularly employed as a peace officer for an aggregate

            2.   A retired peace officer identification card issued to a person
under division (b)(6)B.1. of this section shall identify the person by name,

         C.   1.   If a person retired from service as a peace officer with a
public agency of this state or of a political subdivision of this state and the
person satisfies the criteria set forth in divisions (b)(6)B.1.a. to (b)
(6)B.1.d. of this section, the public agency may provide the retired peace
officer with
the opportunity to attend a firearms requalification program that is approved
for purposes of firearms requalification required under R.C. § 109.801. The
retired peace officer may be required to pay the cost of the course.
            2.   If a retired peace officer who satisfies the criteria set

firearms requalification program that is approved for purposes of firearms
requalification required under R.C. § 109.801, the retired peace officer’s
successful completion of the firearms requalification program requalifies the

§ 698.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   (a)   DANGEROUS OFFENDER. A person who has committed an offense, whose
history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she will
be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a pattern of
repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences.
   (b)   REPEAT OFFENDER. A person who has a history of persistent criminal
activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or
she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a person is a
REPEAT OFFENDER if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in R.C. § 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for
one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in R.C. § 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for
one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
R.C. § 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or more
of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;

offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(R.C. § 2935.36(E))
§ 698.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender or
religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) to (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days; or
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §§
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56 or
2947.19 and 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section; and
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days; and
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division (b)(5)B. shall commence on the date specified by the court,
provided that the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has
served the jail term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23,
2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, and any residential sanction imposed for the violation under
division (d) of this section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this
division (b)(5)B. shall be considered to be a community control sanction for
purposes of division (c) of this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions
of this Code and the Ohio Revised Code that pertain to community control
sanctions shall apply to a sanction imposed under this division (b)(6)B.,
except to the extent that they would by their nature be clearly inapplicable.
The offender shall pay all costs associated with a sanction imposed under this
division (b)(5)B., including the cost of the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in §§
666.99 and
698.03 of this code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e) or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term; or
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e) or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions; or
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a Department of
Probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender and ensuring the
offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on the
offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also shall
be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e) or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the Department of Probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the Department of Probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction; or
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (c), if an offender,
for a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community
control sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e) or (f) of this section
in an exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the
community control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control
sanction. Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not
relieve the offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this
section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (d)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders; or
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term of up to 60 days in a community alternative sentencing center
or district community alternative sentencing center established and operated in
accordance with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section,
with one of the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully
complete the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family; and/or
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division (d) shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division (e). Nonresidential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         C.   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor of
the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third or fourth
degree;
         D.   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         E.   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         F.   A term of basic probation supervision;
         G.   A term of monitored time;
         H.   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction; or
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division (e)
does not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for
any offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division (e).
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the General Fund of the county,
municipality or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
General Fund of the county, municipality or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
General Fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate General Fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or the victim's estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim's representative, victim's attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor's designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim's costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim's representative, victim's attorney, if applicable, or victim's estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim's estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim's attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim's estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
(f)(1)B.2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by
law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
or
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined; and
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e)
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s General Fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the Fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e)
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the Fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e) or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division (f), the victim, private provider, state or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance; or
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92;
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
§ 698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by R.C. §
1547.99(G), 4510.14(B) or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Revised
Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under this
chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion
to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and principles of
sentencing set forth in §
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of §
666.99 or 698.02 of this code or R.C. §§ 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that
imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the
offender any sanction or combination of sanctions under §
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
(b)(1)C. of this section.
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses; and
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim's representative, the victim's
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22)
§ 698.04 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in §
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
606.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;

served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall

   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 4510.07 or in any other provision of
the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this code of ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender’s driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this code of ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
code of ordinances is substantially equivalent.

providing competitive video service within the geographical boundaries of the
city. The competitive video service provider may enter private property only as
permitted by the owner of such private property for the purpose of

   (c)   Each provider must comply with all local, state and federal laws, if
applicable, and agree in its respective franchise agreement or competitive
video service agreement to comply with the requirements set forth in
Chapter 808 of the Solon Codified Ordinances.
   (d)   Prior to any non-emergency construction, reconstruction, upgrade,
rebuild or any modification or change relating to the providing of service,
which includes any work which:
      (1)   Could result in an interruption of service lasting more than three
hours;
      (2)   Could result in a material hindrance to traffic on the streets
which is reasonably foreseeable;
      (3)   Could interfere with the delivery of any utility service in the
city; or

such plans, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
   (e)   Any provider who constructs or maintains any system necessary for the
providing of service, shall do so in such a manner so as not to interfere with
the use of the streets in the city. Each provider shall make use of existing

notify all affected persons (whether by posting signs, direct mail,
advertisement in newspaper of general circulation, or other means reasonably
calculated to provide general public notice) of proposed construction work at

   (h)   Each provider’s rights are subject to the police powers of the city to
adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to the health, safety and welfare of the

         A.   Shall be installed, located, erected, constructed, reconstructed,
replaced, removed, repaired, maintained and operated in accordance with good
engineering practices; and
         B.   All such work must be performed by experienced maintenance and
construction personnel so as not to endanger or interfere with improvements the
city may deem appropriate to make, interfere in any manner with the rights of
any property owner, or unnecessarily hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular
traffic.
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the provider’s
rights to access and make use of its own or general utility easements in
accordance with the terms of such easements.
   (e)   The provider shall at all times employ ordinary care and shall install
and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices preventing facilities
and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injury or nuisance to the
public.
   (f)   Any and all streets, other public property or private property which
are damaged or disturbed as a result of the construction, installation, repair,
replacement, maintenance or operation of the provider’s facilities shall be
promptly repaired and restored by the provider, at its expense, to a condition
as good as that prevailing prior to said disturbance or damage.
   (g)   If any street or portion thereof is vacated or abandoned by the city
during the term of provider’s agreement, or the provider discontinues the use
of all or part of any street during the term of its agreement, the provider
shall, at provider’s expense, promptly remove the affected portion of the
system. After completing the removal, provider shall repair and reconstruct the
street area where such removal has occurred and restore the street to a

option to complete the removal and restoration. All removal and restoration
costs and expenses incurred by the city shall be deducted from the provider’s
performance bond. Any removal and restoration costs and expenses incurred in
excess of the performance bond shall be the direct and uncontested liability of
the provider. The provider must promptly pay all removal and restoration costs
and expenses in excess of the performance bond upon receiving evidence of same
from the city.

§ 808.07 AREA COVERED/PROVISION OF SERVICE.
   (a)   Service generally. Each provider shall extend their service and make
service available to the dwelling units and places of business in the city
within the time periods and in the manner set forth in each provider’s
respective franchise agreement or competitive video service agreement.
   (b)   Service to schools and public buildings. It is the city’s intention
that each accredited primary and secondary school building, each city
government building, and each public library building within the city be
provided with cable service, IP video service or similar service at no cost,
and that the burden of providing such connections be shared by all cable and IP
video service providers in the city in an equitable manner. The providers will
offer one free installation and free monthly IP video service to one outlet at
each public school, city government building, fire station, police station and
library building that is passed by the provider’s system. The provider shall
have the responsibility to offer a free installation and free monthly IP video
service to a share of such schools, governmental or library buildings. The
provider’s share shall be proportionate to the total number of cable operators
or competitive video service providers unless other negotiated compensation has
been provided to the city. The providers will supply the city with a list
showing the responsibility of who will provide and maintain video or cable
service to which school or public building, within 30 days of the providers’
negotiation for such service.
   (c)   Negotiation. The video service provider shall negotiate with other
providers in good faith, as necessary, to determine who will provide video
service to which school or public building, and the Mayor shall have the right
to participate in such negotiations. If providers are unable to reach agreement
as to who will provide free video service to which school, governmental or
library building, the Mayor, or his or her designee, will confer with the
providers and determine the assignments in a reasonable manner. This obligation
will apply to a new provider of video service once that provider’s video
service is available on the section of its system that passes the school or
public building assigned to that provider. Until such time, the incumbent
provider of video service to that location will provide video service to such
school or public building.
(Ord. 2007-106, passed 5-21-2007)
§ 808.08 EMERGENCY AND SAFETY ALERT MONITOR SYSTEM.

   (b)   Each provider shall use its best efforts to maintain the PEG channels
so that they are located adjacent to each other on the channel lineup
throughout the term of their respective franchise agreement or competitive
video service agreement, unless otherwise agreed to by the city.
   (c)   Each provider shall provide 90 days’ advance written notice to the
City Council regarding any proposed change to the PEG channel lineup.
   (d)   The public access channel may be shared at each provider’s discretion
with programming from other communities, a provider’s local origination

shall each, with the exception of the city’s current provider, grant the city a
one-time payment of $16,000 or equipment of equivalent or greater value, or an
amount equal to 0.5% of gross revenues as defined in §
808.02(o), at the discretion of the city. The nature of the grant shall be set

agreement.

or any other federal or state regulatory commission or agency having

regulatory agencies to a provider shall likewise be made available to the city
within 15 days of receipt of the response.

other relevant facts as may be required by the city.
   (c)   No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the

additional sums payable under the provisions of this section.
   (d)   The city shall have the right to audit and recompute any amounts
determined to be payable in satisfaction of the fees set forth in this section.

of the audit report. The provider shall pay the cost of the audit if the city
determines that the annual payment to the city for the preceding year is
thereby increased by more than 5%.

amount due shall accrue from such date at the lesser of:
      (1)   The annual rate of 12%; or

support, resources or other activities to be provided by a provider, are within
the exclusions from the term “franchise fee” as set forth in § 622(g)(2) of the
Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 542(g)(2)).
   (i)   The fees and interest payments provided for by this section are not
deemed to be in the nature of a tax, and are in addition to any and all taxes
of general applicability or other fees or charges which a provider shall be
required to pay to the city or any state or federal agency or authority.
   (j)   A provider shall not apply the compensation or other payments to be
made to the city pursuant to this section as a deduction from, or a credit
against, any city taxes of general applicability (other than income taxes) or
other city fees or charges, each of which shall be deemed to be separate and
distinct obligations of the provider.
   (k)   A provider shall not apply any federal, state, local or any other form
of taxes, governmental fees or charges as a deduction from, or credit against,
any fees or interest required pursuant to this section, each of which shall be

§ 869.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to minimize and control the negative secondary effects of sexually
oriented businesses within the city in order to promote the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of the city. The provisions of this chapter have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials or communication, including sexually
oriented entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose or effect of this
chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented entertainment
protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution, or to deny access by
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Furthermore, it is not the intent or effect of this chapter to
condone or legitimize the distribution of or exhibition of entertainment that
is obscene.
   (b)   Based on evidence submitted to City Council and the Planning
Commission concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses including: the findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton
v. Playtime Theaters, Inc. 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theaters,
427 U.S. 50 (1976) and Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991) and
including the studies conducted by other cities including, but not limited to,
those conducted by New York City, New York; Kansas City, Missouri; Denver,
Colorado; Newport News, Virginia and Phoenix, Arizona, this City Council finds
the following.
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary and
unlawful and unhealthy activities.
      (2)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-
private booths or rooms for viewing films, videos or live sexually oriented
entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases
such as syphilis, gonorrhea and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      (3)   Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that
encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions.
      (4)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate
those activities and maintain their facilities.
      (5)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented
films.
      (6)   The findings noted in divisions (b)(1) through (b)(5) hereof raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (7)   Sexually oriented business have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (8)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of
sexually oriented businesses. Further, such licensing procedure will place a
heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented
businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare
of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business, and fully in possession and control
of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (9)   The regulation of nudity in sexually oriented businesses will
further the substantial government interests in preventing prostitution and
other sex-related crimes, including illegal sex acts, and protecting the public
health, safety and welfare.
      (10)   Removal of doors on viewing booths in sexually oriented business
and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths will advance
the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary
sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters and will facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in
protecting the public health, safety and welfare.
      (11)   Requiring sufficient lighting in all sexually oriented businesses
will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal sexual
activity on the premises of sexually oriented businesses, and will facilitate
the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in
protecting the public health, safety and welfare.
      (12)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented
businesses, and by the employees of such businesses, will facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, and will thereby further the substantial government interest in
protecting the public health, safety and welfare.
      (13)   A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related
crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually
oriented business or adult motel and barring such individuals from the
management of and employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of
years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission of sexually related
criminal acts, including conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases.

employee leaving the service of an employer shall be allocable only to the

case the individual shall be considered an occasional entrant for purposes of
the city income tax. A day is a full day or any fractional part of a day;

section to the municipality, if any, in which the employer’s principal place of
business is located, and no portion of that tax is refunded to the individual;

an occasional entrant to the city performs services within the city, the
employer of said individual shall begin withholding the city income tax from
remuneration paid by the employer to the individual, and shall remit the
withheld income tax to the city in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter. Since the individual can no longer be considered to have been an
occasional entrant, the employer is further required to remit taxes on income
earned in the city by the individual for the first 12 days.

income paid to an S corporation shareholder shall be taxable in the following
manner:

or apportioned to the state, the distributive share is taxable only to the
extent that it represents wages or net earnings from self-employment; and

allocated or apportioned to the state, the full amount of the distributive
share is taxable.

(Ord. 2007-217, passed 10-15-2007; Ord. 2012-202, passed 8-20-2012)
§ 890.04 EFFECTIVE PERIOD.
   (a)   The tax shall be levied, collected and paid with respect to the
income, salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation and with respect to

(Ord. 2007-217, passed 10-15-2007)
§ 890.05 DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX.
   (a)   Method of determination. Net profits from a business or profession
conducted both within and without the boundaries of the city shall be
considered as having a taxable situs for purposes of the tax in the same
proportion as the average ratio of:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
city during the taxable period to the average original cost of all the real and
tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated. Real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the city to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed. Wages, salaries and other compensation shall be
included to the extent that they represent qualifying wages; and
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the city to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
   (b)   Basis. In the event that the foregoing allocation formula in division
(a) above does not produce an equitable result, another basis may, under
uniform regulations, be substituted so as to produce such result. A basis using
the “books and records” method, or another method, may be substituted at the
discretion of the Administrator.
   (c)   Sales made in the City of Solon. As used in division (a)(3) hereof,
SALES MADE IN THE CITY OF SOLON means:
      (1)   All sales of taxable personal property which is delivered within
the City of Solon regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from
a stock of goods within the City of Solon;
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the City of Solon regardless of where title passes even though transported from
a point outside the City of Solon if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through
its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City of
Solon and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion; and
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the City of Solon to purchasers outside of the City of Solon
regardless of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own
employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place where delivery is made.
   (d)   Total allocation. The percentages determined in accordance with
divisions (c)(1), (c)(2) and (c)(3) hereof, or such of the aforesaid
percentages as are applicable to the particular taxpayer, shall be added
together and the total so obtained shall be divided by the number of
percentages used in deriving said total in order to obtain the business
allocation percentage referred to in division (a) hereof. A factor is
applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or outside the city.
   (e)   Rentals. Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities under divisions (c) through
(g) of §
890.03 only if and to the extent that the rental, ownership, management or
operations of the real estate from which such rentals are derived (whether so
rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through agents or
other representatives) constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole
or in part. The net profits will be allocated in accordance with the three-
factor formula, unless approval is given by the Administrator to use a
substitute method (see division (b) above). Net profits not constituting a
business activity remain taxable, and shall be taxed using the books and
records method.
      (1)   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties,
regardless of number and value, aggregates in excess of $125 per month, it
shall be prima facie evidence that the rental, ownership, management or
operation of such properties is a business activity of such taxpayer, and the
net income of such rental property shall be subject to tax.
      (2)   In the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or
fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds $125 per month.
      (3)   In the case of farm property, the owner shall be considered engaged
in a business activity when he or she shares in crops or when the rental is
based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from the farm,
whether or not the gross income exceeds said $125 per month. Any person who
operates a licensed rooming house shall be considered in business whether or
not the gross income exceeds $125 per month.
   (f)   Operating loss-carry forward.
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to October 1, 1967, allocable to the city may be applied against the
portion of the profit of succeeding tax years allocable to the city until
exhausted, but in no event for more than five taxable years immediately
following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating
loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
      (2)   The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the city in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to
the city.
      (3)   The Administrator shall provide by Rules and Regulations the manner
in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.

§ 890.06 RETURNS AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   When a return is required to be made and filed. Each taxpayer, except
as herein provided, shall, whether or not a tax is due thereon, make and file a
return on or before April 15 of the year following the effective date of this
chapter and on or before April 15 of each year thereafter. When the return is
made for a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the
return shall be filed on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month from
the end of such fiscal year or period.
   (b)   Form and content of return. The return shall be filed with the
Administrator on a form or forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from
such Administrator, or on an acceptable generic form as defined in this
chapter, setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned and/or received, and gross income from a business,
profession or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the
acquisition of such gross income earned during the preceding year and subject
to said tax;
      (2)   The amount of tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other
information as the Administrator may require, including but not limited to
copies of all W-2 Forms, 1099 Miscellaneous Income Forms, page one of Form
1040, pages one through four of Form 1120, 1120S (including (K-1), 2106, 1065
(including K-1s), Schedule C (including cost of goods manufactured and/or
sold), Schedule E, Schedule F and any other federal schedules, if applicable.
   (c)   Taxpayer; return. The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of
the filing thereof, pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due
thereon; provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have
been deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of §
890.07, or where any portion of said tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to the provisions of §
890.08 or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit for
the amount so paid in accordance with §
890.17, shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing said return.
   (d)   Taxpayer; overpayment. A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax
to which the city is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have
such overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his
or her election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof)
shall be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than $1
shall be collected or refunded.
   (e)   Extension of time for filing returns. The Administrator may extend the
time for filing of the annual return upon the request of the taxpayer provided
that a copy of the federal extension is filed with the Administrator on or
before the original due date of the city tax return.
      (1)   For taxable years 2004 and later, the extended due date for
individuals shall be the last day of the month following the month to which
federal income tax due date has been extended. For businesses, if the extension
is filed through the Ohio Business Gateway the extended due date shall be the
last day of the month to which the due date of the federal income tax return
has been extended. If not filed through the Ohio Business Gateway the extended
due date shall be the last day of the month following the month to which the
due date of the federal income tax return has been extended. The Administrator
may deny the extension if the taxpayer fails to file the request timely, fails
to file a copy of the federal extension request, or if the taxpayer’s income
tax account with the city is delinquent in any way.
      (2)   The Administrator may require a tentative return, accompanied by
payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon by the date the return is
normally due.
      (3)   No penalty or interest shall be assessed in those cases in which
the return is filed and the final tax paid within the period as extended.
   (f)   Consolidated returns.
      (1)   Any affiliated group which files a consolidated return for federal
income tax purposes pursuant to IRC § 1501 may file a consolidated return with
the city.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the city
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Administrator shall
require such additional information as he or she may deem necessary to
ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the city. If the
Administrator finds that net profits are not properly allocated to the city by
reason of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by
stock ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity, or by some other method, he or
she shall make such allocations as he or she deems appropriate to produce a
fair and proper allocation of net profits to the city.
   (g)   Amended returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements, limitations, or both, contained in §§
890.16 and
890.17. Such amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting (i.e., cash
or accrual) or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the
original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer’s city tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended city return showing income subject to the city tax based
upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (h)   Business losses. Each taxpayer may offset business losses against
business net profits from any business conducted in the city or in any other
municipality that does not levy an income tax on net profits therefrom.
However, a loss from the operation of a business may not be used to offset the
income on a taxpayer’s W-2 Form.
   (i)   Reporting a net loss; filing requirements. Any business, profession,
association or corporation reporting a net loss is subject to the filing
requirements of this chapter.
   (j)   Liability. The officer or employee of such employer having control or
supervision or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making
the payment shall be personally liable for failure to file the return or pay
the tax, penalties or interest due as required herein. The dissolution,
bankruptcy or reorganization of any such employer does not discharge an
officer’s or employee’s liability for a prior failure of such business to file
the return or pay taxes, penalties or interest due.
   (k)   Failure to receive or procure. The failure of any employer, taxpayer
or person to receive or procure a return, declaration or other required form
shall not excuse him or her from filing any information return, tax return,
declaration or other required form, or from paying the tax.
(Ord. 2007-217, passed 10-15-2007)
§ 890.07 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within or doing business within the city shall deduct,
at the time of payment of an employee’s income, salary, wage, commission or
other compensation, the tax of 2% per annum on and after July 1, 1995, of the
gross income, salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation due by said
employer to said employee and shall make a return and pay to the Administrator
the amount of taxes so deducted. Said returns shall be on a form or forms
prescribed by or acceptable to the Administrator and shall be subject to the
rules and regulations prescribed therefore by the Administrator.
      (1)   If the taxes withheld by an employer for the city during the
previous tax year averaged $250 per month or more, the employer shall remit
payment of the withheld taxes to the city on or before the twentieth day of the
month following the month for which the taxes were withheld.
      (2)   If the taxes withheld by an employer for the city during the
previous tax year averaged less than $250 per month, payments may be remitted
quarterly on or before the last day of the month following the end of the
quarter for which the taxes were withheld, subject to the approval of the
Administrator, and in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by
the Administrator.
      (3)   Such employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required
to be deducted and withheld whether or not such taxes have in fact been
withheld.
   (b)   Such employer in collecting said tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to the city, as a trustee for the
benefit of the city and any such tax collected by such employer from his or her
employees shall, until the same is paid to the city, be deemed a trust fund in
the hands of such employer.
   (c)   Said payments shall be on a form or forms furnished by or obtainable
upon request from the Administrator, setting forth the amount of tax deducted
for the month. A receipted copy of such form shall be returned to the employer
to be attached to and filed with the employer’s quarterly return of income tax
withheld
   (d)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed by him or her exclusively in or
about such person’s residence, even though such residence is in the city, but
such employee shall be subject to all of the requirements of this chapter.
   (e)   The officer or employee having control or supervision, or charged with
the responsibility of withholding the tax, filing the return and making the
payment, shall be personally liable for the failure to file the return or pay
the tax due as required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy or reorganization
of any such employer does not discharge an officer’s or employee’s liability
for a prior failure of such business to file a return or pay taxes due.
   (f)   On or before February 28 following any calendar year, such employer
shall file with the Administrator an annual reconciliation return along with an
information return (W-2 Form) for each employee from whom Solon income tax has
been or should have been withheld, showing the name, address and Social
Security number of the employee, the total amount of compensation paid during
the year and the amount of municipal income tax withheld from the employee with
the municipality for which said tax was withheld identified. The information
return shall also include all of the information required to be reported by the
employer to IRS on a W-2 form. At the time of filing the annual reconciliation
return the employer shall pay over any amounts deducted or which should have
been deducted during the preceding year but which were not remitted. The annual
reconciliation form shall be obtained from the Administrator.
   (g)   On or before February 28 of each year all individuals, businesses,
employers, brokers or other who engage persons, either on a fee or commission
basis or as independent contractors and not employees (those who are not
subject to withholding) must provide the city with copies of all 1099
Miscellaneous Income Forms and/or a list of names, addresses, Social Security
numbers or federal identification numbers and a total amount of earnings,
payments, bonuses, commissions and/or fees paid to each person.
   (h)   All employers that provide any contractual service within the city,
and who employ subcontractors in conjunction with that service, shall provide
the city the names and addresses of the subcontractors. The subcontractors
shall be responsible for all income tax employer requirements under this
chapter.
(Ord. 2007-217, passed 10-15-2007)
§ 890.08 DECLARATIONS AND ESTIMATED PAYMENTS.
   (a)   Declaration of income not collected at source. Every person who
anticipates any taxable income which is not subject to §
890.07 and/or from which tax will not be fully withheld, or who engages in any
business, profession, enterprise or activity subject to the tax imposed by §
890.03, shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the
estimated profit or loss from such business activity together with the
estimated tax due thereon, if any; provided, however, that if a person’s income
is wholly from wages from which the tax will be withheld and remitted to the
city in accordance with §
890.07, such person need not file a declaration.
      (1)   The declaration shall be filed on or before April 15 of each year
during the effective period set forth in §
890.04 or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the date the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (2)   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (3)   The declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by, or
obtainable from, the Administrator, or on an acceptable generic form as defined
in this chapter. Credit shall be taken for city tax to be withheld from any
portion of such income. In accordance with the provisions of §
890.17, credit may be taken for tax to be paid or to be withheld and remitted
to another taxing municipality.
      (4)   The original declaration (or any subsequent amendment thereof) may
be increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date as
provided for herein.
   (b)   Payment to accompany declaration. Such declaration of estimated tax to
be paid to the city shall be accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of
the estimated tax due.
      (1)   If the taxpayer is an individual, at least a similar amount shall
be paid on or before the last day of the seventh, tenth and thirteenth months
after the beginning of the taxpayer’s taxable year, provided that in case an
amended declaration has been filed, or the taxpayer is taxable for a portion of
the year only, the unpaid balance shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (2)   If the taxpayer is a corporation or association, at least a similar
amount shall be paid on or before the fifteenth day of the sixth, ninth and
twelfth months of the taxable year; provided, however, that in case an amended
declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon shall be paid
in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
   (c)   Penalties or interest. No penalties or interest shall be assessed, for
not filing a declaration, on any resident taxpayer who was not domiciled in the
city on the first day of January in the year in which they became subject to
estimated payments, nor shall penalties or interest be assessed on estimated
payments if the taxpayer has remitted an amount equal to 100% of the previous
year’s tax liability, provided that the previous year reflected a 12-month
period and the taxpayer filed a return for that year, nor shall penalties or
interest be assessed on estimated payments if the taxpayer has remitted an
amount equal to 90% of the final tax liability for the tax year due on or
before April 15 of the current year.

   A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax assessment made by the
Administrator when a return has been filed in good faith and the tax paid
thereon within the time prescribed by the Administrator. Further, in the
absence of fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any
additional tax assessment resulting from a federal audit, provided that an
amended return is filed and the additional tax is paid within three months
after a final determination of the federal tax liability.
(Ord. 2007-217, passed 10-15-2007)
§ 890.12 ABATEMENT OF INTEREST AND PENALTY.

      (2)   Make any incomplete, false or fraudulent return;
      (3)   Fail, neglect or refuse to pay the tax, penalties and/or interest
imposed by this chapter;
      (4)   Fail, neglect or refuse to withhold the tax from his or her

      (6)   Fail to appear before the Administrator and to produce his or her

Administrator;
      (7)   Refuse to disclose to the Administrator any information with
respect to the income or net profits of a taxpayer;
      (8)   Fail to comply with the provisions of this chapter or any order or

      (9)   Give to an employer false information as to his or her true name,
correct Social Security number and residence address, or fail to promptly
notify an employer of any change in residence address and the date thereof;
      (10)   Fail to use ordinary diligence in maintaining proper records of
employees’ residence addresses, total wages paid and city tax withheld, or

or any part of the tax, penalties or interest imposed by this chapter.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under this chapter shall
be commenced within three years after the commission of the offense; provided
that in the case of fraud, failure to file a return, or the omission of 25% or

commenced within six years after the commission of the offense in accordance
with R.C. § 718.12(B).
   (c)   Any person who violates any of the provisions of division (a) above
shall be subject to the penalties in §
890.99.
(Ord. 2007-217, passed 10-15-2007)
§ 890.14 RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE.
§ 890.15 FAILURE TO PROCURE FORMS NOT EXCUSE.
   The failure of any employer or person to receive or procure a return,
declaration or other required form shall not excuse him or her from making any
information return, return or declaration, from filing such form or from paying
the tax.
(Ord. 2007-217, passed 10-15-2007)
§ 890.16 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   Unpaid taxes recoverable as other debts.
      (1)   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together
with any interest and penalties thereon, by suit, as other debts of like amount
are recoverable. Such suit shall not be made after three years from the time
the return was due or filed, whichever is later. However, in the case of fraud,
omission of 25% or more of income subject to this tax, or failure to file a
return, all additional assessments shall be made and all prosecutions to
recover municipal income taxes and penalties and interest thereon shall be
brought within six years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later. In those cases in which a Commissioner of Internal Revenue
and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the federal statute of limitations,
the period within which an additional assessment may be made by the
Administrator shall be one year from the time of the final determination of the
federal tax liability.
      (2)   When deemed necessary, the Administrator may outsource the
collection of delinquent accounts to a law firm or collection agency. The fees
charged for outsourcing, including related court costs, shall be assessed and
added to the delinquent taxpayers’ liability.
   (b)   Refunds of taxes erroneously paid. Taxes erroneously paid shall not be
refunded unless a claim for refund is made within three years from the date on
which such payment was made or the return was due, or within three months after
the final determination of the federal tax liability, whichever is later. In
addition, the following shall apply regarding refunds of tax withheld from non-
qualified deferred compensation plans (NDCP):
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from an NDCP. The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP;
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from an
NDCP, and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP
and upon which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the
amount representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed
and the income received from the NDCP. If different tax rates applied to the
tax years in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates
will be used to compute the refund amount; and
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee’s
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer’s terms and conditions
necessary to receive the non-qualified compensation.
   (c)   Refunds; recovery. Income tax that has been deposited with the city,
but should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the
city as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds. Income
tax that should have been deposited with the city, but was deposited with
another municipality, shall be subject to recovery by the city. The city will
allow a non-refundable credit for any amount owed the city that is in excess of
the amount to be refunded by the other municipality, as long as the tax rate of
the other municipality is the same or higher than the city’s tax rate. If the
city’s tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the rates
is also subject to collection by the city.
   (d)   Overpayments of withheld tax. Overpayments of withheld tax that have
resulted due to incorrect withholding of an employee by an employer, and are
not due as a result of excess withholding requested by the employee, shall be
refunded to the employer. It shall be the responsibility of the employer, and
not the city, to refund such overpayment to the employee. However, nothing in
this division (d) shall affect the right of a nonresident employee to apply
directly to the city for refund of income tax withheld for days worked out of
Solon.
   (e)   Payments on delinquent amounts. Payments on delinquent amounts shall
be applied in the following order:
      (1)   To the taxes owed for any previous year in the order in which such
taxes became due;
      (2)   To unpaid penalty and interest assessments in the order in which
such assessments became due; and
      (3)   To the taxpayer’s current estimated tax liability.
   (f)   Amounts of less than $1. Amounts of less than $1 shall not be
collected or refunded.
(Ord. 2007-217, passed 10-15-2007)
§ 890.17 SOLON RESIDENT SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN OTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (a)   Claim for credit. If it is made to appear that a Solon resident has
paid a municipal income tax on the same income to another municipality, such
Solon resident may claim a credit of the amount of income tax paid to such
other municipality, but not in excess of the tax rate assessed by this chapter.
   (b)   Filing of return or form required. In the event a Solon resident is
entitled to credit for taxes paid another municipality, such Solon resident is
required to file a return or form in such manner as the Administrator
designated by the city may prescribe.
   (c)   Assignment of claim. Assignment of any claim for refund to which a
Solon resident may be entitled from another municipality shall be tentatively
accepted as payment of that portion of Solon income tax represented by such
assignment, provided, however, that if satisfactory evidence is offered that
the taxpayer is entitled to the claim covered by the assignment, such taxpayer
shall not be deprived of credit therefor because of fault or neglect on the
part of either municipality.
   (d)   Failure to file return or form. In the event that such Solon resident
fails, neglects or refuses to file such return or form as is prescribed by the
Administrator, he or she shall not be entitled to such credit and shall be
considered in violation of this chapter for failure to file a return and make
payment of taxes due hereunder.
   (e)   Time for filing claims. Any claim for credit for income taxes paid
another municipality on the same income taxable hereunder, or claim for or
assignment of any refund due to the credit provided for herein, must be filed
with the Administrator on or before December 31 of the year following that for
which such credit is claimed, provided that where such claim for reciprocity
refund has been assigned to the municipality of residence, such municipality of
residence shall file a claim for refund with the Administrator of the city on
or before January 31 following. Failure to file such claim for reciprocity
credit or refund, or assignment thereof, within the time prescribed herein
shall render such credit, claim for refund or assignment null and void.
   (f)   Credit. No credit will be given to taxpayers for school district
income taxes.

shall be distributed to other municipal funds in accordance with the voter
approved levies and City Council legislation.

§ 890.19 DUTIES AND AUTHORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   Duty to receive tax imposed. It shall be the duty of the Administrator
to receive the tax imposed by this chapter in the manner prescribed herein from
the taxpayers, to keep an accurate record thereof and to report all monies so
received.
   (b)   Duty to enforce collection. It shall be the duty of the Administrator
to enforce payment of all taxes owing to the city, to keep accurate records for
a minimum of six years showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to
file a declaration and make any return, or both, including taxes withheld, and
to show the dates and amounts of payments thereof.
   (c)   Authority to make and enforce regulations. The Administrator is hereby
charged with the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and is hereby
empowered, subject to the approval of the Board of Review, to adopt and
promulgate and to enforce rules and regulations pertaining to the collection of
taxes and the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter,
including provisions for the re-examination and correction of returns.
Taxpayers are hereby required to comply with the requirements of this chapter
and the rules and regulations.
   (d)   Authority to arrange installment payments. The Administrator is
authorized to arrange for the payment of unpaid taxes, interest and penalties
on a schedule of installment payments, when the taxpayer has proved to the
Administrator that, due to certain hardship conditions, he or she is unable to
pay the full amount of the tax due. Such authorization shall not be granted
until proper returns are filed by the taxpayer for all amounts owed by him or
her under this chapter. Failure to make any deferred payment when due shall

            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the city to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under §
891.04(c);
         C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the city to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   A.   If the apportionment factors described in division (f)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the city, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
city may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of
the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one
or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
891.12(a).
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (f)(2)A. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by §
891.12(a).
         D.   Nothing in division (f)(2) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (f)(1)B. of this section, wages, salaries, and

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            3.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described

customer, client, or patient.
         B.   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (f)(3)A. or B. of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (f)(1)C. of this section, and except
as provided in division (g) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:
         A.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in the city if,
regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the following
criteria:
            1.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the city from a
stock of goods located within the city.
            2.   The property is delivered within the city from a location

employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the city and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            3.   The property is shipped from a place within the city to
purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the taxpayer is
not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or
promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
         B.   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
city to the extent that such services are performed in the city.
         C.   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the city shall be sitused to the city.
         D.   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the city shall be sitused to the city.
         E.   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the city based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the city.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the city’s tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the city or if the individual
taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the city. The city shall
allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the purpose of
calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation
in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported

received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the city
to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of the city shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the city. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under the city's income tax ordinance.
      (7)   When calculating the ratios described in division (f)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (f)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (g)   (1)   As used in this division:
         A.   QUALIFYING REMOTE EMPLOYEE OR OWNER means an individual who is an
employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            1.   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            2.   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         B.   QUALIFYING REMOTE WORK LOCATION means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
QUALIFYING REMOTE WORK LOCATION may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         C.   QUALIFYING REPORTING LOCATION means one of the following:
            1.    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            2.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (g)(1)C.1. of this section, the reporting location in
this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or
periodically reports during the taxable year;
            3.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (g)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section, the location that the
taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying reporting
location, provided the assignment is made in good faith and is recorded and
maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may change the
QUALIFYING REPORTING LOCATION designated for an employee or owner under this
division at any time.
         D.   REPORTING LOCATION means either of the following:
            1.   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            2.   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under §
891.04 of this chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (f) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A.   A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         B.   The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         C.   After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election
applies to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business.
The taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         D.   Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (f)
(l) of this section all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (g)(2):
         A.   For the purpose of division (f)(1)A. of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal properly used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         B.   For the purpose of division (f)(1)B. of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         C.   For the purpose of division (f)(1)C. of this section, and
notwithstanding division (f)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (f)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to §
891.04 of this chapter.

§ 891.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
Withholding Provisions
   (a)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the city shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the city. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under §
891.03 or division (b)(4) or (b)(6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld
at the rate, specified in division (b)(1) of this section, of 2%. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the city the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld
or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         A.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the city in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the city in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200.
            Payment under division (b)(1)A. of this section shall be made to
the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month
for which the tax was withheld.
         B.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)A. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the city. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agents, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the city as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold city income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the city the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for
that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
city's income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the city until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         A.   The names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the city during the preceding calendar year;
         B.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         C.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         D.   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         E.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the city's income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (c)(2)A.1. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's principal place of work with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with

in the city if the employee performed such services in the city on 20 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the city.
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed

WORKSITE LOCATION means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
city at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can reasonably be expected by the employer to last more

of the employer in the city than in any other municipal corporation on that
day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to

      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (c)(2)A. of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)B. of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the city exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to the city for any subsequent days in that calendar
year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal
services performed in the city.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the city under
division (c)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax for the city for
the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the employee
for personal services performed in the city.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the city and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in §
891.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
city, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the city.
         To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator
with the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (c)(2)A. and (c)(4) of this section shall not apply to

whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under §

other payer, and no additional tax is due to the city.
      (2)   Retirees having no municipal taxable income for city income tax
purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written

retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.

W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in the case
of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio form
IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation
necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
         A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the city to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of this
section applies regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or
on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (g)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each return
required to be filed under this section shall be completed and filed as
required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed for the
filing of state individual income tax returns under division (G) of R.C. §
5747.08. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms
prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the city. No remittance is required if the net
amount due is $10 or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the city’s income tax
return. The extended due date of city's income tax return shall be the 15th day
of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return
relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due
date of the city's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual
shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable
year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file under this
division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax
Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         A.   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the city’s income tax return.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer’s city income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the city income tax return is due, the
Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of city's
income tax return. The extended due date of city's income tax return shall be
the same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the city, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (5)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (3), or (4) of this section, the Tax
Administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return whichever occurs
first.
         A.   If a Tax Administrator violates division (g)(5) of this section,
the municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         B.   Division (g)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (g)(2) of this section if the Tax Administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (g)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (g)(2)B. of this section.
      (6)   To the extent that any provision in this division (g) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) prevail.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the city shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is $10 or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the city for a taxable
year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the city an
annual net profit return under division (f)(3) of this section unless the
provisions of division (h)(3) apply.
      (3)   A.   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person does
not expect to be a taxpayer subject to city income tax ordinance for a taxable
year if both the following apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the city for
the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed services at
a worksite location (as defined in § 891.04(c)(1)G. within the city.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the city and does
not expect to be subject to city income tax for the taxable year.
         B.   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the city. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within City of Solon, make anv sales in City of Solon or otherwise become
subject to the tax levied by City of Solon during the taxable year. If the
affiant does become subject to the tax levied by City of Solon for the taxable
year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as
a taxpayer with City of Solon income tax ordinance and rules and regulations.”
The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (h)(3)B.
above the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         D.   Nothing in division (h)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (i)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (j)   Taxes withheld for the city by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in §
891.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the city, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the city and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the city to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the city, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the city
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter
and of the city's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway
   (m)   (l)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the city's
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.

withholding tax returns.
Extension for Service in or for the Armed Forces
   (n)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the city for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by the city during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (o)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
         However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division
are not delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (o)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (p)   (l)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (n) and (o) of this section.
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (p)(2)A. of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, QUALIFYING TAXPAYER means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the Armed Forces.
         B.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (p)
(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (q)   For each taxable year to which division (n), (o), or (p) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (o)(2) and (o)(3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.

section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a group

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. A consolidated return filed

taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the city's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (s)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (s)(l) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (s)(l) or (s)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (t)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated city income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the city. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated city
income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated city income tax
return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate
return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (u)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated city income tax return in the
same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury

federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (v)   (l)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (v)(2), (v)(3), and
(v)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income

taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and

wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated city income tax return shall
make any adjustment otherwise required under §
891.02(c)(2)C.1. to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated city income tax return shall do one of the
following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
891.05(r) through (y), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
891.05(r) through (y), include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in §
891.05(r) through (y), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the city;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the city's income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)   Corporations filing a consolidated city income tax return shall make
the computations required under §
891.05(r) through (y) by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (x)   Each corporation filing a consolidated city income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the city in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the city before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with the city may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   (a)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the city who is required to and
does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (c) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due to the city under this chapter.
   (b)   The city shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the city who works in a joint economic development zone created under R.C. §
715.691 or a joint economic development district created under R.C. § 715.70,
715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit against its tax on
income to its residents who are employed in another municipal corporation.
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax
in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by dividing
the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for that
municipality.

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld for the city from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the city in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, DATE OF
THE POSTMARK means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by

the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the 15th day of the sixth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;

   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to §
891.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the city under §
891.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the city but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes

accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than $10 or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds $10 or
more.
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (c)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
891.21.
   (d)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (e)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
891.18(a)(4).
(Ord. 2015-212, passed 11-2-2015)
§ 891.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited with the city, but should have been
deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the city as a refund but
is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (b)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the city is subject to recovery by the city. If the
city's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund
of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the city shall allow
a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the city claims is due
with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to
the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (c)   If the city's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
city's tax rate. However, if the city's tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to the city, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-212, passed 11-2-2015)
§ 891.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the city changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
city. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax dues together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under §
891.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by §
891.12(e) for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than $10, no refund need be
paid by the city. A request filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in §
891.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's city's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended city return showing income subject to the city's
income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional city income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than $10.
(Ord. 2015-212, passed 11-2-2015)
§ 891.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, QUALIFYING DEFERRAL PERIOD means a period
of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in §
891.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth day
after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is
either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in §
891.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the city does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by §
891.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division §
891.09(e).
   (e)   No civil action to recover city income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 2015-212, passed 11-2-2015)
§ 891.13 AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
      A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer's attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
      This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is
not an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2015-212, passed 11-2-2015)
§ 891.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   LAST KNOWN ADDRESS. The address the Tax Administrator has at the
time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the Tax
Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a change
of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery
service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   UNDELIVERABLE ADDRESS. An address to which the postal service or an
authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to deliver an
assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-delivery is
because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056. If
the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment's postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other city official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
         Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
         If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)
(1)A. of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other city official,
or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division prevents
the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with
the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the Local
Board of Tax Review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-212, passed 11-2-2015)
§ 891.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, CLAIM means a claim for an amount payable to
the city that arises pursuant to the city's income tax imposed in accordance
with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-212, passed 11-2-2015)
§ 891.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the city as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the city from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-212, passed 11-2-2015)
§ 891.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the city ordinance or state law to
be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud the city or the Tax Administrator.

      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to

the city to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.

the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the city or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
Identification Information
   (c)   (1)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's Social Security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to §
891.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in §
891.99.
         B.   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under §
891.19(c) within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to §
891.18.
         C.   The penalties provided for under divisions (c)(2)A. and B. of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in §
891.99 for a violation of §
891.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (d)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.
   (e)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (f)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.

official.
      (3)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for

The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not

meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.

as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the

remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.

Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the

Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.

Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the

appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax Review.
The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the
assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60
days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60

section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax

provided in R.C. § 5717.011.
   (f)   The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under R.C. §

pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body subject to R.C. §
121.22.

herein levied shall, as to lodging and tax collections, be at all reasonable

corporation under the control of a recreation commission or legislative body.
   (b)   The exemption from tax provided by this section shall, however, not be
allowed in case of admissions to wrestling matches, prize fights or boxing,

§ 894.04 COLLECTION OF TAX.
   (a)   Every person receiving any payment on which a tax is levied under this
chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making the
admission payment. The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall be
deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the same until
paid to the Director as herein provided.
   (b)   Any person required to collect the tax imposed under this chapter who
fails to collect the same or, having collected the same, fails to remit the
same to the Director in the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such
failure be the result of his or her own act or the result of acts or conditions
beyond his or her control, shall nevertheless be personally liable to the city
for the amount of such tax, and shall, unless the remittance be made as herein
required, be guilty of a violation of this chapter.
   (c)   The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the time the admission
charge is paid by the person seeking admission to any place and shall be
reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the Director in
monthly installments and remittances therefor on or before the thirtieth day of
the month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in which the tax is
collected or received. The first return and remittance under this chapter shall
be made on or before November 30, 1947, and shall cover the period from and
including October 1 to and including October 31 or a four or five-week policy
month period as the case may be.
   (d)   Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made by check,
unless payment or remittance is otherwise required by the Director, but payment
by check shall not relieve the person collecting the tax from liability for
payment and remittance of the tax to the Director unless the check is honored
and is in the full and correct amount.
   (e)   The person receiving any payment for admissions shall make out a
return upon such forms setting forth such information as the Director may
require, showing the amount of the tax upon admissions for which he or she is
liable for the preceding monthly period, and shall sign and transmit the same
to the Director with a remittance for such amount. The Director may, in his or
her discretion, require verified annual returns from any person receiving
admission payments setting forth such additional information as he or she may
deem necessary to determine correctly the amount of tax collected and payable.
   (f)   Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition, entertainment or
amusement makes an admission charge which is subject to the tax herein levied,
and the same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Director
shall be the judge, the Director may require the report and remittance of the
admission tax immediately upon the collection of the same, at the conclusion of
the performance or exhibition, or at the conclusion of the series of
performances or exhibitions, or at such other times as the Director shall
determine. Failure to comply with any requirement of the Director as to report
and remittance of the tax as required shall be a violation of this chapter.
   (g)   The books, records and accounts of any person collecting a tax herein
levied shall, as to admission charges and tax collections, be at all reasonable
times subject to examination and audit by the Director. If the tax imposed by
this chapter is not paid when due there shall be added, as part of the tax,
interest at the rate of 1% per month from the time when the tax became due
until paid.

fee for which shall be $1, which certificate shall continue valid until
December 31 of the year in which it is issued. Such certificate of
registration, or duplicate original copies thereof to be issued by the Director
without additional charge, shall be posted in a conspicuous place in each
ticket or box office where tickets of admission are sold.
(Ord. 1947-54, passed 11-6-1947)
§ 894.06 CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION FOR TEMPORARY OR TRANSITORY AMUSEMENT.
   Whenever a certificate of registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owners, lessees or custodians of the
building, lots or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in §
894.04 by the owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person conducting
the place. The applicant for a certificate of registration for such purpose
shall furnish with the application therefor the name and address of the owner,
lessee or custodian of the premises upon which the amusement is to be
conducted, and such owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified by the
Director of the issuance of such certificate and the joint liability for
collection and remittance of such tax.
(Ord. 1947-54, passed 11-6-1947)
§ 894.07 RULES AND REGULATIONS.

inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out and enforcing the
payment, collection and remittance of the tax herein levied. A copy of such
rules and regulations shall be published in a newspaper having general
circulation in the city at least once before they shall become effective, and

§ 1044.01 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (a)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for discharges by
industrial users into the city wastewater collection and treatment systems, and
enables the Authority to protect public health in conformity with all
applicable local, state and federal laws relating thereto.
   (b)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the sewage treatment
plant which will interfere with the normal operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting municipal sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the sewage treatment
plant which do not receive adequate treatment, and which will pass through the
system into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be compatible with
the system; and
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the system.
   (c)   This chapter provides for the regulation of discharges into the sewage
disposal works through the enforcement of administrative regulations.

§ 1044.073 CALCULATION OF EQUIVALENT MASS AND CONCENTRATION LIMITS.
   (a)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Authority may
convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed as mass of pollutant
discharged per day of effluent concentration for purposes of calculating
effluent limitations applicable to industrial users pursuant to the procedure
set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 403.6(c).
   (b)   Equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with this section
shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of § 307(d) of the Act
and this chapter. Industrial users will be required to comply with the
equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from
which the equivalent limitations were derived.
(Ord. 1991-239, passed 12-2-1991)
§ 1044.076 NET/GROSS CALCULATION.
   The Authority may elect to adjust categorical pretreatment standards to
reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial user’s intake water
pursuant to the procedure contained in 40 C.F.R. Part 403.15.
(Ord. 1991-239, passed 12-2-1991)
§ 1044.08 STATE REQUIREMENTS.
   State requirements and limitations on discharges to the sewage treatment
plant shall be met by all industrial users which are subject to such standards
in any instance in which they are more stringent than federal requirements and
limitations or those in this or any other applicable ordinance.
(Ord. 1991-239, passed 12-2-1991)
§ 1044.09 RIGHT OF REVISION.
   The Authority reserves the right to amend this chapter to provide for more
stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the sewage treatment

§ 1044.10 DILUTION.
   Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable regulation, no
industrial user shall increase the use of potable or process waste in any way,
mix separate waste streams for the purpose of diluting a discharge or in any
other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the standards set forth in this
chapter. The Authority may impose mass limitations on industrial users which
are suspected of using dilution to meet the pretreatment standards or
requirements of this chapter, or in other cases where the imposition of mass
limitations is deemed appropriate by the Authority.

§ 1044.11 NOTIFICATION OF ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.
   (a)   Industrial users shall immediately notify the treatment plant operator
on duty in responsible charge upon the accidental discharge of wastes in
violation of this chapter to enable countermeasures to be taken to minimize
damage to the wastewater treatment plants, treatment processes and the
receiving waters. The notification shall include location of discharge, date
and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective
actions.
   (b)   This notification shall be followed, within five days of the date of
occurrence, by a detailed written statement describing the causes of the
accidental discharge and the measures being taken to prevent future occurrence.
   (c)   Such notification will not relieve industrial users of liability for
any fines provided for in §
1044.99 of this chapter, or for any expense, loss or damage to the sewer
system, treatment plant or treatment process, or for any fines imposed on the
city on account thereof.

§ 1044.13 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE PREVENTIVE MEASURES.
   Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited or regulated materials or substances established by this chapter.
Any direct or indirect connection or entry point for persistent or deleterious
wastes to the discharger’s plumbing or drainage system shall be eliminated.
Where such action is impractical or unreasonable the industrial user shall
appropriately label such entry points to warn against discharge of such wastes
in violation of this chapter. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental
discharge of prohibited material shall be provided and maintained at the
industrial user’s expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Director for
review and shall be approved by the Director before construction of the
facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not
relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify this facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.

§ 1044.145 BYPASS.
   (a)   An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
an applicable pretreatment standard to be violated, but only if it also is for
essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of division (c) hereof.
   (b)   An industrial user is required to provide notice of bypass as follows.
      (1)   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the Authority at least ten days before the date of
the bypass.
      (2)   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the Authority within
24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A
written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the
industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause, the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue, and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the bypass. The Authority may waive
the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received
within 24 hours.
   (c)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Authority may take enforcement action
against an industrial user for a bypass unless:
      (1)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or
severe property damage;
      (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance
during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if
adequate back-up equipment should have been installed, in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment, to prevent a bypass which occurred during
normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
      (3)   The industrial user submitted notices as required under division
(b) hereof.
   (d)   The Authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the Authority determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in division (c) hereof.

   For grease, oil and inorganic material such as sand, grit and the like,
interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Approving Authority,
they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing
floatable grease in excessive amounts, as specified in §
1044.05 of this chapter, or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful
ingredients, except that such interceptors shall not be required for private
living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and
capacity approved by the Approving Authority, and shall be located as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining
of these interceptors the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal
and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain
records of the dates and means of disposal, which are subject to review by the
Approving Authority. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not
performed by the owner(s)’ personnel must be performed by currently licensed
waste disposal firms.

   (a)   Any categorical industrial user subject to limitations and
prohibitions set forth in this chapter, after the compliance date of such
limitations and prohibitions, or, in the case of a new source, after
commencement of the discharge to the Authority, shall submit to the Authority
during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently by the
Authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or
regulated substances in the effluent. In addition, this report shall include a
record of all measured or estimated average daily flows during the reporting
period. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided,
however, that where cost or feasibility considerations justify it, the
Authority may accept reports of average flows estimated by verifiable
techniques. The Authority, for good cause shown, considering such factors as
local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles or other extenuating
factors, may authorize the submission of said reports in months other than
those specified above.
   (b)   Where the Authority has imposed mass limitations on the industrial
user, as provided for by §
1044.10 of this chapter, the report required by division (a) hereof shall
indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the
discharge of the industrial user.
   (c)   For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established by the Authority in accordance with §
1044.073 of this chapter, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the
industrial user’s long-term production rate. For all other industrial users
subject to pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report
shall include the industrial user’s actual production during the appropriate
sampling period.
   (d)   The report required by this section shall be based upon data obtained
through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered
by the report, which data are representative of conditions occurring during the
reporting period. The Authority shall require a frequency of monitoring
necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment
standards.
   (e)   When determined to be necessary by the Director, user will submit
documentation indicating compliance with applicable BMP(s).
   (f)   The reports required by this section must comply with the signatory
requirements set forth in §

§ 1044.21 HAZARDOUS WASTE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Industrial users who commence discharging after the effective date of
this chapter shall, no later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or
characteristic hazardous waste, notify the Authority, the United States EPA
Regional Waste Management Division Director and the Ohio EPA Division of Solid
and Hazardous Waste Management, in writing, of any discharge to the Authority
of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 C.F.R. Part 261. Any notification under this section need be submitted
only once for each hazardous waste discharged although notification of changed
discharges must be submitted under §
1044.209 of this chapter. This notification requirement does not apply to
pollutants already reported under the self monitoring requirements of §§
1044.18,
1044.203 and
1044.206 of this chapter.
   (b)   The required notification must include:
      (1)   The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261;
      (2)   The EPA hazardous waste number;
      (3)   The type of discharge (continuous, batch or other); and
      (4)   If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such
waste per calendar month to the Authority, the notification shall also include
the following information to the extent it is known and readily available to
the industrial user:
         A.   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes;
         B.   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents
in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month; and
         C.   An estimation of the mass of constituents in the water stream
expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
   (c)   Industrial users are exempt from the requirements of divisions (a) and
(b) hereof during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 C.F.R. Parts 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. Parts 261.30(d) and 261.33
(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the
industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do
not require additional notification.
   (d)   In case of any new regulations under § 3001 of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), identifying additional characteristics of
hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the
industrial user must notify the Authority, United States EPA and Ohio EPA of
the discharge of such substances within 90 days of the effective date of such
regulations.
   (e)   In the case of any notification under this section, the industrial
user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes to the degree it has determined to be economically
practical.
(Ord. 1991-239, passed 12-2-1991)
§ 1044.213 NOTICE OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS, INCLUDING SLUG LOADING.
   All dischargers shall notify the Authority immediately of all discharges
that could cause problems to the Authority, including any slug loadings, as
defined in §
1044.02(rr) of this chapter, by the industrial user.

§ 1044.216 REPORTS OF SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRIAL USERS NOT SUBJECT TO CATEGORICAL
PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   Significant noncategorical industrial users shall submit to the Authority at
least once every six months (on dates specified by the Authority) a description
of the nature, concentration and flow of the pollutants required to be reported
by the Authority. These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis
performed in the period covered by the report and performed in accordance with
the techniques described in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40
C.F.R. Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question or where the Administrator determines that the Part 136
sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated
analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures,
including procedures suggested by the Authority or other persons approved by
the Administrator. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the Authority
in lieu of the significant noncategorical industrial user. Where the Authority
itself collects all the information required for the report, the noncategorical
significant industrial user will not be required to submit the report.
(Ord. 1991-239, passed 12-2-1991)
§ 1044.219 MONITORING AND ANALYSIS.
   Any sampling or analysis done as part of the reports required by §§
1044.18,
1044.203,
1044.206 and
1044.216 of this chapter shall be performed as follows.
   (a)   Grab samples must be used for pH, hexavalent chromium, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organics. For sampling required
in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required by
Section
1044.18,
1044.203 of this chapter, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH,
hexavalent chromium, cyanide, total phenols, oils and grease, sulfide and
volatile organics for facilities for which historical sampling data do not
exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
Authority may authorize a lower minimum. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: for hexavalent chromium, cyanide, total phenols and
sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for
volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. For all other pollutants, 24 hour composite samples must be
obtained through flow proportional composite sample techniques where feasible.
The Authority may waive flow proportional composite sampling for any industrial
user that demonstrates that flow proportional sampling is infeasible. In such
cases, samplings may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling
techniques or through grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will
provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
   (b)   The industrial user shall take a minimum of one representative sample
to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this section.
   (c)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, the industrial user should measure the flows
and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula
of 40 C.F.R. Part 403.6(c) in order to evaluate compliance with pretreatment
standards. Where an alternative concentration or mass limit has been calculated
in accordance with 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c), this adjusted limit along with
supporting data shall be submitted to the Authority.
   (d)   Reports of industrial users shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of this discharge, including the flow, the type of sample, and the
nature and concentration, or production and mass where required or requested by
the Authority, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the
applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring by the
industrial user shall be as prescribed by the Authority. All analysis shall be
performed in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where
40 C.F.R. Part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication Sampling and Analysis
Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants,
April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical
procedures approved by the Authority.
   (e)   If sampling performed by the industrial user indicates a violation,
the user shall notify the Authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Authority within 30 days after
becoming aware of the violation, whether the violation is detected by the
industrial user or Authority personnel, except that no resampling is required
if:
      (1)   The Authority performs sampling at the industrial user at a
frequency of at least once per month; or
      (2)   The Authority performs sampling at the industrial user between the
time when the industrial user performs its initial sampling and the time when
the industrial user receives the results of this sampling.
   (f)   If sampling performed by the Authority, in lieu of the industrial
user, indicates a violation, the Authority shall repeat the sampling and
analysis within 30 days of becoming aware of the violation unless it notifies
the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat sampling
and analysis.
   (g)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements of this
chapter monitors any pollutant more frequently then required by the Authority,
using the procedures prescribed in divisions (a) through (e), the results of
this monitoring shall be included in the report.

INDUSTRIAL WASTE SURCHARGES
§ 1044.31 SURCHARGE REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Normal concentrations. All persons discharging industrial waste into
the public sewers shall be subjected to a surcharge, in addition to any other
sewer-service charges, if these wastes have a concentration greater than the
following normal concentrations:
      (1)   A five-day, 20°C biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) concentration of
250 parts per 1,000,000;
      (2)   A suspended solids concentration of 300 parts per 1,000,000;
      (3)   A phosphorous (measured as P) concentration of 20 parts per
1,000,000;
      (4)   An ammonia (measured as N) concentration of 15 parts per 1,000,000;
or
      (5)   An oil and grease (hexane extractable or suitable alternative
solvent) concentration of 100 parts per 1,000,000.
(Ord. 1998-21, passed 2-2-1998; Ord. 2002-32, passed 2-4-2002; Ord. 2010-89,
passed 4-19-2010)
   (b)   Items contained in surcharge. The amount of surcharge shall reflect
the cost incurred by the city in removing the excess biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), suspended solids, phosphates, ammonia, and oil and grease of the waste
load. This surcharge may include a proportionate share of the following:
      (1)   Fixed charges and amortization costs for the sewage disposal works
based upon an average useful life of 25 years and an annual interest rate of 5%
and under the assumption that the capital investment will be retired at a
uniform rate throughout the life of the facilities. Such basis of fixed charges
shall be recalculated each five years or at the end of major construction
periods, whichever is shorter; and
      (2)   The annual cost of operation of the sewage treatment plants,
including repairs and maintenance and the cost of administering this chapter.
(Ord. 1991-239, passed 12-2-1991)
§ 1044.32 SURCHARGE COMPUTATION.
   The surcharge per person shall be determined as follows. The excessive
pounds of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, phosphates,
ammonia, and oil and grease will be computed by multiplying the person’s sewage
flow volume in 1,000,000 gallons per day by the constant 8.345 and then
multiplying this product by the difference between the person’s concentrations
of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, phosphates, ammonia, and
oil and grease and the aforementioned normal concentrations in §
1044.31(a) of this chapter in parts per 1,000,000 by weight. The surcharge for
each constituent will then be determined by multiplying the excess pounds of
each constituent by the appropriate rate of surcharge listed in §
1046.04 of this chapter. This product will then be multiplied by the number of
days in the billing period to determine the surcharge. Concentration figures in
the above calculations shall be daily averages determined in accordance with
the provisions of §
1044.18 through
1044.305 of this chapter.

§ 1044.33 SURCHARGE REVIEW AND REVISION.
   The rates of surcharge shall be reviewed and calculated annually in
accordance with the federally approved user charge system by the Approving
Authority in order to determine whether or not they are sufficient to defray
the fixed charges, amortization costs and annual cost of operation as
determined from the sewage treatment plant records. If the difference between
the revenue derived from the rates of surcharge and the total annual cost is
sufficient to justify an increase or decrease in the rates, the Approving
Authority shall make the appropriate change. The rates of surcharge shall be as
set forth in §
1046.04 of this chapter.

chapter, a sum equal to the amount which such parcel of land would have been
assessed under the method of assessment used when the original assessments were
levied.

meter readings based on the historical typical consumption established in the
first and second quarter readings (winter months). If for any reason actual
readings are not available to establish typical use, the program will utilize
the last two actual winter quarter readings. In the case that summer use is
less than historical typical use, no adjustment would be necessary. If an
actual summer reading is not available, the program will default to the last
actual summer reading.

as water meter readings become available, and be due within 30 days after
billing date. Connection charges shall be payable in advance of connection as
provided in §
1046.04. In case of failure to pay any bill for sewer charges when due, a
penalty of 5% of the unpaid account balance shall be added to the bill. If the
bill is not paid by the due date of the next and any subsequent quarter’s bill,
another 5% penalty shall be added for each past due bill.
   (b)   The Director of Finance may abate all or part of any penalties applied
to a sewer billing account(s) if the user(s) can show just cause for non-
payment. Additionally, if a resident can provide evidence that immediate
payment of a past due balance will cause a hardship, the city may provide a
payment plan not to exceed three years. To request an abatement of any and all
penalties, the resident must submit to the Director of Finance the proper
standardized form, together with evidence of hardship.
   (c)   The Director of Finance can waive or delay the application of the
delinquency surcharge for all user accounts for a specific quarterly billing
period if an approval is granted by the Sewer Billing Review Board to make such
a blanket waiver. The Board will provide the Public Works Committee with a copy
of the approval of the blanket waiver.

recommendation to the Council for incorporation into the city ordinances.
   (a)   The system shall result in the distribution of the costs of operation
and maintenance of the treatment works within the Department’s jurisdiction to
each user class in proportion to such user’s contribution to the total
wastewater loading of the treatment works. Factors such as strength, volume and
delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included as the
basis for the user’s contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of
operation and maintenance, including replacement costs, to each user’s class.
   (b)   The system of charges shall be reviewed annually and revised
periodically to reflect actual treatment works operation and maintenance costs.
   (c)   The system of charges shall generate sufficient revenue to offset the
costs of all treatment works operation and maintenance provided by the
Department and such other expenditures that may be authorized.

the satisfaction of the Approving Authority, in order to convert the same into
acceptable industrial wastes. Failure to do so within 30 days after written
notice, or within such other longer period of time as may be specified by the
Approving Authority, shall serve as authority for the Approving Authority, with
the concurrence of the Mayor, to take whatever steps are necessary to prevent
the nonacceptable industrial wastes from being discharged into the sewer
system.
   (b)   If the nonacceptable industrial wastes are such that they may cause
imminent danger of injury or damage to persons or property, the Approving

equipment, and shall require, on forms to be provided by the Chief, relevant
information as may be deemed necessary by the Chief to protect the integrity
and confidentiality of alarm systems. The Chief shall issue a permit to a

Police and/or Fire Department, nor when the cause has been proven to be an act
of God.
   (d)   A grace period of 30 days from the date of installation shall be
granted to new permittees. During this period, no false alarms shall be counted
towards the three allowable false alarms before charges are assessed.

§ 1222.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   The Major Street Plan is a map showing a system of vehicular
circulation, comprised of the present and proposed major streets of the city
and adopted pursuant to law.
   (b)   The general purpose and intent of this chapter shall be to guide the
preparation of major street plans in order to promote safety, convenience,
comfort, prosperity and general welfare and, specifically:
      (1)   To provide a convenient street system to effectively serve the
traffic generated by the residential, business, industrial and other
developments and to facilitate the flow of traffic through and around the city;
      (2)   To coordinate the planning of the municipal streets with adjoining
municipalities and with the county and state highway systems;
      (3)   To establish a system of major streets so as to reduce the use of
local streets for through traffic, thus improving the safety and comfort of the
residents along the local streets;
      (4)   To guide the planning and regulation of land use along the major
streets in order to minimize the marginal interference with the free flow of
traffic, and to protect the developments along such streets from the adverse
effects of concentration of traffic;
      (5)   To establish the location and width of major streets to obtain the
dedication of adequate rights-of-way when the land is subdivided and to guide
the planning of local streets in residential, business and industrial
subdivisions;
      (6)   To provide a framework for the study and preparation of more
detailed neighborhood street plans and mapped street plats and establish a
program for reserving and acquiring rights-of-way; and
      (7)   To provide a basis for making street improvements in accordance
with a capital improvement program.
(Ord. 1962-16, passed 2-19-1962)
§ 1222.02 ADOPTION OF PLAN.
   (a)   Whenever the Planning Commission adopts a master plan or progresses in
its master planning to where it has determined a land use plan for residential,
business, industrial, public and other land uses, the density of population,
the intensity of developments and estimated the volume, origin and destination
of traffic to be generated by the future development, it is empowered to
prepare and adopt a Major Street Plan in accordance with the regulations and
procedures established herein. The Major Street Plan may be an element of the
master or comprehensive plan or a separate plan. The Major Street Plan shall be
adopted by the Planning Commission as a whole by a resolution; thereafter the
Plan may be amended by successive resolutions by the Commission, covering
successive parts of the Plan.
   (b)   Before the adoption of the Plan, or any amendment thereto, the
Commission shall hold at least one public hearing on the proposal and shall
give at least 30 days’ notice of the time, place and purpose thereof in a
newspaper of general circulation in the city. A copy of the plan shall be on
display in the meeting room of the Commission during such period.
(Ord. 1962-16, passed 2-19-1962)
§ 1222.03 SCOPE AND CONTENTS.
   (a)   The Major Street Plan shall encompass the system of vehicular
circulation for the entire city and all the surrounding territory as may be
affected.
   (b)   The Major Street Plan shall be prepared at a scale of 1,000 feet to
one inch or a more detailed scale, and show, but not be limited to, the
following:
      (1)   The presently dedicated streets of all classifications;
      (2)   The general location and rights-of-way of all planned streets and
facilities, such as:
         A.   Freeways, expressways and other types of controlled-access
highways;
         B.   Major and secondary streets; parkways;
         C.   Street extensions, widenings, narrowings, vacations;
         D.   Right-of-way width proposed; route numbers;
         E.   Grade separations at railroads and intersections of streets; and
         F.   Improvements at intersections of streets.
      (3)   Certificates of approval, scale, legend, north point.
(Ord. 1962-16, passed 2-19-1962)
§ 1222.04 EFFECT OF ADOPTION.
   (a)   Public improvements and public land.
      (1)   Whenever the Planning Commission has adopted a Major Street Plan,
no street, bridge or other public way and no public utility, whether publicly
or privately owned, shall be constructed or be authorized to be constructed in
the city or planned portion thereof, and no real property shall be acquired for
street purposes by the city until and unless the location and extent thereof
shall have been submitted to and approved by the Commission.
      (2)   The widening, narrowing, relocation, vacation or change in the use
of any street or other public way or ground or the sale of any public real
property which has been acquired for street purposes or located within the
mapped street lines shall be subject to the same submission and approval.
      (3)   In case of disapproval, the Commission shall communicate its
reasons therefor to Council and to the head of the department which has control
of the construction of the proposed improvement. Council, by a vote of not less
than two-thirds of its members and of such department head, together may
overrule such disapproval. Upon such overruling, Council shall have power to
proceed. The failure of the Commission to act within 30 days after the date of
official submission to it shall be deemed approval, unless a longer period be
granted by Council or other submitting public agency.
   (b)   Subdivision of land. Whenever the Planning Commission has adopted a
Major Street Plan and Council has adopted Subdivision Regulations, then no plat
of a subdivision of land within the city shall be recorded until it has been
approved by the Commission. The Commission may require the dedication of the
rights-of-way for any street within the subdivision and the widening of present
streets at the width shown on the Major Street Plan.
   (c)   Preparation of neighborhood street plans and mapped street plats.
Whenever the Planning Commission has adopted a Major Street Plan, the
Commission shall have the power to make studies and prepare neighborhood street
plans and mapped street plats.
   (d)   Control of access. If the county, city or state has established
regulations controlling the location, use, number, width, grade, relation to
other intersections, or any other design features of private driveway
connections to major or secondary streets in order to minimize the marginal
interference with the free flow of traffic and to protect the developments
along such streets, approval shall be required for driveways connecting to the
streets, as may be designated on the Major Street Plan.

openings for local streets along strip roadside development and to promote the
economical development of the land.
(Ord. 1962-67, passed 6-4-1962)
§ 1224.02 ADOPTION OF PLAN.
   (a)   Whenever a Major Street Plan has been adopted and street plans of a
neighborhood have been studied and prepared, the Commission shall hold at least
one public hearing on the recommended Plan, or any amendment thereto, and shall
give public notice of the time, place and purpose thereof in the manner
prescribed by R.C. § 713.12 or any other similarly designed or intended
statutory enactment. A copy of the Plan shall be on display in the Municipal
Building during such period. After such hearing, the Commission may adopt or
reject the Plan or may modify it.
   (b)   After approval by resolution, the Commission shall recommend the Plan
to Council. No such Plan which violates, differs from or departs from the Plan
submitted by the Commission shall be adopted before Council shall advertise and
hold a public hearing thereon, after public notice given in the manner
prescribed in the preceding division. The Plan shall not take effect unless the
adopting ordinance is passed by not less than three-fourths of the membership
of Council. Thereafter, the Plan may be amended by successive resolutions and/
or ordinances covering parts of the Plan.
(Ord. 1962-67, passed 6-4-1962)
§ 1224.03 SCOPE AND CONTENTS.
   (a)   The Neighborhood Street Plan shall encompass a system of vehicular and
pedestrian circulation of a neighborhood, and may include drainage and public
lands.
   (b)   The Plan shall be prepared at a scale of 400 feet to the inch or a
more detailed scale, and show, but be not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Presently dedicated streets, topographic and physical data:

§ 1224.04 EFFECT OF ADOPTION.
   (a)   Whenever a Neighborhood Street Plan has been duly adopted, the
location of any street and the layout of any subdivision of land proposed
within the boundaries of the Plan shall substantially conform to the local
street pattern shown thereon as well as complying with the provisions of the
Subdivision Regulations of the city. Although the street pattern of any
proposed subdivision may vary from the approved pattern, the underlying system
of vehicular and pedestrian circulation, including the general direction and
extent of the streets and their relationship to the topography, shall be
reflected on the subdivision plan.
   (b)   It shall be construed that a purpose of the Neighborhood Street Plan
is to encourage the developer to prepare alternative subdivision plans for
consideration by the city. Any drainage system and any land designated for
public use upon a Neighborhood Street Plan shall be reserved and be in general
accord with the Plan.
   (c)   Furthermore, whenever a Neighborhood Street Plan has been duly
adopted, the Commission may prepare a mapped street plat of those streets or

§ 1226.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of a mapped street plat, as defined in §
1220.08(b), is to designate and describe the exact right-of-way lines of mapped
streets, the land vital for future street purposes. It is intended that land so
designated can be reserved and acquired before the surrounding area is
developed, thus assuring land in the proper locations for future streets to
fully serve the area and community.
(Ord. 1962-67, passed 6-4-1962)
§ 1226.02 ADOPTION OF PLAT.
   (a)   Whenever a Major Street Plan or a Neighborhood Street Plan has been
duly adopted, the Commission may prepare mapped street plats at such times and
in such sequence as it deems proper to reserve land for future use for streets.
Whenever the Commission has made and certified to Council a mapped street plat,
or amendment thereof, showing any mapped street line, Council shall hold a
public hearing thereon, notice of the time and place of which shall be given in
the manner prescribed by R.C. § 713.12 or any other similarly designed or
intended statutory enactment.
   (b)   After such hearing, Council may adopt or reject the mapped street plat
or may modify it. If the Commission disagrees with a modification proposed by
Council, the modified plat may be adopted only by at least a three-fourths vote
of the membership of Council. After the adoption of the mapped street plat, the
Clerk of Council shall transmit one attested copy of the adopted plat to the
County Recorder who shall place it on the public records.
   (c)   The resolution of adoption of the plat shall set forth the purpose of
the action, the necessity for the future street and the effective period of the
plat. The effective period shall not exceed ten years, but the plat may be
readopted or revised at any time by the same procedures as for the original.
The making or the certifying of a plat by the Commission, or the adoption of a
plat by the Commission, shall not constitute the opening or establishment of
any street or the taking or acceptance of any land for street purposes.
(Ord. 1962-67, passed 6-4-1962)
§ 1226.03 SCOPE AND CONTENT.
   (a)   A plat shall be prepared for each street, or part thereof, which is to
be reserved for future use for streets, drainageways or other public land. The
plat shall be drawn at a scale of sufficient detail to show with appropriate
dimensions the exact location of the mapped street lines and the land needed
for slopes and drainage, or other public use.
   (b)   The plat shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following
information, which shall be deemed a satisfactory description:
      (1)   The present property and streets:
         A.   The lot lines and recorded dimensions of the parcel, or relevant
part thereof, which is traversed by the mapped street; the permanent parcel
number;
         B.   The lines of the abutting street to which the mapped street is
connected; and
         C.   The location of any nearby building that may be affected.
      (2)   The mapped street and other public land:
         A.   The location and extent of the mapped street, or other public
land, or that part thereof which is recommended to be reserved and acquired;
         B.   Dimensions in relation to a lot line of a parcel of record,
dimension and angle to a dedicated street and other reference points as may be
necessary to locate the property in relation to prevailing records; and
         C.   The extent of remnants of the parcel or parcels, not included
within the mapped lines.
      (3)   Titles and certificates:
         A.   Title, north point, scale; and
         B.   Certificates of recommendation by the Commission, of adoption by
Council and provisions for recording.
(Ord. 1962-67, passed 6-4-1962)
§ 1226.04 EFFECT OF ADOPTION.
   (a)   Whenever any person interested, either because of ownership or
occupation, in any land located between the mapped lines of any street as shown
on a recorded mapped street plat adopted by Council, applies for a permit for
the erecting of a building or for altering or moving a building located on land
within the mapped street lines, the Planning Director shall certify to Council
within ten days after application for a certificate of zoning compliance is
received that the proposed building, or part thereof, is within the lines
established on a mapped street plat and in conflict with the Major Street or
Neighborhood Street Plan.
   (b)   Whenever any person so interested applies for the approval of a
subdivision and such application proposes to subdivide land within any mapped
street lines, the Planning Commission shall review the plan of the proposed
subdivision, considering also the Subdivision Regulations of the city and, if
the proposed subdivision cannot be approved as conforming to the mapped street
plat, the Commission shall, within 30 days after such application is received,
certify to Council that the proposed subdivision, or part thereof, is within
the lines established on a mapped street plat and in conflict with the Major
Street or Neighborhood Street Plan.
   (c)   Council shall, within 90 days after receipt of such certification from
the Planning Director, or from the Planning Commission relative to the approval
of a subdivision, or such further time as agreed between Council and the
applicant, acquire the property or any part thereof, including remnant areas of
the same property outside the boundaries of the mapped street line through
dedication or purchase, or, upon failing to conclude a settlement, initiate
proceedings to appropriate the property within the mapped street lines on which
the building is proposed to be erected, altered or moved or on which the
subdivision is proposed to be developed, or transmit to the Planning Director
or the Planning Commission a notification that such acquisition at the time of
consideration is not, in its judgment, in the public interest.
   (d)   Upon being notified that Council has determined that such acquisition
is not in the public interest, the Planning Director shall thereupon issue the
certificate of zoning compliance or the Planning Commission shall thereupon
proceed with the review and approval of the proposed subdivision plan in
accordance with the subdivision rules and regulations.

(Ord. 1966-63, passed 6-20-1966; Ord. 2002-15, passed 3-4-2002)
§ 1242.02 PLANNING AND DEVELOPING A SUBDIVISION; PROCEDURE.
   In planning and developing a subdivision, the subdivider or his or her agent
shall in every case pursue the following procedure.
   (a)   Preparation and filing of preliminary plat. The subdivider shall
prepare a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision which shall conform with
the requirements set forth in
Chapter 1244, and shall file with the Secretary an application in writing for
the approval of the preliminary plat, accompanied by 20 blueprints, and one
sepia, at least two weeks prior to the meeting of the Commission at which
action is desired.
(Ord. 1985-48, passed 4-1-1985)
   (b)   Plat to be checked by Commission; copy to Engineer. The preliminary
plat shall be checked by the Commission as to its conformity with any Major
Street Plan in effect at the time of submission of the plat, and with the
principles, standards and requirements hereinafter set forth, and the Secretary
shall transmit a copy of the preliminary plat to the City Engineer for
recommendations concerning matters within his or her jurisdiction.
(Ord. 1976-56, passed 5-17-1976)
   (c)   Notice to adjoining property owners of filing of subdivision plat.
Upon receipt of the preliminary plat of a proposed major subdivision which has
been presented to the Commission for approval, the Commission shall send
notice, by first-class mail, of the filing thereof to property owners within
400 feet of the property boundary of the proposed major subdivision. Upon
receipt of the preliminary plat of a proposed minor subdivision which has been
presented to the Commission for approval, the Commission shall send notice, by
first-class mail, of the filing thereof to adjoining property owners. A
reasonable time, as set forth in the notice, shall be allowed for a reply from
the property owners before action is taken on the preliminary plat by the
Commission. If the applicant is the only adjoining property owner to whom the
notice is to be sent, the requirements of this division (c) may be waived.
(Ord. 2000-123, passed 7-17-2000)
   (d)   Approval or disapproval of plat.
      (1)   The Commission shall approve or disapprove the preliminary plat, or
approve it with modifications, within 180 days of the filing thereof, noting
any changes thereon that are required.
      (2)   The Commission approval shall be confirmed by resolution of
Council, pursuant to §
1242.01(a). One copy shall be returned to the subdivider with the date of the
approval or disapproval endorsed thereon. A similar copy shall also be
transmitted to the City Engineer.
   (e)   Conformity to plans and specifications; performance and maintenance
bond requirements. Upon approval by Council of the preliminary plat, the
subdivider may then secure all necessary permits to proceed with the
improvements required under
Chapter 1250, upon payment of the fees required under §
1240.03. All improvements shall be constructed or installed in strict
accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the City Engineer. No
changes or modifications in the plans or specifications shall be allowed except
upon written authorization of the Engineer. The subdivider shall file with the
city two complete sets of plans and specifications for all improvements,
including any authorized changes or modifications, to be retained by the city
upon completion of the improvements. Prior to the commencing of the required
improvements, the subdivider shall execute and file with the Director of
Finance an agreement and performance bond or equivalent financial guarantee in
the amount determined by Council, in form satisfactory to the Director of Law,
equal to the approximate total cost of such improvements, which shall insure
the city that the improvements shall be completed as planned. The subdivider
shall be further required to file with the Director of Finance a policy of
liability insurance or bond, in an amount determined by the City Engineer,
which shall provide that for a period of five years from commencement of
construction of the subdivision all adjacent and downstream property owners
will be insured for any damage which may be occasioned by increased stormwater
runoff and drainage from the subdivision. If the subdivider elects to commence
construction of dwellings or other structures, making it necessary that a means
of ingress and egress be provided over streets in the subdivision, then the
subdivider shall improve the street prior to the approval of the final plat to
the extent necessary, in the opinion of the Engineer, to provide satisfactory
access to dwellings and structures on the street until such time as the street
is fully improved in accordance with the approved plans and specifications and
with the terms of the performance bond or equivalent financial guarantee. To
ensure that all streets are properly maintained to provide access, the
subdivider shall deposit a cash bond in addition to the performance bond, with
the Director of Finance, in an amount deemed necessary by the Engineer, from
which all current maintenance costs shall be paid until the street is fully
improved, dedication is offered and accepted, and the two-year maintenance bond
required by division (f) hereof is filed. The subdivider may use the cash bond
or any portion of it from time to time to pay for all maintenance expenses, but
if he or she should fail to maintain the street properly, then upon request of
the Engineer, the city may use such bond to perform necessary maintenance upon
giving the subdivider 48 hours written notice by certified mail of its
intention to do so. Any reduction in the amount of the cash bond for the above
listed purposes shall be promptly made up by the developer so as to return the
cash bond to its original amount.
(Ord. 1985-44, passed 5-20-1985)
   (f)   Final plat; certificate of title. Within 90 days after the completion
of all required improvements in accordance with the standards and
specifications of the city pertaining to such improvements and to the written
satisfaction of the City Engineer, the subdivider shall file with the Secretary
an original drawing of ink on polyester drafting film, together with 18 prints,
of the final plat, together with a copy of the surveyor’s calculations for the
subdivision lots and lands and any other data the City Engineer may require to
process the drawing and all meeting the requirements stipulated in
Chapter 1246, and such improvements shall be offered to the city for approval
and acceptance as hereinafter set forth. The approval and acceptance by the
city shall not take place until the subdivider has posted a two-year
maintenance bond in an amount satisfactory to the City Engineer and in a form
approved by the Director of Law, to ensure the city that the improvements shall
be properly maintained for a period of two years after the date of approval and
acceptance by Council. The final plat shall be accompanied by a certificate of
title showing that the ownership of all lands to be dedicated to public use is
free and unencumbered. The final plat shall be filed with the Secretary at
least two weeks prior to the meeting of the Commission at which the action is
desired.
   (g)   Engineer’s report and duties. The City Engineer shall check the final
plat as to computations, certifications, lot areas and numbers, monuments and
the like. If found satisfactory, he or she shall transmit the required copies
of the final plat to the Commission, together with the certificate of title and
a threefold letter stating:
      (1)   That the technical details of the plat itself have been checked and
found satisfactory;
      (2)   That all improvements have been completed in accordance with the
standards and specifications of the city and to his or her satisfaction; and
      (3)   A.   That the subdivider has posted the required maintenance bond
which shall extend for two years from the date of approval and acceptance by
Council.
         B.   Ninety days prior to the expiration of any bond referred to in
this chapter, the Engineer shall so advise the Mayor, Council and the Planning
Commission and provide them with a written report as to the status of the
subdivision and particularly that portion effected by the bond about to expire.
A copy of this report shall be sent to the developer or owner.
   (h)   Approval of final plat. After the final plat, together with such
certificates, has been received, and provided that the final plat is found to
conform with the preliminary plat as approved and with the requirements set
forth in these Regulations, the Commission shall give the final plat its final
approval and endorse the same thereon. Ten prints shall be transmitted by the
Commission to Council for necessary action on any proposed acceptance and
dedication. The original drawing shall then be endorsed and shall be
immediately returned to the subdivider. The final plat of the subdivision so
approved shall then be filed for record by the developer in the office of the
Recorder of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, no later than 60 days after approval by the
city.
   (i)   Approval of final plat for record purposes only. Upon written request
of the subdivider, the Commission may approve a final plat for record purposes
only, before all of the required improvements are installed or secured by the
required performance bond or equivalent financial guarantee, provided that an
appropriate legend is shown on the face of the plat to the effect that such
approval shall not constitute the acceptance of the dedication of any streets,
easements or public grounds shown thereon, and further, that no dwelling,
building or other structure may be erected on any lot until all of the
improvements required under this Planning and Zoning Code have been installed
and approved or a satisfactory performance bond or equivalent financial
guarantee has been filed to ensure such installation.
(Ord. 1982-52, passed 11-15-1982)
§ 1242.03 RESTRICTIONS ON COMMISSION’S APPROVALS.
   (a)   It is suggested that the subdivider or his or her engineer consult
with the City Engineer while the plat is in sketch form and before the
preliminary plat is prepared, to ascertain the location and extent of proposed
city streets, parks and other public grounds and of other planned projects and
developments related to the proposed subdivision.
   (b)   The approval of the preliminary plat by the Commission is tentative
and may be revoked within 90 days of the filing thereof, and does not
constitute acceptance of the subdivision. It shall be considered only as an
approval of the layout, with the understanding that the City Engineer will
examine the grades of streets, the types of improvements and the design of the
drainage, sewerage and water systems as proposed, and may modify any
engineering or construction details submitted by the subdivider whenever
required for the protection of the public interest.
   (c)   Approval of the preliminary plat will be effective for one year unless
extended by the Commission.
   (d)   The final plat of any portion of a larger subdivision, the preliminary
plat of which has been approved by the Commission, may be submitted for final
approval.
   (e)   The approval of the final plat by the Commission shall not be deemed
to constitute or effect an acceptance by the public of the dedication of any
street or other proposed public way or space shown on the plat.
   (f)   Approval of the final plat by the Commission shall be null and void if
the plat is not offered for record within 30 days of such approval and accepted
for record within 60 days after the date of approval.
(Ord. 1953-110, passed 12-30-1953)
§ 1242.04 RESPONSIBILITY OF PLANNING COMMISSION.
   In granting approval to any subdivision plat or plats, the Planning
Commission shall give full consideration to the following matters in order to
secure and provide for the coordination of the streets within the subdivision
with existing streets and roads or with the plan or plats of the city; for the
proper amount of open spaces for traffic, circulation and utilities; for the
avoidance of future congestion of population detrimental to the public health
or safety; and for the protection of the community in all aspects, including
drainage, sewers, water and other such aspects of community development; and

roadway therein, without first obtaining approval from the Planning Commission
for such name change, which approval shall be confirmed by resolution of
Council.

§ 1252.01 VARIANCES AND HARDSHIP EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   The general principles of design and the minimum requirements for the
laying out of subdivisions, stipulated in
Chapter 1248, may be varied by the Commission in the case of a subdivision
large enough to constitute a more or less self-contained neighborhood to be
developed in accordance with a comprehensive plan safeguarded by appropriate
restrictions, which, in the judgment of the Commission, make adequate provision
for all essential community requirements; provided, however, that no
modifications shall be granted by the Commission which would conflict with the
proposal of any Major Street Plan in effect at the time of the submission of
the plat, or with the intent and purposes of such general principles of design
and minimum requirements.
   (b)   In any particular case where the subdivider can show that by reason of
exceptional topographic or other physical conditions, strict compliance with
any requirement of these Regulations would cause practical difficulty or
exceptional and undue hardship, the Commission may relax such requirements to
the extent deemed just and proper, so as to relieve such difficulty or
hardship, provided that such relief may be granted without detriment to the
public good and without impairing the intent and purposes of these Regulations,
or the desirable general development of the neighborhood and the community in
accordance with any Major Street Plan in effect at the time of the submission
of the plat, and the Zoning Code. Any modification thus granted shall be
entered in the minutes of the Commission setting forth the reasons which, in
the opinion of the Commission, justified the modification.
   (c)   Any such variance or hardship exception shall be considered only after
proper application has been made pursuant to Chapter 1293 and fees paid
pursuant to Chapter 1295.
   (d)   In cases where a variance is granted, the Secretary of the Planning
Commission shall immediately notify the Planning Director and Council of any
variance granted by the Planning Commission under this section. Council may, at
either of its next two ensuing regular meetings, by motion, take action to
either reverse, affirm or modify the decision of the Planning Commission in any
case where a variance is granted. If no action is taken by Council at its next
two ensuing regular meetings, the decision of the Planning Commission shall be
final. If the variance, as granted by the Planning Commission and reviewed by
Council, contains conditions which are later modified by action of the Planning
Commission, such modification shall be forwarded to Council, and Council may,
at either of its next two ensuing regular meetings, by motion, take action to
either reverse, affirm or modify the decision of the Planning Commission in any
case where a modification of a condition is granted. If no action is taken by
Council at its next two ensuing regular meetings, the decision of the Planning
Commission shall be final.
   (e)   Any person adversely affected by any final decision of the Planning
Commission concerning a variance in the application of ordinances, resolutions,
regulations, measures and orders governing zoning in the municipality, may,
within 14 days after the date of the Clerk’s notification to the applicant,
appeal said decision to Council. Notice of the Commission’s decision shall be
sent by the Clerk by certified mail to the applicant. To the extent that it is
reasonable and practical, within 30 days after receipt of the appeal, the
Council shall hear and decide said appeal in accordance with standards and
procedures established by Council. If no action is taken by Council within the
30-day period for Council’s review, the decision of the Planning Commission
shall be final.

scale showing the proposed subdivision and such other information as is
pertinent to its determination and action thereon under these Regulations;
(Ord. 1955-16, passed 2-17-1955)
   (d)   If the Planning Commission is satisfied that such proposed subdivision
is not contrary to other applicable subdivision or zoning regulations, it may,
after notice and hearing, at a regular meeting, approve such subdivision, shall
stamp the same “Approved by City Planning Commission of the City of Solon: No
Plat Required,” and shall have it signed by the Secretary of the Commission. If
the applicant is the only adjoining property owner to whom the notice is to be
sent, the notice and hearing requirements of this subdivision may be waived;
and
(Ord. 2000-124, passed 7-17-2000)
   (e)   The Secretary of the Planning Commission shall immediately notify
Council of the action taken by the Planning Commission set forth in division
(d) hereof. Council may, at its next ensuing regular meeting, reverse or modify
the action of the Planning Commission by the affirmative vote of not fewer than
five members of Council. If no action is taken by Council at its next ensuing
regular meeting, the approval of the Planning Commission shall be final.
(Ord. 1978-37, passed 5-22-1978)
§ 1252.03 NOTIFICATION OF ADJUSTMENTS TO LOT BOUNDARIES.
   Whenever the City Engineer receives a request by a property owner for an
adjustment to the lot boundary, which adjustment is not of the type which would
require the review and approval by the Planning Commission, the City Engineer
shall, prior to approving the adjustment to the lot boundary, immediately
notify Council and the Planning Commission of his or her intent to approve the
adjustment to the lot boundary and, if no action is taken by either Council or

(Ord. 2015-153, passed 9-19-2016)
§ 1254.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for
each construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The
SWP3 must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization).
   (b)   The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-
sediment pollution controls contained therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction. Perimeter controls must be installed two working
days prior to commencement of construction. The approved plan must be
implemented until the site reaches final stabilization. All properties adjacent
to the site of soil-disturbing activity shall be protected from soil erosion
and sediment run-off and damage, including, but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public
lands.
   (c)   It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of
contractor(s) responsible for implementation of the SWP3 and providing that
information to the city. The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact storm water runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3. The applicant shall review the SWP3 with the primary contractor prior
to commencement of construction activities and keep a SWP3 training log to
demonstrate that this review had occurred.
   (d)   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and
maintained effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the
course of earth disturbing activities. The controls shall include the following
minimum components:
      (1)   Non-structural preservation measures. The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree preservation areas
or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil compaction shall be
minimized and, unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and
maintain a 50-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the state, or riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever
is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible (e.g., stream
crossings for roads or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation
and restoration). Direct stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment
removal and maximize stormwater infiltration.
      (2)   Erosion control practices. The SWP3 must make use of erosion
controls that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. The amount
of soil exposed during construction activity shall be minimized. A description
of control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover. Erosion control practices must meet the following
requirements:
         A.   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
 
Table 1: Permanent Stabilization
Area Requiring Permanent Stabilization Timeframe to Apply Erosion Controls
Any area that will lie dormant for one Within seven days of the most recent
year or more                           disturbance
Any area within 50 feet of surface     Within two days of reaching final grade
water of the state and at final grade
Any other areas at final grade         Within seven days of reaching final
                                       grade within that area

For all construction activities, any   Within seven days of the most recent
disturbed area, including soil         disturbance within the area
stockpiles that will be dormant for    For residential subdivisions, disturbed
more than 14 days but less than one    areas must be stabilized at least 7 days

Disturbed areas that will be idle over Prior to November 1 or the onset of
winter                                 winter weather, whichever occurs first
Note:   Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, as determined by the City Engineer,
alternative stabilization techniques may be employed. This includes areas that
will be idle over the winter and stabilization prior to November 1 is not
possible.
 
         B.   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, step pools, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent
edition of Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide
available at www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
      (3)   Runoff control practices. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent
erosion. Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to
minimize erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable and shall at the same time not divert runoff to an adjacent
property per Section
1250.20. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge locations
and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive flow
velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical and
biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
      (4)   Sediment control practices. The SWP3 shall include a description
of, and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store
runoff, allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed
soils or otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas to minimize sediment
discharges from the site. Structural practices shall be used to control erosion
and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days. Such
practices may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences,
storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which
direct runoff to a sediment settling pond. The design, installation and
maintenance of erosion and sediment controls shall address factors such as the
amount, frequency, intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of
resulting stormwater runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of
soil particle sizes expected to be present on the site.
      (5)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are
not considered a sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a
sediment settling pond. Sediment control practices must meet the following
requirements:
         A.   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional
throughout the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and
perimeter sediment barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within
seven days from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until
the up slope development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and
the topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing
controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
         B.   Sediment settling ponds.
            1.   A sediment settling pond, or equivalent best management
practice upon approval from the City Engineer is required for any one of the
following conditions:
               a.   Concentrated storm water runoff;
               b.   Runoff from drainage areas that exceeds the design capacity
of silt fence (see Table 3) or inlet protection, or other sediment barriers;
               c.   Runoff from common drainage locations with ten or more
acres of disturbed land.
            2.   Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the form of a
sediment trap or sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Rainwater
and Land Development. The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a
sediment trap shall be limited to less than five acres. Contributing drainage
areas of five acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin. An
equivalent best management practice may be utilized upon approval from the
city.
            3.   The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment
storage zone and a dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be
at least 1,800 cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage
area. The dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a
minimum 48-hour drain time, and, unless infeasible, be designed to always
withdraw runoff from the surface of the pond throughout the storm cycle. As
such, a skimmer discharge device consistent with Rainwater and Land Development
shall be provided to dewater sediment basins. Sediment traps shall also provide
both a sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet structure
shall be constructed consistent with the specifications contained in the latest
edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
            4.   When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be
used as temporary sediment trapping BMPs, a skimmer discharge device consistent
with Rainwater and Land Development shall be utilized during construction phase
and until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the city.
            5.   The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements
of sediment basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of
the pond provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering
zone. As such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be
no discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage
zone and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only
occur through the skimmer.
            6.   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by
one of the following methods:
               Method 1: The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1,000
ft3 per disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
               Method 2: The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the
volume necessary to store the sediment as calculated with the Revised Universal
Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) or other generally accepted erosion protection
model.
            7.   When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-
site areas and areas which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be
included unless runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment
settling pond and is not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of
the dewatering zone must be less than or equal to five feet. The configuration
between the inlets and the outlet of the sediment-settling pond must provide at
least two units of length for each one unit of width ≥ 2:1 length-to-width
ratio; however a length to width ratio of ≥ 4:1 is recommended. Sediment must
be removed from the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity of the
sediment storage zone has been completely filled by sediment accumulations.
This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin
depth. When designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider
public safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the
sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment
and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is
encouraged.
         C.   Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, and water resources from sediment transported via sheet flow. Where
intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on a level
contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The relationship
between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is
shown in Table 3 below. Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend
the size of the permissible drainage area.
 
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence Based on Slope
Maximum Drainage Area (Acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a Drainage Area (%)
Linear Feet of Silt Fence
0.50                                 <2%
0.25                                 ≥ 2% but < 20%
0.125                                ≥ 20% but < 50%
 
         D.   Alternative perimeter controls for sheet flow discharges may be
considered by the city, but their use shall not exceed the limitations
indicated in Table 3 above. Detail drawings and plan notes shall specify the
diameter of filter socks, compost berms and other such alternative perimeter
controls if used instead of silt fence.
         E.   Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten acres.
         F.   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond. Straw or hay
bales and filter socks around catch basins are not acceptable forms of inlet
protection, unless directed by the City Engineer or if conditions warrant it.
         G.   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control.
            1.   Best management practices must be implemented to ensure
sediment is not tracked off-site and that dust is controlled. These best
management practices must include, but are not limited to, the following:
               a.   One construction entrance shall be built and shall serve as
the only permitted point of ingress and egress to the development area. This
entrance shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled
concrete or cement sized greater than two inches in diameter, placed over a
geotextile fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the
most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
               b.   Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances
shall be kept free of sediment tracked off site. Streets directly adjacent to a
construction entrance and receiving traffic from the development area, shall be
cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrance shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
            2.   Based on site conditions, the City Engineer and/or the
Cuyahoga SWCD as directed by the City Engineer may require additional best
management practices to control off site tracking and dust. These additional
BMPs may include:
               a.   Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
               b.   Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas. Wash water from
these areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-
settling pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with division
(d)(7) of this section. No surfactants or detergents may be used to wash
vehicles.
               c.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The City Engineer may require dust
controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed areas, tarping
stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation of the
speed of vehicles on the site.
         H.   Surface waters of the state protection. Construction vehicles
shall avoid water resources. A 50 foot undisturbed natural buffer shall be
provided around surface waters of the state unless infeasible. If it is
infeasible to provide and maintain an undisturbed 50-foot natural buffer, the
SWP3 shall comply with the stabilization requirements in division (d)(2)A. of
this section for areas within 50 feet of a surface water and minimize soil
compaction and, unless infeasible, preserve topsoil. If the applicant is
permitted to disturb areas within 50 feet of a water resource, the following
conditions shall be addressed in the SWP3:
            1.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified
in the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
            2.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on
site to protect water resources from the impacts of sediment runoff.
            3.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of
silt fence or in-stream sediment settling pond) shall be used in water
resources or wetlands.
            4.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary
and permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
            5.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
            6.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control
structures shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or
close to the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough,
slip, or erode.
            7.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands. The flow should
be released such that no erosion occurs downslope. Level spreaders may need to
be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
            8.   Protected areas or critical areas, including wetlands and
riparian areas shall be physically marked in the field prior to earth
disturbing activities.
         I.   Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
      (5)   Non-sediment pollutant controls. No solid or liquid waste,
including building materials, shall be discharged in stormwater runoff. The
applicant must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic
materials, hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources,
wetlands or the MS4. These practices shall include but are not limited to the
following:
         A.   Waste materials. A covered dumpster shall be made available for
the proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other
waste materials.
         B.   Concrete truck washout. The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, other public facility, natural resource or water of the
state is prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available.
         C.   Disposal of other wastewaters. The discharge of washout and
cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other
construction materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural
resource or waters of the state is prohibited. The discharge of soaps or
solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited. If
generated, these wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
         D.   Fuel/liquid tank storage. All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall
be stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest
containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall be provided to clean up
spills. The SWP3 shall contain spill prevention and response procedures and
these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-construction meeting.
         E.   Toxic or hazardous waste disposal. Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly. The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
         F.   Contaminated soils disposal and runoff.
            1.   Discovery of previously unknown contaminated soils onsite
shall be self-reported to Ohio EPA and local authorities. Contaminated soils
from redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from
contaminated soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall
be obtained for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or
redevelopment sites. Where construction activities are to occur on sites with
contamination from previous activities, operators shall be aware that
concentrations of materials that meet other criteria (i.e. not considered a
hazardous waste, meeting voluntary action program (VAP) standards) may still
result in stormwater discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality Standards. Such
discharges are not authorized by this code. Control measures which may be
utilized to meet this requirement include, but are not limited to:
               a.   Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated
runoff and prevent discharge;
               b.   Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer
with the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
               c.   Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or
other such methods to prevent storm water from coming into contact with
contaminated materials.
            2.   The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure of
building materials, building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape
materials, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste
to precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Applicants may
also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., spill prevention control and
countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, safety response plans,
etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such
plan is maintained on site.
      (6)   Compliance with other requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent
with applicable state and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic
system regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open
burning, and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils
located within the development area.
      (7)   Trench and ground water control. There shall be no sediment-laden
or turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
      (8)   Internal inspections.  
         A.   All controls on the site shall be inspected at least once every
seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-
half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection frequency may be reduced
to at least once every month if the entire site is temporarily stabilized or
runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g., site is covered with snow,
ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of inspection requirements is available
until one month before thawing conditions are expected to result in a discharge
if prior written approval has been attained from the City Engineer and/or
Cuyahoga County SWCD as directed by the City Engineer and all of the following
conditions are met:
            1.   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one
month).
            2.   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
            3.   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
         B.   The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to
conduct these inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional
and to evaluate whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control
measures are required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with
knowledge and experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and
erosion controls. A copy of all reports shall be forwarded to the city
Engineering Department. All inspection reports shall be kept on file for a
period of three years following final stabilization of the site.
         C.   These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
            1.   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that
are exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the
potential for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
            2.   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3
shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant
shall utilize an inspection form provided by the city or an alternate form
acceptable to the City Engineer. The inspection form shall include:
               a.   The inspection date.
               b.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
               c.   Weather information for the period since the last
inspection, including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event,
duration of each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm
event in inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
               d.   Weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of inspection.
               e.   Locations of:
                  i.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
                  ii.   BMPs that need to be maintained.
                  iii.   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved
inadequate for a particular location.
                  iv.   Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at
the time of inspection.
               f.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes
to the SWP3 and implementation dates.
            3.   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
            4.   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be
inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
            5.   The applicant shall maintain for three years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non-compliance determined by these inspections.
      (9)   Maintenance.  
         A.   The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance requirements.
All BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure continued
performance of their intended function until final stabilization. All sediment
control practices must be maintained in a functional condition until all up
slope areas they control reach final stabilization. The applicant shall provide
a description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the continued
performance of control practices and shall ensure a responsible party and
adequate funding to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the City
Engineer.
         B.   When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or
installation of erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures
shall be followed:
            1.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance. If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten days of the inspection.
            2.   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function. If an
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be
installed within ten days of the inspection as determined by the City Engineer
or duly authorized representative.
            3.   When BMPs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an
internal inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in accordance
with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within ten days
from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection reveals that the
planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
      (10)   Final stabilization. Final stabilization shall be determined by
the City Engineer or their duly authorized representative. Once a definable
area has achieved final stabilization, the applicant may note this on the SWP3
and no further inspection requirement applies to that portion of the site.
Final stabilization also requires the installation of permanent (post-
construction) stormwater control measures (SCMs). Obligations under this
chapter shall not be completed until installation of post-construction BMPs is
verified.

§ 1257.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city.
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or redevelop their
property within the city to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
Stormwater Control Measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed and
maintained;
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities;
      (3)   Control the volume, rate and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and ground water are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased;
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair and replace subsurface storm
drain systems;
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage-
prone soils;
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process;
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management;
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes, including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation and habitat preservation;
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the

§ 1257.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General. The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to minimize structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows and volumes; meet or exceed the city's stormwater design
standards for stormwater management; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources.
         A.   The SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls
flooding and minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological and chemical
integrity of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site.
Acceptable practices shall:
            1.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on
as much of the site as practicable;
            2.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use;
            3.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new
impervious surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to
less than predevelopment levels; and
            4.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by the city.
         B.   SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional
criteria required by the City Engineer, shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use. SCMs shall be designed to achieve
the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be compatible with
the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the public health,
safety and welfare, and to function safely with routine maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots. Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Chapter 1242, shall provide stormwater management
for the development of all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for
lot grading and drainage that minimize structure flooding during the 100-year,
24-hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development
runoff patterns, volumes and peaks from each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources. SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
United States Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state and local
agencies as required in §
1257.07, and the activity is in compliance with
Chapter 1254, all as determined by the City Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds, surface conveyance channels and underground
detention. All stormwater pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a
minimum of one and one-half foot freeboard above the projected peak stage
within the facility during the 100-year, 24-hour storm. Underground detention
systems, at a minimum, shall provide 1.1 times the required 100-year detention
volume. When designing stormwater ponds, conveyance channels and underground
detention, the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and
alternative designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a
safe design.
      (6)   Exemption. The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of this section if it can be shown to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer that the site is part of a larger common plan
of development where the stormwater management requirements for the site are
provided by an existing SCM, or if the stormwater management requirements for
the site are provided by practices defined in a regional or local stormwater
management plan approved by the city.
      (7)   Maintenance. All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with §
1257.08 and/or 1288.02.
      (8)   Ownership. Unless otherwise required by the city, SCMs serving
multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and maintained by
an entity of common ownership. SCMs serving single lots shall be placed on
these lots, protected within an easement and maintained by the property owner.
      (9)   Preservation of existing natural drainage. Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas and
existing vegetation; vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and
grubbing practices; and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and
through these areas. Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide
perpetual management of runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving
stream's physical, chemical and biological characteristics are protected and
ecological functions are maintained.
   (b)   Stormwater conveyance design criteria. All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
inflow velocities. This shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   Surface water protection. The City Engineer may allow modification
to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only if the
applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio
EPA, the United States Army Corps and other applicable federal, state and local
agencies as required in § 1257.07, and the activity is in compliance with
Chapter 1254, all as determined by the City Engineer. At a minimum, stream
relocation designs must show how the project will minimize changes to the
vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form and habitat of upstream and
downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges. Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that off-site
runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a manner
that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow. The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed one and one-half acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel,
storm sewer or other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to maintain
sheet flow, all as determined by the City Engineer.
      (4)   Storm sewer systems. Open drainage systems to convey stormwater
overland to SCMs may be allowed with approval of the City Engineer. The
following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems.
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 10-year, 24-hour storm and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway or below the top of the drainage structures outside the roadway during
a 25-year, 24-hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these
requirements when conveying the flows from the contributing drainage area
within the proposed development and existing flows from off-site areas that are
upstream from the development.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems shall be 12 inches.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins and junctions within the system.
         D.   Full height headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets
or outlets to and from open channels, ponds or lakes.
         E.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
      (5)   Water resource crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the city.
         A.   Water resource crossings, other than bridges, shall be designed
to convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25-year, 24-hour storm. The water
surface elevation shall be no less than one foot from the finished edge of
pavement or top of curb.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all state scenic rivers, cold
water habitat, exceptional warm water habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these bridges
and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, 25% of the
cross-sectional area or a minimum of one foot of box culverts and pipe arches
must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or conveyance must to be
sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10-
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Full height headwalls and integral concrete outfall pads shall be
required at all culvert inlets or outlets to and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of five square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100-year,
24-hour storm or the 100-year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (6)   Overland flooding. Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (7)   Velocity dissipation. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater quality control. The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more SCMs that meet or exceed the criteria in the most current
Ohio EPA Construction General Permit.
   (d)   Stormwater quantity control. The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development.
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the critical storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
critical storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rate no greater than the peak runoff rate from a 5-year, 24-hour
storm under pre-development conditions. The 1-, 2-, 5-,10-, 25-, 50- and 100-
year storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this
requirement.
      (3)   The critical storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydrologic method approved by the City Engineer, the total volume (acre-feet)
of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development drainage
area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the following
standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build-out as proposed;
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area;
            3.   Model pervious, directly connected impervious and disconnected
impervious areas as separate subwatersheds;
            4.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type;
            5.   Rainfall depth - Use the Huff & Angel 1992 "Rainfall Frequency
Atlas of the Midwest";
            6.   Temporal distribution - Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than one
year. Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition;
            7.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition must reflect
the current land use or as determined soley by the city; and
            8.   Time of concentration - Use velocity based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
               a.   Maximum sheet flow length is 300 feet.
               b.   Use the appropriate "unpaved" velocity equation for shallow
concentrated flow from Soil Conservation Service National Engineer Handbook
Section 4 - Hydrology (NEH-4).
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description. From the volume determined in division (d)(3)A. hereof, determine
the percent increase in volume of runoff due to development. Using the
percentage, select the 24-hour critical storm from Table 3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff
is:                                               The Critical Storm will be:
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:
—                       10                      1 year
10                        20                      2 year
20                        50                      5 year
50                        100                     10 year
100                       250                     25 year
250                       500                     50 year
500                       —                     100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms will
be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for a 5 year
storm.
 
   (e)   Stormwater management on redevelopment projects. SCM's on previously
developed sites shall meet or exceed the criteria in the most current Ohio EPA
Construction General Permit.

areas and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these practices must
be stabilized within two days.

   (a)   Before proceeding with the construction, enlargement, alteration,
repair or removal of any building, other structure or appurtenances, including
driveways, a permit shall first be obtained by the owner and/or his or her
agent from the Chief Building Official and/or City Engineer. The application
shall be made in writing and upon forms furnished by the Chief Building
Official and/or City Engineer. It shall, except for removals, be accompanied by
a complete set of specifications, and by a complete set of plans and working
drawings made to a scale of not less than one-eighth of an inch to the foot,
and on Mylar, paper or cloth, in ink or by a process which will not fade or
obliterate. Plans and specifications for buildings or other structures,
excluding industrial, office and commercial facilities, shall be signed by the
owner and his or her agent.
   (b)   When the plans, drawings and specifications are found to conform to
the requirements of this Building and Housing Code, the Chief Building Official
and/or City Engineer shall issue a permit and affix to the plans, drawings and
specifications an official stamp of approval. The plans, drawings and
specifications shall then be returned to the applicant. One copy thereof shall
be filed with the Chief Building Official and/or City Engineer before
commencing the construction and shall remain on file per the City Building
Department’s record of retention requirements. One copy of the plans, drawings
and specifications, having the stamp of the Chief Building Official and/or City
Engineer, is to be kept on the work until completed.

(Ord. 1928-113, passed 3-4-1929)
§ 1424.04 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   When the work for which any building permit was issued is not being
performed in conformity to the detailed statement, plans or specifications upon
which such permit was issued, it shall be the duty of the Chief Building
Official to notify the owner or his or her agent in writing, by posting a
notice on the building for which the permit is issued, that the work is being
constructed in violation of the permit and that such work must be suspended
until a permit for such deviation from the detailed statement, plans or
specifications is obtained, or that such work shall be made to conform to the
detailed statement, plans or specifications upon which a permit therefor was
issued. If the owner or his or her agent fails to comply with the notice on the
posting thereof, it shall be the further duty of the Chief Building Official to
revoke such permit. Written notice of such revocation, signed by the Chief
Building Official, shall be immediately served upon the owner, agent,
superintendent or contractor in charge of the work, or shall be posted on such
premises, and no person shall perform any work in or about such structure,
building or premises after the revocation of the permit and the posting of
notice thereof.
(Ord. 1928-113, passed 3-4-1929)
§ 1424.05 ACCESS REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Building and Housing
Code or ordinances pertaining to buildings, no permit shall be issued by the
Chief Building Official or other authority for the construction of a dwelling,
and no dwelling shall be constructed, where the Chief Building Official shall,
upon investigation, find that there is no way, lane or street, either private
or public, connecting with the public thoroughfare system of the city available
as an ingress to and egress from such proposed dwelling, or that such proposed
means of ingress and egress, either private or public, has insufficient base
and bearing surface, either of gravel, rock or other hard material, to sustain
without difficulty in any season of the year fire apparatus, garbage and refuse
collection trucks, ambulances and other vehicular traffic desiring to reach
such dwelling.
   (b)   Upon the refusal of the Chief Building Official to issue a permit for
the construction of a dwelling, based upon his or her findings concerning the
matters specified herein, the applicant for a permit may, within ten days from
such refusal, file with the Clerk of Council an appeal in writing from such
refusal, and thereupon the Clerk of Council shall transmit such appeal to
Council, which in accordance with its standards and procedures, shall hear such
appeal at its next available meeting date and shall affirm, refuse or modify
the decision of the Chief Building Official as the facts so found by Council
shall justify, or shall grant such permit upon such conditions as it may deem

§ 1424.06 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   (a)   Retail, commercial and industrial certificates. The owner or his or
her agent having charge of the construction of any retail, commercial or
industrial building is prohibited from allowing or permitting such structure to
be occupied, or to have furnishings installed or stored therein, until it has
been finally inspected and approved by the Engineering Department, the Chief
Building Official and, at his or her request, the Fire Chief. In addition to
the foregoing requirements, a change in ownership and/or building tenancy of a
nonresidential building shall require the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy. Such certificate shall not be issued until the Building Department,
and if required, the Fire Department has inspected and approved the building in
accordance with the relevant codified ordinances of the city, and not until the
Planning Director or his or her designee has approved the use in accordance
with the provisions of the City Zoning Code.
   (b)   Residential certificates. The owner or his or her agent having charge
of the construction of any residential dwelling, including a dwelling moved
within or into the city pursuant to a permit issued under
Chapter 1468, is prohibited from allowing or permitting such structure to be
occupied or to have furnishings installed or stored therein until it has been
finally inspected by the Engineering Department, the Chief Building Official
and, at his or her request, the Fire Chief. When the Engineering Department
finds that the final grades, sewers, water lines and drains have been installed
in accordance with the permits issued therefor, and when the Chief Building
Official and Fire Chief find that the structure has been completed in
accordance with the permits issued therefor and all laws and ordinances
applicable thereto, the Chief Building Official shall, upon application, issue
a certificate of occupancy to the person applying therefor. When the
Engineering Department, Chief Building Official and Fire Chief find that the
structure has been substantially completed so as to permit the safe and
healthful occupation of the structure, the Chief Building Official shall, upon
application, issue a temporary certificate of occupancy which shall list the
incomplete items to be completed, within 30 days of issuance, weather
permitting, with regard to exterior punch list items.

ENGINEERING WORK.
   (a)   In addition to the procedures set forth in §§
1424.06 and
1430.02, when various items under the jurisdiction of the Engineering
Department cannot be completed prior to the issuance of a final certificate of
occupancy for residential, retail, commercial and industrial projects because
of inclement weather, the City Engineer may authorize the issuance of a
temporary certificate of occupancy. Said temporary certificate of occupancy
shall be conditioned upon the owner and/or his or her builder making a cash
deposit with the Director of Finance in an amount equal to one and one-half
times the value of the outstanding work, as determined by the City Engineer in
his or her sole discretion. At the time of acceptance of said deposit, the City
Engineer shall provide the owner and/or his or her builder a timetable wherein
the outstanding uncompleted items shall be completed to the satisfaction of the
City Engineer. If the owner and/or his or her builder does not comply with this
timetable, the City Engineer shall recommend forfeiture of all or a portion of
the deposit.
   (b)   The deposit shall be retained by the Director of Finance in a special
fund for the purposes outlined herein, until such time as the City Engineer
certifies that all outstanding items of uncompleted work have been
satisfactorily completed. Upon certification by the City Engineer, the deposit
shall be returned to the person making the deposit, less a fee of $100 to cover
inspection of the work.
   (c)   In the event that the person making the deposit fails to complete the
items of uncompleted work, the city shall make arrangements for such necessary
work and deduct the cost thereof from the deposit. If the deposit is
insufficient to reimburse the city, the Director of Finance shall take the
necessary steps to effect the collection of the remainder of the cost from the
person making the deposit. If the deposit exceeds the cost of such work, the
Director of Finance shall issue a check to return the excess to the person who
made such deposit.

if the street address number is placed on a mailbox at the street line with

§ 1424.09 REVIEW OF BUILDING PERMITS AND SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS FOR FLOOD
HAZARDS.
   (a)   The Chief Building Official and City Engineer shall review all
building permit applications for new construction or substantial improvements
to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from
flooding. If a proposed building site is in a location that has a flood hazard,
any proposed new construction or substantial improvement, including
prefabricated and mobile homes, must:
      (1)   Be designed or modified and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse
or lateral movement of the structure;
      (2)   Use construction materials and utility equipment that is resistant
to flood damage; and
      (3)   Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood
damage.
   (b)   The City Engineer shall review subdivision proposals and other
proposed new developments to assure that:
      (1)   All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage;
      (2)   All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical
and water systems, are located, elevated and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage; and
      (3)   Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood
hazards.
   (c)   The City Engineer shall require new or replacement water supply
systems and/or sanitary sewage systems to be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems
into flood waters, and shall require on-site waste disposal systems to be
located so as to avoid impairment of them or contamination from them during
flooding.

   No permit for the construction of any building shall be issued by the Chief
Building Official except where adequate water supply and facilities for
firefighting purposes are available, as determined by the Fire Chief. If the
Fire Chief finds, upon inspection of any building under construction, that
adequate water supply or facilities for firefighting purposes, as determined by
the Chief, are not being furnished as required, then the Chief Building
Official shall stop such construction and revoke the permit previously issued
therefor until such time as adequate water supply or facilities for
firefighting purposes, as determined by the Fire Chief, are furnished.

   In addition to the fees prescribed in §
1424.11, the City Engineer shall, before issuing any permit for construction
involving excavation, grading, filling or the hauling of earth to or from the

   (a)   The Director of City Services shall cause to be removed all earth,
debris or building material which may be placed, left or permitted to remain on
any pavement, sidewalk or tree lawn in the course of the work for which such
permit is granted, unless the applicant promptly causes such earth, debris or
material to be removed.
   (b)   The Director of City Services shall report to the Director of Finance
the cost of such removal, which cost shall be charged against the applicant.
Such cost, so far as met by the deposit, shall be paid into the treasury for
the use of the Service Fund. The deposit, or such balance thereof as may remain

§ 1426.02 DEPOSIT FOR DAMAGE TO PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   Before any person is granted a permit for the construction,
enlargement, alteration, repair or removal of any dwelling, building or other
structure, which work may result in damage to a city street, highway, sidewalk,
tree lawn, gutter or utility, he or she shall be required to deposit with the
Director of Finance the sum of $500 for each such permit, as security that any
such damage which may be caused will be repaired in a manner satisfactory to
the city. The deposit shall be retained by the Director of Finance in a special
fund for the purposes outlined herein until such time as the City Engineer
certifies that all damage to the aforesaid property has been satisfactorily
repaired or replaced. Upon such certification by the City Engineer, the deposit
shall be returned to the person making the deposit, less a fee of $100 to cover
inspection of the work.
   (b)   In the event that the person making the deposit fails to repair any of
the damage, the city shall make arrangements for such necessary repairs or
replacements and deduct the cost thereof from the deposit. If the deposit is
insufficient to reimburse the city, the Director of Finance shall take the
necessary steps to effect the collection of the remainder of the cost from the
person making the deposit. If the deposit exceeds the cost of such repairs or
replacements, the Director of Finance shall issue a check to return the excess
to the person who made such deposit.

made a like deposit with the city for making a tap or connection to any water
main, sewer or drain or for the repair thereof.

   The City Engineer shall establish the grade for any proposed building. The
finished grade at the building shall not be less than a 2% gradient above the
crown of the road, as measured from the edge of the dedicated portion of the
road, except that in any particular case where the applicant can show that, by
reason of exceptional topographical or other physical conditions, the
establishment of a 2% gradient would cause practical difficulties or undue
hardship, the City Engineer may allow the establishment of a different grade
which is just and proper, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship. Before
proceeding beyond the foundation for such building, the applicant shall request
further inspection by the City Engineer, who shall determine whether such
foundation has been constructed in accordance with the established grade. At
the direction of the City Engineer, the Chief Building Official shall not
permit the continuance of construction beyond the foundation for any building
if he or she finds that the foundation has not been constructed in accordance
with the established grade.

   (a)   Before any person is granted permission to make changes in the contour
of any land proposed to be subdivided, developed or changed in use by grading
or excavating or by the removal or destruction of the natural topsoil, trees or
other vegetative covering thereon, he or she shall be required to, at the
option of the City Engineer, either provide a performance bond, in a form
satisfactory to the Director of Law, or deposit with the Director of Finance
the sum of $5 per linear foot of roadway, as security that he or she shall
undertake the immediate reseeding of disturbed ground with quick-growing
vegetation to provide erosion control and prevent siltation in accordance with
the conditions of approval of the City Engineer pursuant to §
1254.01 of these Codified Ordinances. The performance bond or deposit shall be
retained by the Director of Finance until such time as the City Engineer
certifies that there has been satisfactory reseeding of disturbed ground with
quick-growing vegetation to provide erosion control and to prevent siltation.
Upon such certification by the City Engineer, the performance bond or deposit
shall be returned to the person providing the same, less a fee to cover
inspection of the work.
   (b)   In the event that the person submitting the bond fails to reseed the
disturbed ground, the city shall take any and all actions necessary to enforce
the performance insured by the surety. In the event that the person making the
deposit fails to reseed the disturbed ground, the city shall make arrangements
for the necessary reseeding and deduct the cost thereof from the deposit. If
the deposit is insufficient to reimburse the city, the Director of Finance
shall take the necessary steps to effect the collection of the remainder of the
cost from the person making the deposit. If the deposit exceeds the cost of
such reseeding, the Director of Finance shall issue a check to return the
excess to the person who made the deposit.

§ 1448.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   (a)   CHIMNEY. A vertical shaft of masonry (brick or stone exterior) or
metal, noncombustible, heat-resisting material approved by the Building
Department and approved and tested by Underwriters’ Laboratories, Inc. for the
use intended, which encloses one or more flues for the purpose of removing
products of combustion from solid, liquid or gas fuel.
   (b)   DRAFT HOOD. A device placed in and made a part of the flue pipe from
an appliance, or a part of an appliance itself, which is to be designed to
assure the ready escape of all the products of combustion in the event of no
draft, backdraft and stoppage beyond the draft hood, or to prevent a backdraft
from entering the appliance, and to neutralize the effects of stack action of
the chimney flue upon the operation of the appliance.
   (c)   FLUE. A vertical passageway for products of combustion.
   (d)   HOOD. As applied to a heating device, means a canopy or a similar
device placed over a stove, range or other heating installation connected to a
venting duct.
   (e)   SMOKEPIPE. A pipe or breeching connecting a heating apparatus and a
flue.
(Ord. 1963-52, passed 5-6-1963)
§ 1448.02 FURNACE AND BOILER ROOMS.
   (a)   Every furnace installed in any building, other than a one-family
dwelling, shall be enclosed and separated from the rest of the building by
walls, partitions, floors and ceilings of noncombustible construction or of
one-hour fire-resistance construction. Buildings having a capacity, for their
particular use, of more than 75 persons or of assembly occupancy, shall have
their furnace(s) separated from the rest of the building by wall, partition,
floor and ceiling construction having a fire-resistance rating of not less than
two hours, or as required below. In no case shall the enclosing construction be
located within two and one-half feet of the furnace on the rear and sides, and
four feet in the front.
   (b)   The surfaces of combustible materials less than 30 inches above a
furnace shall be covered with not less than No. 24 U.S. gauge sheet metal,
whose edges shall be extended not less than 12 inches beyond the top of the
heating unit.
   (c)   Every boiler carrying more than 15 pounds per square inch pressure,
with a rating in excess of ten boiler horsepower, shall be installed in a
separate room or compartment and separated from the rest of the building by
walls and partitions having at least a two-hour fire-resistance rating and by
floor and ceiling construction having not less than a two and one-half hour
fire rating.
(Ord. 1963-52, passed 5-6-1963)
§ 1448.03 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   All chimneys, stacks, heating equipment and other apparatus liable to
cause undue heating to surrounding materials or parts of any building shall be
well and carefully constructed and maintained at all times in a safe condition.
When operated under the most severe service conditions, they shall not cause
any combustible material adjacent to them to attain a higher temperature than
125°F. Whenever any such apparatus is found to be defective or in such a
condition as is liable to cause a fire, the Chief Building Official or Fire
Chief shall order the same repaired at once or, in case the same is not
repaired within a reasonable length of time, he or she may order it removed at
the owner’s expense. This authority shall extend to such apparatus existing
before the adoption of this chapter as well as to that constructed subsequent
to its adoption. Any rebuilding shall be done in accordance with all the
requirements of this chapter.
   (b)   Chimneys and flues shall be required for all dwellings and all heating
or heat-producing appliances. No flue shall have a smokepipe connection in more
than one story of a building. The smokepipe of a heating appliance shall not be
connected into the flue of an incinerator which has a rubbish chute identical
to the smoke flue. All smokepipe or vent outlets shall be provided with metal
or tile thimbles, carefully fitted into the linings of the flue, causing no
restrictions to the size of the same, and all such inlets shall be proportioned
in accordance with the size of the smokepipe or vent which they receive, so as
to prevent the escape of smoke, gas or sparks, and shall rigidly hold the pipe
or vent in place. When eight by 12-inch flue liners are used, the smokepipe
shall enter the flue on the 12-inch side or the flue will be made larger for a
distance of two feet above the smokepipe to permit the smokepipe to enter
without flattening, except when the smokepipe is not as wide as the flue.
(Ord. 1977-31, passed over veto 4-18-1977)
   (c)   (1)   For each furnace the minimum net area of any flue shall be 64
square inches for square or rectangular flues, and 55 square inches for any
round or oval flue. The flue area of any heating apparatus, other than domestic
stoves, shall be adequate to carry off combustive products without attaining a
stack temperature in excess of 650°F in the outgoing gases. Minimum effective
flue area shall not be less than the following:
 
Fireplaces (not less than 1/10 the fireplace opening) 96 square inches
Stoves, ranges and small room heaters                 40 square inches
Warm air furnaces, steam and hot water boilers        64 square inches
 
      (2)   These sizes are applicable only with connection to a flue. Such
minimum effective flue areas shall be provided by a flue liner with the short
dimension not less than one-half of the long dimension. When more than two
flues are connected or contained in the same chimney, each unit of the two
flues shall be separated from any other flues by masonry not less than three
and three-quarter inches bonded to the wall of the chimney.
      (3)   The joining of two or more smokepipes to a single flue connection
will be permitted, provided that the smokepipe and flue are of sufficient size
to serve all of the appliances thus connected and provided that, except for
vents for gas appliances, the several smokepipes are constructed to comply with
the severest requirements for any one of those connected. All smokepipes shall
be as short and straight as possible. No smokepipes shall pass through any
floor or ceiling. Where a smokepipe must pass through a partition, it must be
provided with a double metal ventilated thimble not less than three diameters
of original pipe. Smokepipes shall not come within 20 inches of any unprotected
combustible material, whether plastered or not.
   (d)   No chimney shall carry any load other than its own weight. Steel or
other incombustible structural members shall not be supported by the required
thickness of chimney wall, but may be supported by an adequate masonry buttress
constructed integrally with the chimney. All chimney foundations shall be of
solid brick masonry or reinforced 2,500 pound concrete, extending at least
three feet below the grade line and at least one and one-half feet into virgin
soil. Such a foundation shall distribute the weight of the chimney uniformly so
as not to exceed one-half of the soil-bearing capacity beneath same, and shall
be so constructed and proportioned to carry the entire chimney structure
without settling and cracking. All chimneys shall be securely stayed against
wind pressures and shall be designed to resist a horizontal wind load of 25
pounds per square foot for heights up to 100 feet. In no case shall the
overturning moment due to wind stress exceed two-thirds of the moment of
stability due to dead load only. The calculation method shall be made to the
acceptability of the Building Department.
   (e)   No chimney shall be allowed to corbel more than six inches in any
direction. Such corbelling shall be accomplished with a maximum of one-inch
projection for each course of brick. No chimney shall be corbelled from a wall
which is less than 12 inches in thickness unless it projects equally on each of
its sides or provides that in the second story of a two-story dwelling the
corbelling on the exterior of the enclosing walls may equal the wall thickness.
   (f)   When chimneys occur in masonry walls, they shall be bonded to the wall
every fifth course of brick or 16 inches height of wall. No change may take
place in size and shape of a chimney, where it passes through the roof, when
made within six inches below or above the roof joists, rafters, trusses and the
like.
   (g)   An opening shall be provided at the base of each flue of all stacks
and chimneys for cleanout purposes, and each such opening shall be provided
with a cast-iron or better cleanout door and frame. When ash pits are used
under fireplaces, each and every fireplace shall be provided with its own
separate ash pit, equipped with a cast-iron door and frame on its cleanout
opening. The doors and frames are to be arranged to remain tightly closed when
not in use.
   (h)   All incinerators, stacks and any chimney smokestack or flue which
emits sparks or sized to cause a hazard to buildings and surrounding property
shall be equipped with a spark arrester of proper size and construction to
prevent the emission of dangerous sparks. The sides of the spark arrester (or
circumference) shall be equal to at least the smallest dimension of the chimney
flue. The total area of the spark arrester shall not be less than four times
the area of the flue. If a square flue is used, the vertical side of the spark
arrester shall not be less than the smallest flue dimension. If a circular flue
is used, the vertical side of the spark arrester shall not be less than the
flue diameter. The maximum size of mesh shall be one-half inch.
   (i)   (1)   Whenever a building is hereafter erected, enlarged or raised,
the owner of such building shall, at his or her own expense, carry up, either
independently or on his or her own building, all chimneys and smoke flues of an
adjoining building which are within ten feet of any portion of the wall
extending above such chimney or flue. The construction of such chimneys and
flues shall conform to all the requirements of this Building Code. Such
chimneys and flues shall be carried simultaneously with the walls.
      (2)   It shall be the duty of the owner of the building to be erected,
enlarged or raised, to notify in writing, at least ten days before such work is
to begin, the owner of the chimneys and flues affected of his or her intention
to carry up such chimneys and flues.
   (j)   The Building Department and its representatives may order that a test
be made on any chimney for smoke leaks at the owner’s expense, if, in the
judgment of the Building Department, it is necessary.
(Ord. 1963-52, passed 5-6-1963)
§ 1448.04 CHIMNEY CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS.
   (a)   Chimneys with a smoke flue having no side or diameter in excess of 24
inches shall be built of eight inches of brick, solid masonry or stone. If
provided with a standard terra cotta flue of not less than five-eighths of an
inch in thickness, the walls may be only four inches in thickness.
   (b)   Chimneys having any side or diameter more than 24 inches, but not
having an area in excess of 900 square inches, shall be lined with a firebrick
lining four inches minimum thickness laid in fireproof mortar, for a distance
of not less than two feet below the lowest smoke inlet and extending upward at
least 20 feet. The remainder of the chimney shall have the same lining or may
have a standard terra cotta flue lining. Such firebrick may be considered as a
part of the thickness required for the surrounding walls, except in cases where
there is an air space between such lining and surrounding walls. In such cases
the surrounding walls shall be the full thickness required. In no case shall
they be less than eight inches in thickness.
   (c)   All chimneys with a flue area greater than 900 square inches, and
other chimneys subject to excessive heat, shall be lined with firebrick at
least four inches thick and extending from below the flue opening to a height
of one-fifth the chimney height for steam boilers, or to one-half the chimney
exposed to temperatures of 800 to 1,200°F and for the full height for
temperatures over 1,200°F. At least a two-inch air space shall be allowed in
all cases between lining and the outer wall. The lining material shall not be
considered as carrying any stress. This requirement also applies to smoke flues
of high pressure (over 15 pounds pressure) appliances.
   (d)   Chimneys shall be finished on top with one of the following:
      (1)   A three-inch stone cap;
      (2)   A solid masonry laid up in cement lime mortar;
      (3)   A solid three-inch minimum concrete cap; and
      (4)   Cast-iron plates at least three-fourths of an inch thick.
   (e)   All chimneys shall be built at least four feet above flat roofs, or a
minimum of two feet above the peaks of pitched roofs, and chimneys for iron
cupolas and other similar purposes shall project at least 15 feet above the
highest point of any roof within 50 feet.

hundred-fortieth of the diameter of the stack, and stacks over 50 feet high
shall not be made of metal less than three-sixteenths of an inch thick.
   (j)   All metal stacks shall be at least ten feet higher than the highest
point of buildings or roofs of buildings within a radius of 50 feet.
   (k)   Lengthening or alterations may be required by the Building Department
of any chimney, stack or flue which may cause a nuisance or be a fire hazard to
surrounding property, regardless of the 50-foot requirement above, unless the
nuisance or fire hazard can be abated in some other way.
   (l)   The exposed length of any metal stack above the ground or roof shall
be inspected at least every two years by a competent steeplejack, employed by
the owner or user of such stack, who shall furnish the Building Department with
a certificate as to the condition of such stack and its support. Such
certificate shall be accepted only from steeplejacks who are registered with
the Department after it is determined that they are competent.
   (m)   All stacks shall be kept in good condition and the exposed portion
shall be kept well painted.
(Ord. 1963-52, passed 5-6-1963)

   (a)   All fireplaces designed to burn solid fuel shall be constructed of
masonry supported from the ground or upon fireproof construction. The back and
sides of such fireplaces shall be at least six and one-half inches thick up to
the point where flue lining commences, above which the construction shall
comply with all requirements for masonry chimneys. Every such fireplace shall
have a separate and distinct flue having a net area of not less than 45 square
inches. No wood or other combustible material shall be permitted to enter the
required thickness of masonry around the fireplace or flue. A permit shall be
required and a fee paid in accordance with §
1424.11 before the construction of any fireplace may commence.
   (b)   The joint between the face brick or tile used for the mantel facing
shall be slushed solid with mortar.
   (c)   The hearth shall be at least 20 inches wide measured from the outer
face of the masonry and shall extend at least 16 inches on each side of the
fireplace opening. The hearth shall be of brick or concrete at least four
inches thick supported on brick arches, reinforced concrete or steel joists, or
on steel bars not over eight inches apart. One end of the hearth supports shall
rest on the fireplace supports.
   (d)   Every fireplace using heating appliances, for which natural or
artificial gas is used as fuel, shall be provided with a suitable vent flue
having a net area of not less than 12 square inches, and having all joints
properly sealed.
   (e)   Flues will not be required when approved gas heating appliances are
used for space heaters which meet the following requirements. A space heater
shall produce no carbon monoxide. This requirement shall be deemed met when:
      (1)   A concentration not in excess of 0.02% is present in an air-free
sample of combustion products when tested in a room with approximately a normal
oxygen supply; and
      (2)   When the heater is operated in a reduced oxygen supply, a
concentration not in excess of 0.05% is produced in a 1,000 cubic foot airtight
room with no air changes occurring during the combustion of an amount of gas
liberating 20,000 B.T.U.
(Ord. 1963-52, passed 5-6-1963)
   (f)   Notwithstanding any applicable sections of this chapter to the
contrary, the installation of free-standing fireplaces with metal chimneys,

§ 1462.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory authorization. Article XVIII, § 3, of the Ohio Constitution
grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and control
measures for promoting the health, safety and general welfare of its citizens.
Therefore, the City Council does ordain the following regulations.
   (b)   Findings of fact. The city has special flood hazard areas that are
subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute
to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages and to
achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the flood
hazard area are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the flood hazard area;
      (11)   Prevent flood hazard area uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of reducing flood loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood hazard areas, stream
channels and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to which these regulations apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city as
identified in division (f) hereof, including any additional areas of special
flood hazard annexed by the city.
   (f)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective December 3, 2010;
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
flood hazard area, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood
hazard; and
      (3)   A.   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by
a registered professional engineer in the state which has been approved by the
city as required by §
1462.04(c); and
         B.   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations.
Such maps and/or studies are on file at the City Hall at 34200 Bainbridge Road,
Solon, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by human-made
or natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas
of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these
regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   ZONE C AND ZONE X (UNSHADED). Areas determined to be outside the
500-year flood hazard area.
   (o)   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes
shown on flood boundary and floodway maps), and the water surface elevations of
the base flood.
   (p)   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE). The base flood elevation plus two
feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the Flood
Hazard Area Administrator.
   (q)   FLOODWAY.
      (1)   The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
FLOODWAY is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
      (2)   The FLOODWAY is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of flood hazard area management. FREEBOARD tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the United States Department of Interior) or
preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the
requirements for individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the state’s inventory of historic places
maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the state, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary
and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program flood hazard area management criteria. A CLOMR
does not amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary
and floodway maps, or flood insurance studies.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to human-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, flood hazard area and floodway delineations, and planimetric
features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning
whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood
elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
   (v)   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an ENCLOSURE BELOW THE
LOWEST FLOOR which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle. For the purposes of
these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile
homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in the O.A.C. 3701-27-01, means
any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for
habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). A federal program enabling
property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection
against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide an
insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
flood hazard area management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Solon Flood
Insurance Rate Map, February 4, 1981, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   (aa)   PERSON. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An AGENCY is further defined in R.C. § 111.15 as any
governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district or state community college. AGENCY does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s department or any
court.
   (bb)   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   (cc)   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT. A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of R.C. §§ 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (dd)   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person registered as a
professional engineer under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA also known as AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD
HAZARD. The land in the flood hazard area subject to a 1% or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood
insurance studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary
maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30 and A99. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS may also
refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal, state or
local sources of data including, but not limited to, historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred. SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE also means flood related damage sustained
by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the
cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or
exceeds 25% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
      (1)   Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement
of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of
the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. When the
combined total of all previous improvements or repairs made during the life of
the structure equals or exceeds 50% of a structure’s market value, that
structure is considered a SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. This term includes
structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual
repair work performed.
      (2)   The term does not, however, include:
         A.   Any improvement to a structure that is considered new
construction;
         B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
         C.   Any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (kk)   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

   (j)   Map maintenance activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that city flood maps, studies and other data identified in §
1462.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate flood hazard
area management criteria are based on current data, the following map
maintenance activities are identified.
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with §
1462.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with division (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
            1.   A LOMR shall be required for any changes to the FEMA flood
data prior to the issuance of the flood hazard area development permit.
         C.   The Flood Hazard Area Administrator shall require a conditional
letter of map revision prior to the issuance of a flood hazard area development
permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation;
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway; and
            3.   Decrease in BFE.
         D.   Flood hazard area development permits issued by the Flood Hazard
Area Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter
of map revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to division (j)
(1)A. hereof.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Flood Hazard Area
Administrator may request changes to any of the information shown on an
effective map that does not impact flood hazard area or floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a
submission shall include appropriate supporting documentation made in writing
by the Mayor, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Flood Hazard Area
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the city
have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce flood hazard area
management regulations for a particular area. In order that the city flood
insurance rate map accurately represent the city boundaries, include within
such notification a copy of a map of the city suitable for reproduction,
clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the city has
assumed or relinquished flood hazard area management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data use and flood map interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard.
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Flood Hazard Area Administrator
shall review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from
a federal, state or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Flood Hazard Area
Administrator.
      (3)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps and/or flood insurance
study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations; and
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Flood Hazard Area Administrator shall make interpretations,
where needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of
special flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of
the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in §
1462.05.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks and the like) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial damage determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire and the like. After such a damage event,
the Flood Hazard Area Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make a reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially
damaged structures of the need to obtain a flood hazard area development permit
prior to repair, rehabilitation or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Flood Hazard Area Administrator may implement
other measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and
subsequent repair process. These measures include issuing press releases,
public service announcements, and other public information materials related to
the flood hazard area development permits and repair of damaged structures;
coordinating with other federal, state and local agencies to assist with
substantial damage determinations; providing owners of damaged structures
materials and other information related to the proper repair of damaged
structures in special flood hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially
damaged structures with increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

   (i)   Assurance of flood carrying capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized.
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a flood hazard area development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic
and hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
1462.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor and the Chief Executive Officer of
any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a flood hazard
area development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible; and
            2.   Division (i)(1)B.1. and (i)(1)B.3. through (i)(1)B.5. hereof.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the bankfull stage.
The field determination of bankfull stage shall be based on methods presented
in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-245, Stream
Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or other
applicable publications available from a federal, state or other authoritative
source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse, the following
standards apply.
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
flood hazard area development permit, the applicant must submit a description
of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result
of the proposed development, and certification by a registered professional
engineer that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not
be diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the United States Army Corps of Engineers
and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be
notified prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of
such notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Flood Hazard Area
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
city specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the flood hazard area development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in §
1462.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
      (4)   Compensatory storage required for fill. Fill within the area of
special flood hazard shall result in a no net loss of natural flood hazard area
storage. The volume of the loss of floodwater storage due to filling in the
special flood hazard area shall be offset by providing an equal volume of flood
storage by excavation or other compensatory measures at or adjacent to the
development site.
   (j)   Fill. The following standards apply to all fill activities in special
flood hazard areas.
      (1)   Fill sites, upon which structures will be constructed or placed,
must be compacted to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with the Standard
Proctor Test method or an acceptable equivalent method.
      (2)   Fill slopes shall not be steeper than one foot vertical to two feet
horizontal.
      (3)   Adequate protection against erosion and scour is provided for fill
slopes. When expected velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of
five feet per second armoring with stone or rock protection shall be provided.
When expected velocities during the base flood are five feet per second or less
protection shall be provided by covering them with vegetative cover.
      (4)   Fill shall be composed of clean granular or earthen material.

§ 1462.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board established.
      (1)   The City of Solon Planning Commission is hereby appointed to serve
as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by City Code.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in City Hall
at 34200 Bainbridge Road, Solon, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Flood Hazard Area Administrator in the administration or enforcement of
these regulations; and
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with division (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Flood Hazard Area Administrator may request and shall be granted
a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person
shall file, within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or other
official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the
mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Flood Hazard Area
Administrator’s decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Flood Hazard Area Administrator. Upon receipt
of the appeal, the Flood Hazard Area Administrator shall transmit said notice
and all pertinent information on which the Flood Hazard Area Administrator’s
decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the Flood
Hazard Area Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it
to the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: name, address and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the flood hazard area; description
of the variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the city.
      (2)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood hazard area management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   A.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant;
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws;
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages; and
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         B.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in division (d)(2)A. to (d)(2)K.
hereof have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeals. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals Board may
appeal such decision to City Council in accordance with Chapter 1293 of the
Codified Ordinance. If the appeal is denied, variance is modified, or variance
is denied by City Council, the aggrieved may appeal such decision to the
Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, as provided in R.C. Chapter 2506.
(Ord. 2010-195, passed 9-20-2010)
§ 1462.06 ENFORCEMENT.

copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a first degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined $1,000 or
imprisoned as provided by the laws of the city. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation. The city shall prosecute any violation of
these regulations in accordance with the penalties stated herein.

discharge to the MS4 is prohibited except as described below:
            1.   Water line flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream
flows; rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration;
uncontaminated pumped ground water; discharges from potable water sources;
foundation drains; air conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs;
water from crawl space pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual
residential, non- commercial, or charity car washing; flows from riparian
habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated/debrominated/desalinated swimming pool
discharges; street wash water; dye tests; and discharges or flows from
firefighting activities. These discharges are exempt until such time as they
are determined by the city to be significant contributors of pollutants to the
MS4;
            2.   Discharges specified in writing by the city as being necessary
to protect public health and safety; and
            3.   Discharges from off-lot discharging home sewage treatment
systems permitted by the Cuyahoga County Board of Health for the purpose of
discharging treated sewage effluent in accordance with O.A.C. 3701-29, or other
applicable Cuyahoga County Board of Health regulations, until such time as the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency issues an NPDES permitting mechanism for
residential one-, two- or three-family dwellings. These discharges are exempt
unless such discharges are deemed to be creating a public health nuisance by
the Cuyahoga County Board of Health.
         B.   In compliance with the city’s Stormwater Management Program,
discharges from all off-lot discharging home sewage treatment systems must
either be eliminated or have coverage under an appropriate NPDES permit issued
and approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. When such permit
coverage is available, discharges from off-lot discharging home sewage
treatment systems will no longer be exempt from the requirements of this
regulation.
      (2)   Prohibition of illegal connections. The construction, use,
maintenance or continued existence of illegal connections to the MS4 is
prohibited.
         A.   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illegal
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection, except for basement floor drains originally constructed and
connected to the MS4 and in full compliance with city regulations in place at
the time of connection. Such connections shall be exempt from this regulation
until such time as the city determines they are a significant source of illicit
discharges to the MS4.
         B.   A person is considered to be in violation of this regulation if
the person connects a line conveying illicit discharges to the MS4, or allows
such a connection to continue.
      (3)   Prohibition of stormwater inflow. No person shall discharge, or
cause to be discharged, stormwater into the POTW. The commencement, conduct or
continuance of any stormwater discharge to the POTW is prohibited.
      (4)   Prohibition of the discharge of woody debris, lawn clippings,
floatable materials and other similar materials. No person shall discharge, or
cause to be discharged, woody debris lawn clippings, floatable materials or
similar materials into the MS4 or below the ordinary high water mark of a
watercourse within the city.
   (h)   Monitoring of illicit discharges, stormwater inflow and illegal
connections.
      (1)   Establishment of an illicit discharge, stormwater inflow and
illegal connection monitoring program. The city shall establish a program to
detect and eliminate illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4 and
stormwater inflow to the POTW. This program shall include the mapping of the
MS4, including MS4 outfalls and home sewage treatment systems; the routine
inspection of stormwater outfalls to the MS4, and the systematic investigation
of potential residential, commercial, industrial and institutional facilities
for the sources of any dry weather flows found as the result of these
inspections.
      (2)   Inspection of residential, commercial, industrial or institutional
facilities.
         A.   The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to this regulation as often as may be necessary to determine compliance
with this regulation. The city shall give 24 hours notice before said
inspection.
         B.   The city shall have the right to set up at facilities subject to
this regulation such devices as are necessary to conduct monitoring and/or
sampling of the facility’s stormwater discharge, as determined by the city.
         C.   The city shall have the right to require the facility owner/
operator to install monitoring equipment as necessary. This sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in safe and proper
operating condition by the facility owner/operator at the owner/operator’s
expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be
calibrated by the city to ensure their accuracy.
         D.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and reasonable
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed
by the facility’s owner/operator at the written or oral request of the city and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
facility owner/operator.
         E.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a facility
subject to this regulation for the purposes of illicit discharge inspection is
a violation of this regulation.
         F.   If the city is refused access to any part of the facility from
which stormwater is discharged, and the city demonstrates probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this regulation, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of an inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this regulation or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the public health, safety and welfare, the city may
seek issuance of a search warrant, civil remedies including but not limited to
injunctive relief, and/or criminal remedies from any court of appropriate
jurisdiction.
         G.   Any costs associated with these inspections shall be assessed to
the facility owner/operator.
   (i)   Enforcement.
      (1)   Notice of violation. When the city finds that a person has violated
a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this regulation, the city may
order compliance by written notice of violation. Such notice must specify the
violation and shall be hand-delivered, and/or sent by mail, to the owner/
operator of the facility. Such notice may require the following actions:
         A.   The performance of monitoring, analyses and reporting;
         B.   The elimination of illicit discharges, stormwater inflow or
illegal connections;
         C.   That violating discharges, inflow practices or operations cease
and desist;
         D.   The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; or
         E.   The implementation of source control or treatment best management
practices (BMPs).
      (2)   Abatement. If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of
affected property is required, the notice of violation shall set forth a
deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said
notice shall further advise that, should the facility owner/operator fail to
remediate or restore within the established deadline, a legal action for
enforcement may be initiated.
      (3)   Compliance standards. Any person receiving a notice of violation
must meet compliance standards within the time established in the notice of
violation.
      (4)   Administrative hearing. If the violation has not been corrected
pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation, the city
shall schedule an administrative hearing before the Mayor or the Mayor’s
designee to determine reasons for noncompliance and to determine the next
enforcement activity. Notice of the administrative hearing shall be hand
delivered and/or sent by mail. A decision shall be issued within ten days of
such administrative hearing. An appeal to such decision must be filed with City
Council within 14 days of said decision, otherwise said decision will be final.
City Council shall affirm, reverse or modify said decision in its next three
regularly scheduled meetings.
      (5)   Injunctive relief. It shall be unlawful for any owner/operator to
violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this
regulation pursuant to R.C. § 3709.211. If an owner/operator has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this regulation, the city may petition
for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the owner/operator from
activities that would create further violations or compelling the owner/
operator to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
   (j)   Remedies not exclusive. The remedies listed in this regulation are not
exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state
or local law and it is in the discretion of the city to seek cumulative
remedies.
