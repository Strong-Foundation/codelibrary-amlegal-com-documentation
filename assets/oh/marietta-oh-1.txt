EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR’S NOTE: Source material for the Codified Ordinances of Marietta was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Marietta Codified Ordinances is indicated. (For Ordinances or Resolutions
passed prior to 2-20-86 please consult the printed Codified Ordinances Book.)

on the last day of that month.
(ORC 1.45)
      (3)   A.   The time within which an act is required by law to be done
shall be computed by excluding the first and including the last day; except
that when the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be
done on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
         B.   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may
be performed on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal

   101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
   101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
   101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
   101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
(1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United States
is intended;
(2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
(3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
(4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
(1)   The object sought to be attained;
(2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
(3)   The legislative history;
(4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws upon the
same or similar subjects;
(5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
(6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.09 AMENDMENTS TO CODIFIED ORDINANCES.
   All ordinances passed subsequent to these Codified Ordinances which amend,
repeal or in any way affect these Codified Ordinances shall be numbered in
accordance with the numbering system of these Codified Ordinances and printed
for inclusion herein, or in case of the repeal of chapters, sections,
subsections or any part thereof by subsequent ordinances, such repealed

and future legislation.
   The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from 2:00 a.m.
of the last Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in October.
Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring uniform
observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in 1967,
except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from Daylight
Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with a
different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.

   133.01  CHIEF DEPUTY AUDITOR.
   (a)   There is hereby created the position of Chief Deputy Auditor, to be
appointed by the City Auditor.
   (b)   The duties and responsibilities of the Chief Deputy Auditor shall be
to perform the duties of the City Auditor as set forth in the Ohio Revised Code
during the absence or inability of the Auditor to so act.
(Ord. 157 (72-73). Passed 12-29-73.)
   133.02 COSTS FOR COPIES OF PUBLIC RECORDS.
   There is hereby established a charge of five cents ($.05) per page for the
cost of copying public records to be made available to the public by the City
of Marietta, Ohio, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 149.43.
(Ord. 332 (00-01). Passed 12-20-01.)
   133.03  CREDIT/PURCHASING CARD POLICY.
   (a)   Credit cards are purchasing tools, which offer an alternative to the
existing City of Marietta purchasing process. They provide an extremely
efficient and effective method of purchasing and paying for goods and services.
   (b)   All City credit cards shall be issued in the name of the "City of
Marietta" and may also include the name of the custodian. The authorized
Cardholder that handles a credit card is responsible for the appropriate use of
City funds. The credit card is the property of the City of Marietta and may be
rescinded at any time. The credit card is only to be used for the types of
purchase outlined in this policy.
   (c)   Each "Custodian" (as defined herein) shall keep a current record of
transactions and receipts to protect himself/herself and the City. These
records are important internal control elements of the electronic purchasing
process and essential to the success of the credit card program.
   (d)   Authorized Cardholders under this policy are the Auditor (credit limit
$5,000.00), Judge (credit limit $2,500.00), and Health Dept. Fiscal Clerk
(credit limit $2,500.00). The credit card issued to the Auditor shall be for
the use of all City departments for which individual cards have not been issued
and shall be kept by the Auditor who shall serve as the "Custodian" (as defined
herein) of that credit card.
   (e)   Procedure.
      (1)   Credit cards simplify the purchasing and disbursement process by
facilitating point-of-demand procurement. Purchasing authority is delegated to
the authorized Cardholder enabling him or her to place an order directly with
the supplier.
         When the supplier requests a purchase authorization, the Credit Card
system validates the transaction against pre-set limits established by the
City.
      (2)   All transactions are approved or declined (instantaneously) based
on the following credit card authorization criteria:
         A.   Number of transactions allowed per day
         B.   Number of transactions allowed per month
         C.   Single purchase limit
         D.   Spending limit per month
         E.   Approved merchant commodity code
      (3)   The authorization process occurs through an electronic system that
supports the credit card processing services under the City of Marietta
agreement with the card provider. In addition, the Auditor, Judge and Fiscal
Clerk will have the capability to view transactions daily and create reports to
effectively monitor he use of the credit cards.
   (f)   Purchasing Guidelines.
      (1)   The credit card program will not circumvent the City's purchasing
rules and procedures. The Credit cards will not be used in place of a Purchase
Order. As such, regular purchase order policy and procedures must be followed
for all credit card purchases.
      (2)   The card Custodian is responsible for the security of the card he/
she is issued and for the purchases made with it. Consequences for card misuse
are severe and penalties may include loss of job.
      (3)   The regulations for the usage of credit cards are as follows:
         A.   It is the responsibility of each Custodian to have control over
all purchases made by each authorized employee using the credit card.
         B.   The authorized employee must submit all requests for credit card
deletions, additions, or changes in writing to the Auditor, Judge or Fiscal
Clerk.
         C.   The authorized employee using the credit card is the person that
is responsible for tracking and reporting monthly purchases to the Auditor's
Office.
   (g)   Restrictions on Credit Card Use.
      (1)   Credit cards cannot be used for the following: cash advances,
traveler's checks, personal services, capital equipment (equipment purchases
exceeding $5,000.00), purchases of alcoholic beverages, tobacco purchases, and
any other purchase that is not for a public purpose of the City of Marietta.
      (2)   Credit cards cannot be used for the following transaction types
listed below unless the Auditor bas specifically approved the inclusion as an
approved merchant commodity code on a specific credit card: airline tickets,
automobiles and vehicle rentals, registration fees for educational programs
( conferences, seminars, forums, and continuing education), and hotels.
   (h)   Placing an Order.  When placing an order, the Cardholder should be
able to provide the vendor the following credit card information:
      (1)   Identify himself/herself as a City of Marietta employee
      (2)   Indicate that the purchase will be made using a credit card
      (3)   Supply the provider card name
      (4)   Provide the individual card number
      (5)   Give the expiration date of the card
      (6)   Provide the complete delivery address
      (7)   Any other information necessary to make the purchase
      (8)   Never allow a vendor to maintain the credit card information for
its files
   (i)   Order Verification Procedures.
      (1)   Upon receipt of an order, the documentation received from the
vendor (typically a sales receipt or packing slip) shall be kept for later
reconciliation. Each month the card Custodian will receive a statement from the
card provider showing all purchases made. It is the responsibility of the card
Custodian to verify each purchase.
      (2)   The card Custodian is responsible for ensuring receipt of goods and
services. Items should be returned directly to the vendor by whichever means
the vendor requires. The card Custodian is responsible for seeing that the
proper credit is posted for any returned items.
   (j)   Proof of Purchase Documentation and Reconciliation.
      (1)   With the authority to purchase specific goods and services comes
the responsibility to maintain adequate documentation at the source of the
transaction. Whenever a packing slip or sales receipt is received by the
authorized employee making the purchase, the sales receipt should be forwarded
to the Custodian of the card as proof that the transaction occurred. The
Custodian should retain this documentation until the monthly statement from the
card provider is received. Any transaction without a properly substantiated
receipt is subject to reimbursement of the City by the authorized employee that
made the purchase.
      (2)   After receiving the statement from the card provider, the card
Custodian will need to verify all purchases made. The original documentation
along with the correlating purchase order will be sent by the authorized
employee to the Auditor's Office for processing.
      (3)   All documentation must support the legitimate business purpose of
all transaction made with the credit card. In addition to sales receipts and
packing slips, the following are examples of supporting documentation: copies
of order forms or applications, services reports when service is provided by a
vendor, and cash register receipts.
   (k)   Discrepancies and Dispute Procedures.  
      (1)   The authorized employee that makes the purchase is responsible for
following up with a vendor for any erroneous charges, disputed items, or
returns. Disputed charges can result from failure to receive goods or services,
fraud or misuse, altered charges, defective merchandise, incorrect amounts,
duplicate charges, credits not processed, etc. The authorized employee who made
the purchase should contact the vendor first to resolve any outstanding issues.
      (2)   In the event that the authorized employee who made the purchase is
unsuccessful with resolving disputes with the vendor, he/she will need to
notify the card Custodian to obtain help in resolving the issue. The card
Custodian will then need to contact the card provider to report the dispute.
The card provider will decide what form the card Custodian will need to file in
order to resolve the dispute. Any contact made with a vendor, as well as its
response, should be attached to the bill, especially noting the date that the
exchange of information occurred.
      (3)   Please Note: By law, vendors are not permitted to bill a credit
card for purchases until the items have been shipped.
   (l)   Custodian Purchasing Log.
      (1)   The Auditor's Office, Judge and Fiscal Clerk shall use the
"Purchasing Log" to record transactions and help reconcile to the monthly
statement.
      (2)   The information to be included on the purchasing log is as follows:
the transaction date, vendor, authorized employee signing out the credit card
and date returned (same day).
   (m)   Payment.  The City of Marietta is responsible for payment of
authorized and appropriate credit card transactions. The credit card will not
affect the Cardholder's personal credit in any way.
   (n)   Lost or Stolen Cards.
      (1)   In the event that the credit card is lost or stolen, it is the
responsibility of the authorized employee to report the event to the card
Custodian. It is then the responsibility of the card Custodian to report the
card lost or stolen by phone directly to the card provider. It is important to
report all lost or stolen cards immediately since the City of Marietta will be
responsible for all transactions made until the card is reported lost or
stolen.
      (2)   A Custodian's quick response will reduce the risk of fraud. A
replacement card may be issued to the card Custodian within ten business days.
   (o)   Sales Tax. The City of Marietta is tax exempt. Authorized employees
must tell in-state suppliers the City is exempt from Ohio sales tax. A copy of
the City's Tax Exempt Certificate is available if the supplier needs to see it.
When traveling outside of the State of Ohio, hotel charges, food charges and
fuel charges will most likely be taxed since tax exemption applies only to
sales within the State of Ohio.
   (p)   Canceling Credit Cards. In order to cancel a credit card, the
Custodian will contact the credit card company.
   (q)   Renew Al of Existing Credit Cards. A renewal credit card will be sent
automatically to the Custodians thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date
of the existing card.
   (r)   Misusing Credit Cards.
      (1)   The credit card represents the City's trust in the authorized
employee and his/her empowerment as a responsible employee of the City of
Marietta to safeguard and protect its assets. Each authorized employee assumes
the responsibility for the protection and proper use of the card.
      (2)   The following situations are considered misuse of the credit card:
         A.   Personal use- Purchases using the card for the benefit of the
employee, e.g., clothing and food not authorized by the Custodian
         B.   Loaning out the card - Assignment, transfer, or loaning of an
individual card to an unauthorized person or to a suspended or terminated
employee
         C.   Administrative misuse - Lack of proper and timely reconciliation
of individual card accounts and card use that is in direct violation of
acquisition goals
      (3)   Misuse of the credit card shall be handled promptly and uniformly
for all Custodians and authorized employees.
      (4)   The following are the actions that may be taken in the event of
possible misuse: The credit card use may be suspended. The authorized employee
will be contacted by the Auditor of any instance of noncompliance.
      (5)   Based upon the severity of misuse, disciplinary measures may
include personnel action up to and including termination of employment and
legal action in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Cardholder
Agreement Form and the City of Marietta personnel policies. Additionally, if
the misuse of a credit card was done knowingly, the City may pursue criminal
prosecution.
   (s)    Conclusion.  City credit cards must be used responsibly. Each
authorized employee should be aware that improper use might result in
disciplinary action, up to and including termination and criminal prosecution.
The original receipts must be forwarded to the Auditor's Office.

susceptible of conciliation, the Board shall thereafter schedule a public
hearing to determine whether a violation of this chapter has been committed.

it deems necessary upon the giving of appropriate notice to the parties and in
conformity with the law of the State of Ohio, and cause action to be taken
thereon.

   161.03 SICK LEAVE.
   (a)   Each employee of the City shall accumulate sick leave at the rate of
four and six-tenths (4.6) hours for each eighty (80) hours of service in pay
status. Employees may use sick leave upon approval of the appropriate
administrative official for absence due to illness, injury, childbirth,

disease which could be communicated to other employees and the illness or death
in the employee's immediate family. Unused sick leave shall be accumulated
without limit.
   (b)    Previously accumulated sick leave of an employee who has separated
from public service or working with another agency shall be fully credited to
the employee upon
re-employment with the public service or transfer from another agency.
   (c)   To justify use of sick leave, the employee will complete a signed,
written statement explaining the nature of illness or other reason for taking
sick leave. No employee
shall be required to bring a doctor's statement prior to the third (3rd) day of
illness unless there is evidence of abuse of sick leave. The City reserves the
right to withhold benefit payments to any employee submitting a false claim or
abusing the privileges covered in this section. Abuse of sick leave will be the
subject of a conference between the employee and their supervisor prior to a
written reprimand. However, falsification of either the written, signed
statement or the physician's certificate are grounds for disciplinary action.
Disciplinary action taken hereunder shall be in accordance with the provisions
of the Civil Service Law of Ohio.
   (d)   An employee who is unable to report to work shall notify the immediate
supervisor or other designated person no less than one (1) hour prior to the
employee's time for reporting to work unless emergency conditions make such
reporting impossible.
   (e)    In the event that there is evidence of abuse of sick leave, the City
may require an employee to take an examination by a licensed physician to
determine physical or mental capability to perform the duties of the position.
The cost of such required examination will be paid by the City. The City shall
have the right to select the physician.
   (f)    An employee may be granted use of sick leave for up to three (3)
consecutive days for attendance upon members of the immediate family whose
illness or injury requires the care of the employee. "Immediate family" shall
mean the following family members of the employee's family: spouse, child,
stepchild, grandchild, parent, step parent, grandparent, sister, brother,
parent-in-law, other relative living in the same household or any person
standing in the place of a parent. Proof of relationship and illness or injury
may be required by the City as a condition of granting such leave. Additional
time may be granted at the discretion of the responsible administrative
authority. To the extent an employee needs additional time off (i.e. - due to a
serious health condition of a spouse or child), the employee will be granted
Family and Medical Leave per the FMLA of 1993.
   
   (g)    An employee may be granted one (1) day for the purposes of attending
the funeral of a member of the immediate family and an additional day for
attendance at the funeral of an immediate family member more than one hundred
miles from Marietta, Ohio. "Immediate family" shall include the family members
listed above in subsection (f) plus sister-in-law, brother-in-law, daughter-in-
law and son-in-law. Additional time may be granted hereunder at the discretion
of the responsible administrative authority.
   (h)    An employee may be granted up to two (2) days for attendance of the
wife related to childbirth.
   (i)    Upon the employee's request, vacation leave may be used as sick leave
after sick leave is exhausted. Employees who have exhausted sick leave and
vacation may, at the discretion of the responsible administrative authority, be
granted an unpaid personal leave of absence not to exceed the terms and
conditions of the Family Leave Act of 1993.
   (j)    All non-union employees and members of the Police Department of the
City hired after January 1, 1988; all IAFF employees hired after January 1,
1991 and Teamster employees hired after January 1, 1992, shall be eligible for
payment of fifty percent (50%) of their sick leave at the time of retirement up
to a maximum of 120 days' accumulation (a maximum of sixty (60) days' pay). For
purposes of this section an employee shall only be considered to have retired
if at the time of termination of their employment he/she is eligible to receive
retirement benefits under the age and service requirements of the Public
Employees Retirement System. Teamsters, FOP and IAFF members follow their
bargaining agreements.
   (k)    When an employee establishes through medical certification, that the
employee or a member of their immediate family has suffered a catastrophic life
or career threatening illness or injury and the employee has exhausted their
accrued sick and vacation leave, other City employees may donate in writing one
or more blocks of eight (8) hours of their own individual accrued and unused
leave to the employee. Leave shall be defined as including sick leave, vacation
leave and compensatory time off. An employee of the City of Marietta may donate
leave time to an employee of any bargaining unit or any non-union employee if
the donating employee retains a minimum leave balance of 200 hours. All donated
leave hours will be credited to the sick leave of the recipient employee. The
total number of such donated days shall not exceed thirty days (240 hours) per
catastrophic event as described above. For those employees working a 24-hour
shift the total amount of donated leave received shall not exceed 312 hours.
The recipient employee will not earn paid leave of any kind while using donated
leave time. Donated sick leave days cannot be used to extend or postpone any
period of time before the employee may begin disability retirement under the
applicable retirement system. The appropriate appointing authority shall
determine the details for the administration
of this section.
   For purposes of this section the term "immediate family" shall mean the
following
family members of the employee: mother, father, brother, sister, child, spouse,
grandparent, grandchild, legal guardian (or other person who stands in the
place of a parent), mother-in-law, father-in-law, or other relative living in
the same household.

of the City, none of whom are otherwise provided for by contract or separate
ordinance, shall receive health insurance benefits pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the agreement entered into between the City and the Michigan
Conference of Teamsters Welfare Fund, or any subsequent insurer. For purposes
of defraying the cost of the health insurance premiums each such eligible

(Ord. 147(04-05). Passed 2-17-05.)
   181.03 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)   Subject to the provisions of Section
181.15, an annual tax for the purposes and at the rate specified in Section
181.02 shall be imposed on and after January 1, 2005, upon the following:
      (1)   On all compensation and on net profits from the operation of a
business earned during the effective period of this Chapter by a resident.
      (2)   On all compensation earned or received by a nonresident for work
done or services performed or rendered in the City, subject to the limitations
provided in Ohio Revised Code Section 718.011, including any amendments or
successor provisions thereto, and on net profits earned or received by a
nonresident from the operation or conduct of business in the City. Where a
nonresident is employed at a place of business in the City, the compensation of
such nonresident for the performance of employee services will be treated as
earned outside the City only for those services which of necessity, as
distinguished from convenience, obligate such nonresident to duties outside the
City in the service of the nonresident’s employer.
      (3)    On the portion attributable to the City of the net profits earned
during the effective period of this Chapter of a pass-through entity derived
from business conducted in the City, whether or not such pass-through entity
has an office or place of business in the City. The tax imposed by this Section
181.03(a)(3) on the net profits of pass-through entities is imposed upon the
pass-through entities rather than their owners.
      (4)   On the portion attributable to the City of the net profits earned
during the effective period of this Chapter of a corporation derived from
business conducted in the City, whether or not such corporation has an office
or place of business in the City. The tax imposed by this Section
181.03(a)(4) on the net profits of an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company shall be subject to, and shall accord with, Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 5745, including any amendments or successor provisions thereto.
      (5)   On all income derived anywhere from prizes, awards, gaming,
wagering, lotteries, or schemes of chance by a resident, and on all income
derived from prizes, awards, gaming, wagering, lotteries, or schemes of chance
by a nonresident when such income is won or received from sources within the
City.
   (b)   The portion of the net profits attributable to the City of a taxpayer
conducting business both within and without the boundaries of the City shall be
determined as provided in Ohio Revised Code Section 718.02, including any
amendments or successor provisions thereto, and in accordance with rules and
regulations adopted by the Administrator pursuant to this Chapter.
   (c)   Net Operating Loss.
      (1)   The City does not allow a net operating loss carryback or
carryforward to any taxable year other than the taxable year in which the
taxpayer incurs the net operating loss.
      (2)   Losses from other sources, including net operating losses and
passive activity losses reported for federal income tax purposes, may not be
combined with or otherwise offset compensation.
   (d)   Filing of Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   The Administrator shall accept for filing a consolidated return
from an affiliated group of corporations subject to the tax imposed by this
Chapter if the affiliated group filed for the same taxable year a consolidated
return for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the Internal
Revenue Code. Only corporations subject to the tax imposed by this Chapter may
be included in such consolidated return filed for the City. If an affiliated
group of corporations subject to the tax imposed by this Chapter properly files
a consolidated return in accordance with this Section
181.03(d)(1) for any taxable year, the affiliated group must file a
consolidated return for each succeeding taxable year in which it files a
consolidated return for federal income tax purposes unless, on or before the
due date (taking into account extensions of time properly granted) of the
return for a taxable year, the affiliated group obtains the permission of the
Administrator to cease filing a consolidated return for that year.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation or other entity that carries on
transactions with its stockholders or owners or with other corporations or
entities related by stock ownership or other ownership, interlocking
directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates a division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the City constituting
only a portion of its total business, the Administrator shall require such
additional information as the Administrator deems necessary to ascertain
whether net profits are properly allocated to the City. If the Administrator
finds that the net profits of such corporation, other entity or person are not
properly allocated to the City by reason of transactions (i) with stockholders
or other owners or (ii) with other corporations or entities related by stock or
other ownership, interlocking directorates or some other method or (iii) with a
division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity, the Administrator
shall make an allocation of net profits to the City in such manner as the
Administrator deems fair and reasonable. If necessary, the Administrator may
require the filing of a City income tax return on a consolidated or unitary
basis.
   (e)   Exemptions. The City income tax shall not be levied on the following:
      (1)   Military pay or allowance of members of the armed forces of the
United States and of members of their reserve components, including the Ohio
National Guard.
      (2)   The income of religious, fraternal, charitable, scientific,
literary or educational institutions to the extent that such income is derived
from tax-exempt real estate, tax-exempt tangible or intangible property or tax-
exempt activities.
      (3)   Personal earnings of any natural person under eighteen years of
age.
      (4)   Intangible income, including interest, dividends, gains and other
revenue from intangible property, as described in Ohio Revised Code Section
718.01(A)(5), including any amendments or successor provisions thereto.
      (5)   Compensation paid to a nonresident individual to the extent
prohibited under Ohio Revised Code Section 718.011, including any amendments or
successor provisions thereto.
      (6)   Items excluded from federal gross income pursuant to Section 107 of
the Internal Revenue Code.
      (7)    An S corporation shareholder’s distributive share of net profits
or losses of the S corporation, except to the extent that the distributive
share of net profits represents wages as defined in Section 3121(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code or net earnings from self-employment as defined in
Section 1402(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (8)    Employee compensation that is not qualifying wages.
      (9)    Compensation, net profits and other items of income the taxation
of which is prohibited by the United States Constitution or any act of Congress
limiting the power of the states or their political subdivisions to impose net
income taxes on income derived from interstate commerce.
      (10)    Compensation, net profits and other items of income the taxation
of which is prohibited by the Constitution of the State of Ohio or any other
act of the Ohio General Assembly limiting the power of a municipality to impose
net income taxes.
      (11)    Generally, the above noted items in this Section
181.03(e) are the only forms of income not subject to the tax imposed by this
Chapter. Any other income, economic benefit or other form of compensation
earned or received by a taxpayer shall be subject to the tax imposed by this
Chapter.
   (f)   Deductions of Employee Business Expenses. The only expenses that can
be deducted against compensation are those employee business expenses
deductible for federal income tax purposes in determining adjusted gross
income, unless otherwise allowed on a uniform and consistent basis by the
Administrator. The total of such expenses cannot exceed the employee’s related
W-2 wage income from the same employer. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section
181.03(f), if a taxpayer’s taxable income for a taxable year includes income
against which the taxpayer has taken a deduction for federal income tax
purposes reported on Form2106 attached to the taxpayer’s federal income tax
return filed for that taxable year, the taxpayer shall determine his or her
taxable income to the City by deducting the same amount deducted for federal
income tax purposes and reported on the taxpayer’s Form2106 for that taxable
year and shall attach a copy of Form2106 and Schedule A filed with the
taxpayer’s federal income tax return to the taxpayer’s City return for that
taxable year.

   181.04 EFFECTIVE PERIOD.
   (EDITOR’S NOTE: This section was repealed by Ordinance 246(80-81), passed
November 19, 1981.)
   
   181.05 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   Each taxpayer having taxable income subject to tax under this Chapter,
whether or not a tax is due thereon, shall make and file a City income tax
return no later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month
following the end of the taxpayer’s taxable year. A City income tax return
shall be deemed filed when postmarked by the United States Postal Service or on
the date delivered other than by the United States Postal Service during normal
business hours to the Administrator. Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter
to the contrary, the return of an employer or employers that shows the amount
of City income tax deducted by the employer or employers from the compensation
of an employee and paid by the employer or employers to the Administrator shall
be accepted as the City income tax return required of any employee whose sole
income subject to City income tax consists of such compensation.       
   (b)   The return shall be filed with the Administrator on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Administrator, or on any form
that comports with Ohio Revised Code Section718.05(C), including any amendments
or successor provisions thereto, setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of compensation and other taxable income
earned or received by the taxpayer, and/or the gross receipts from the
taxpayer’s operation of a business less allowable expenses incurred in the
acquisition of such gross receipts earned during the taxpayer’s taxable year
and subject to City income tax;
      (2)   The amount of tax imposed by this Chapter on such compensation, net
profits and other taxable income;
      (3)   Any credits to which the taxpayer may be entitled under the
provisions of Sections
181.07 and
181.14; and
      (4)   Such other pertinent statements, returns or other information as
the Administrator may require, including a statement that the figures used in
the City income tax return are the figures used in the taxpayer’s federal
income tax return for that taxable year, adjusted to set forth only such income
as is taxable under the provisions of this Chapter.
   (c)   Extensions.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of the City income
tax return for the same taxable year by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s federal
extension request for such taxable year with the Administrator. Any taxpayer
not required to file a federal income tax return may make a written request for
an extension to file a City income tax return. The request for extension must
be filed on or before the original due date for the City income tax return, as
set forth in Section
181.05(a). If the request is granted, the extended due date of the City income
tax return shall be the last day of the month following the month to which the
due date of the taxpayer’s federal income tax return for the same taxable year
has been extended. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, a
taxpayer who receives an extension for filing the federal income tax return
will receive an extension for filing the City income tax return for the same
taxable year by complying with Ohio Revised Code Section 718.051(B), including
any amendments or successor provisions thereto, but such taxpayer must pay any
City income tax owed by the unextended due date for filing the City income tax
return, as provided in Section
181.05(d).
      (2)    The Administrator may deny a taxpayer’s request for an extension
of the due date to file the City income tax return if the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request;
          B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request, if
applicable;
         C.   Owes the City any delinquent income tax, penalty, interest or
other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of City income tax; or
         D.   Has failed to file any required City income tax return, report,
or other related document for a prior taxable year.
      (3)   The granting of an extension of the due date for filing a City
income tax return does not extend the due date as provided in this Section
181.05 for payment of the tax; hence, penalty and interest may apply to any
unpaid City income tax during the period of extension at the rate set out by
Section
181.10. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the City income
tax return is filed and the final tax paid within the extended period for
filing such return provided all other filing and payment requirements of this
Chapter have been met. The Administrator shall grant any extension of the due
date for filing the City income tax return upon the condition that all City
income tax declaration filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled;
however, if, upon further examination it then becomes evident that such
declaration filing and payment requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty
and interest may be assessed in full and in the same manner as though no
extension of the due date for filing the City income tax return had been
granted.
   (d)   The taxpayer making the City income tax return shall, at the time of
the filing thereof, pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due
thereon. However, where any portion of the tax so due shall have been deducted
at the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.06, or where any portion of such tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to the provisions of Sections
181.05 and
181.07, credit for the amount so paid shall be deducted from the amount shown
to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the City income tax return.
   (e)   An amended return must be filed to report additional income and pay
any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax overpaid subject to the
requirements and/or limitations contained in Sections
181.11 and
181.14. An amended return shall be filed on a form obtainable upon request from
the Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
   (f)   Subject to the limitation on the period for assessment of City income
tax and claims for refund thereof prescribed by Ohio Revised Code Section
718.12, including any amendments or successor provisions thereto, within three
months from the final determination of any federal tax liability affecting the
taxpayer's City income tax liability for the same taxable year(s), such
taxpayer shall make and file an amended City income tax return for such year(s)
showing income subject to City income tax based upon such final determination
of federal tax liability and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make
claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (g)   Should the City income tax return or the records of the Administrator
indicate an overpayment of the tax to which the City is entitled under the
provisions of this Chapter, such overpayment shall first be applied against any
existing liability of the taxpayer to the City, and the balance, if any, at the
election of the taxpayer indicated on the return, shall be refunded or
transferred against any subsequent liability of the taxpayer to the City,
provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00)
shall be collected or refunded.
(Ord. 147(04-05). Passed 2-17-05.)
   181.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CONTRACT SERVICES AND RENTAL INCOME.
   (a)   Each employer within or doing business within the City who or that
employs one or more employees shall, at the time of payment of compensation,
deduct the City income tax from the gross compensation paid to a taxpayer for
work done or services performed or rendered in the City by the taxpayer.
   (b)   Each employer shall, on or before the last day of the month, make a
return and remit to the Administrator the City income tax withheld from
employee compensation in the previous month. Such return shall be on a form or
forms prescribed by or acceptable to the Administrator and shall be subject to
the rules and regulations prescribed therefore by the Administrator. Such
employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and
withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld. However, if the
amount of City income tax so deducted by an employer in any one calendar
quarter is less than one thousand dollars ($1,000), the employer may defer the
filing of a return and payment of the amount deducted until the last day of the
month following the end of such calendar quarter.
   (c)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2007, any employer
subject to this Section
181.06 may use the Ohio business gateway both to report the amount of City
income tax withheld from compensation and to remit such amounts.
   (d)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual’s disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (e)   An employee is not relieved from liability for City income tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by this Section
181.06 or by the employer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold City
income tax.
   (f)   The failure of an employer to remit the City income tax withheld
relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded
with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the City income tax
withheld.
   (g)   On or before each January 31, each employer subject to the provisions
of this Section181.06 shall file with the Administrator an information return
for each employee from whom city income tax has been or should have been
withheld, showing the name, address and Social Security number of the employee,
the total amount of compensation paid during the year to such employee and the
amount of City income tax withheld from such employee and shall provide a copy
of such information return to the employee.
   (h)   The employer, in collecting City income tax, shall be deemed to hold
the same as a trustee for the benefit of the City until payment is made by such
employer to the City, and such tax collected by such employer from its
employees shall be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer until the
same is paid to the City.
   (i)   On or before each January 31, any person, business or other entity who
contracts or otherwise engages another person, business or other entity to
perform services or conduct business activities for remuneration in any form,
including, but not limited to, the sale of real estate, the sale of insurance,
construction, transportation or other contract or subcontract services, shall
file with the Administrator an information return, which shall include the
proper name, address, federal identification number and the amount of such
remuneration paid during the prior calendar year to such person, business or
other entity.
   (j)   On or before each January 31 and each July31, any person engaged in
the rental of real estate and that receives rental income shall file with the
Administrator a list of tenants as of December31 and June30, respectively,
including the name and address of each tenant.
   (k)   Any return or form required to be filed under this Section
181.06 is considered filed on the date postmarked by the United States Post
Office or on the date delivered other than by the United States Postal Service
during normal business hours to the Administrator.
(Ord. 147(04-05). Passed 2-17-05.)
   181.07 DECLARATIONS.
    (a)   Every person who anticipates any taxable income that is not subject
to the provisions of Section
181.06, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
subject to City income tax, shall file a declaration setting forth such
estimated income or the estimated profit or loss from such business activity,
together with the estimated City income tax due thereon, if any. For taxable
years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, declarations of estimated net
profits from any business conducted within the City and payment of estimated
city income tax thereon may be made by using the Ohio business gateway, as
described in Ohio Revised Code Section 718.051, including any amendments or
successor provisions thereto.
 
   (b)   Such declaration of estimated City income tax for a taxable year that
is a calendar year shall be filed on or before April 15 of each year during the
life of this chapter, or within four months of the date the taxpayer becomes
subject to City income tax for the first time.
   (c)   Such declaration of estimated tax shall be filed on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable from the Commissioner of Taxation or on a generic
form prescribed by Ohio Revised Code Section 718.05, including any amendments
or successor provisions thereto, which form or forms may require a statement
that the taxpayer’s declaration of estimated City taxable income equals the
taxpayer’s estimated federal taxable income as adjusted so that City taxable
income includes only those items that are taxable under this Chapter.
   (d)   (1)   Such declaration of estimated tax for a taxable year that is a
calendar year shall be accompanied by payment of at least twenty-two and one-
half percent of the estimated annual tax and, in the case of individuals, at
least a similar amount must be paid on or before July 31 and October 31 of that
taxable year and January 31 of the subsequent taxable year. A calendar year
taxpayer having net profits subject to City income tax must file the
declaration of estimated tax by April 15 and pay at least twenty- two and one-
half percent of the estimated annual tax by that date, and at least a similar
amount must be paid by June 15, September 15 and December 15 of such taxpayer’s
taxable year. The estimate may be amended at any time prior to the due date of
the taxpayer’s annual City income tax return for the taxable year for which the
estimated payments are made. The annual City income tax return must be filed
and any balance of City income tax that may be due must be paid on or before
the due date set forth in Section
181.05. If the taxpayer has paid more than the amount of tax to which the City
is entitled, a refund of the amount so overpaid shall be made or the same may
be applied toward the declaration of tax due for the ensuing taxable year.
Claims for refunds shall be made on forms prescribed or approved by the
Commissioner of Taxation and within the time provided in Section
181.11.
      (2)   An amended declaration must be filed on or before January 31 of any
year, or in the case of a taxpayer on a fiscal year accounting basis, on or
before the date fixed by regulation of the Commissioner of Taxation, if it
appears that the original declaration made for the preceding taxable year
underestimated the taxpayer's income by twenty percent (20%) or more. At such
time a payment that, together with prior payment is sufficient to pay
taxpayer's entire estimated liability, shall be made. If upon the filing of the
annual City income tax return required by Section
181.05 hereof, it appears that the taxpayer did not pay at least ninety percent
(90%) of the City income tax liability shown on such return on or before
January 31 or the date fixed by regulation, whichever is applicable, the
difference between ninety percent (90%) of the taxpayer's City income tax
liability and the amount of estimated tax actually paid on or before January 31
or the date fixed by regulation, whichever is applicable, shall be subject to
the interest and penalty provisions of Section
181.10. However, the interest and penalty provisions of Section
181.10 shall not apply where either: (i) the taxpayer is a resident but was not
domiciled in the City on January 1 of the calendar year; or (ii) the taxpayer
has remitted on a timely basis an amount of estimated City income tax at least
equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the taxpayer’s City income tax liability
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the return for the preceding
taxable year reflected a 12-month period and the taxpayer filed a City income
tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (3)   Such declaration shall indicate that the estimated tax is being
withheld under the provisions of Section
181.06 or is being paid to another municipality.
   (e)   Those taxpayers having a taxable year other than the calendar year
shall file a declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
after the start of each fiscal year or period, accompanied by a payment of at
least twenty-two and one-half percent of the estimated annual tax shown due
thereon, and shall make quarterly payments of at least a similar amount each on
the fifteenth day of the sixth month, ninth month and twelfth month of the
taxpayer's taxable year.
   (f)   An annual City income tax return shall be filed by the date prescribed
by Section
181.05(a) and any balance that may be due the City shall be paid therewith in
accordance with the provisions of Section
181.05.

of the Treasurer as Administrator, is authorized to arrange for the payment of
unpaid taxes, interest and penalties on a schedule of installment payments when
the taxpayer has proved to the Treasurer or Administrator, as the case may be,
that, due to certain hardship conditions, he or she is unable to pay the full
amount of the tax due. Such authorization shall not be granted until the
taxpayer files proper returns for all amounts owed by him or her under this
Chapter. Failure to make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total
unpaid amount, including penalty and interest, to become payable on demand, and
the provisions of Sections
181.11 and
181.99 shall apply.
   (e)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Treasurer, and
any authorized deputy performing any of the duties of the Treasurer as
Administrator, may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the City
from the taxpayer and shall send to such taxpayer a written statement showing
the amount of tax so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon,
if any.
   (f)   The Treasurer, and any authorized deputy performing any of the duties
of the Treasurer as Administrator, shall be required to post a bond
guaranteeing to the City his faithful performance of his duties under this
Chapter. The amount of such bond and a listing of the acceptable issuers
thereof shall be established pursuant to ordinances adopted from time to time
by Council.

believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter, for the purpose of
verifying the accuracy of any return made, or, if no return was made, to
ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Every such employer, supposed

order or subpoena of the Administrator authorized hereby, shall be deemed a
violation of this Chapter, punishable as provided in Section
181.99.

obligation that is subject to appeal, the Administrator shall notify the
taxpayer at the same time of the taxpayer’s right to appeal the decision and
the manner in which the taxpayer may appeal the decision.

Chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
ORC, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this Chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax

taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
         (a)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.

The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than

         (c)   The Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this section, but
only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by
Section
183.12 (A).

the rate, specified in Section
183.03 of this Chapter; for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, this

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue

payment and subsequent payments, based on the Administrator's determination,
may be required to be made by electronic funds transfer to the Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City of Marietta. The payment
of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an
employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required
under this section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division may be accepted by the Administrator and the City of Marietta as the
return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the
tax under this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the City of Marietta income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the City of Marietta the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
City of Marietta income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent
the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City of Marietta until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer

or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City of
Marietta income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees
and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for

to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City of Marietta exceeds the 20-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the City of Marietta for any
subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the City of Marietta.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City of
Marietta under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
the City of Marietta for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the City of
Marietta.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the City of Marietta and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
183.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
City of Marietta, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of the City of Marietta. To determine whether
an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable year, the employer will
be required to provide the Administrator with the employer's federal income tax
return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that the Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding
the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
183.04.
         (Ord. 73(18-19). Passed 11-15-18.)
   183.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual City of Marietta income tax return shall be completed and
filed by every individual taxpayer eighteen (18) years of age or older and any
taxpayer that is not an individual for each taxable year for which the taxpayer
is subject to the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)    The Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
 183.04 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due the City of Marietta.
       (2)    Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for the City of
Marietta income tax purposes may file with the Administrator a written
exemption from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the
Administrator. The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and
the entity from which retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time
as the retiree receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the City of
Marietta, at which time the retiree shall be required to comply with all
applicable provisions of this chapter.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the City of Marietta, the return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care
of the person or property of that individual.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.
   (E)    The City of Marietta shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)    The Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual to
include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of the following
documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and
Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's federal
W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and, with
respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to support
the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files
the annual return required by this section electronically is not required to
provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Administrator unless the
Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed. Further,
under the authority of division (F)(4) of this section, it is the policy of the
City of Marietta to also review the Ohio form IT-1040, and therefore it is
requested that this form be submitted with the filing of the original annual
return of the taxpayer, in order to expedite the review of the return.
      (3)    The Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an individual
to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or
request for refund required under this section, copies of only the following
documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form
1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an
amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary to
support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Administrator at
the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City of Marietta to determine and verify the
taxpayer's municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under
division (F) of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on
a generic form or on a form prescribed by the Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the City of Marietta. No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
         (b)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Administrator on
or before the fifteenth day (15th) of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Administrator or on generic forms, together
with remittance made payable to the City of Marietta. No remittance is required
if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City of Marietta's
income tax return. The extended due date of the City of Marietta's income tax
return shall be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the
taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file under
this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the
Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the City of Marietta's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension
of the date for filing the taxpayer's City of Marietta income tax return. If
the request is received by the Administrator on or before the date the City of
Marietta income tax return is due, the Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's
requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
City of Marietta's income tax return. The extended due date of the City of
Marietta's income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the
state income tax return.
       (4)    If the Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City of Marietta, the Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the City of Marietta
shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the
net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City of Marietta for
a taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
City of Marietta an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this
section.
   (I)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except that,
when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
 183.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the City of Marietta by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
 183.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the City of Marietta, unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the City of Marietta and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the City of Marietta to be filed in
accordance with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check
to authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the
return, to communicate with the Administrator about matters pertaining to the
return.
   (L)    The Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City of Marietta,
provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the City of Marietta or the Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or
tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the
provisions of this Chapter and of the City of Marietta's ordinance, resolution,
or rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or
documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the City of
Marietta's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Administrator of the City of
Marietta for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the City of Marietta during
the period of the member's or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days
thereafter. The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred
eightieth day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant
shall provide such evidence as the Administrator considers necessary to
demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the Administrator shall enter into a
contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in installments that
begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
The Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as the Administrator
considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under
this division are not delinquent, and the Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
      (2)    If the Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified for
an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the City of Marietta before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
        (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by the City of Marietta in
accordance with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces of the United States called to active duty pursuant to either an
executive order issued by the president of the United States or an act of the
congress of the United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a
combat zone or contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
          (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division
(P)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Administrator shall
not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes
for the extension period. The Administrator shall not include any period of
extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in calculating the
penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.

purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City of
Marietta's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a
change in the reporting method is required under federal law. The election
continues to be binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the
taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns
under division (S)(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from
the Administrator. The Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City of Marietta income tax return for that taxable year if
the Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the City of Marietta. A taxpayer that is required
to file a consolidated City of Marietta income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated City of Marietta income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission
from the Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced
a change in circumstances.

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
183.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
       (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated City of Marietta income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
183.02 (C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City of Marietta income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
183.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Marietta. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
183.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Marietta. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
 183.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Marietta;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City of
Marietta income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter
on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated City of Marietta income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
183.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated City of Marietta income tax
return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the City of Marietta in accordance with
this Chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation
is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of
such an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City of Marietta before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the City of Marietta may continue to
file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016. (Ord. 380
(14-15). Passed 12-3-15.)
   183.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the City of Marietta who is
required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this Chapter may
claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the
other municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall
not exceed the tax due the City of Marietta under this Chapter.
   (B)    The City of Marietta shall grant a credit against its tax on income
to a resident of the City of Marietta who works in a joint economic development
zone created under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district
created under Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)    Intentionally left blank.

were actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the
dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
          (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the

Marietta, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and
withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
183.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the City of Marietta under Section
183.05 for that year.
       (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City of Marietta
but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year
that includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 380(14-15). Passed 12-3-15.)
   183.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document. (Ord. 380(14-15). Passed 12-3-15.)
   183.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
183.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the City of Marietta:
      (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is
later. The Administrator may require the requestor to file with the request any
documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Administrator shall determine
the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except as
provided in division (C)(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an
assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially
denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was denied,
the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If the Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
183.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
183.18 (A)(4). (Ord. 380(14-15). Passed 12-3-15.)
   183.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR
REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the City of Marietta, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City
of Marietta as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City of Marietta is subject to recovery by the
City of Marietta. If the City of Marietta's tax on that income is imposed after
the time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the
other municipality, the City of Marietta shall allow a nonrefundable credit
against the tax or withholding the City of Marietta claims is due with respect
to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first
municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)    If the City of Marietta's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the
other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City of Marietta's tax rate. However, if the City of Marietta's tax rate is
greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of
the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the City of Marietta, along with any
penalty and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.   
(Ord. 380(14-15). Passed 12-3-15.)
   183.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the City of Marietta changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with the City of Marietta. The amended return shall be filed on a form required
by the Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Administrator before filing the amended
return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
183.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the City of Marietta. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
 183.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City of Marietta's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended City of Marietta return showing income
subject to the City of Marietta income tax based upon such final determination
of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional City
of Marietta income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars.
(Ord. 380(14-15). Passed 12-3-15.)
   183.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Review the request described in Section
183.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Review did not
have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of
that assessment.
           (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Review, the sixtieth day after
the date on which the final determination of the Board of Review is either
ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no further
appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that reversal is
available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
183.09. 
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City of Marietta does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
       (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Review, of the Ohio board of
tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
183.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
 183.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover the City of Marietta income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 380(14-15). Passed 12-3-15.)
   183.13  AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Administrator
and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights,
including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of a tax. At or before
the commencement of an audit, the Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when
the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Administrator shall prescribe a form by which a
taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the taxpayer in the
conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Administrator. If a
taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Administrator may accept other
evidence, as the Administrator considers appropriate, that a person is the
authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Administrator to comply with a provision of this
section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by the
taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 380(14-
15). Passed 12-3-15.)
   183.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a change
of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery
service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Administrator, except when the reason
for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address,
the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Administrator or other City of Marietta official, or
the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local Board of Review within 60 days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Administrator under
division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is
complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by the Administrator by certified mail
is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Administrator as shown
on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed apply
from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary mail
and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes
of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time the
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Administrator or other City of Marietta
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise
with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the
local Board of Review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Administrator or the
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 380(14-15). Passed 12-3-15.)
   183.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City of Marietta that arises pursuant to the City of Marietta's income
tax imposed in accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Administrator from doing either
of the following if such action is in the best interests of the City of
Marietta:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 380(14-15). Passed 12-3-15.)
   183.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City of
Marietta as authorized by this Chapter. The Administrator or a designee thereof
may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter
and other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the state
tax commissioner, and administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the City of Marietta from publishing
or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with
respect to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 380(14-15). Passed 12-3-15.)
   183.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City of Marietta ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the City of Marietta or the
Administrator.

         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to the City of Marietta on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the City of Marietta to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be

   183.19 AUTHORITY OF ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)    Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the authority of the
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of

provide identifying information that has experienced
any change with respect to that information shall notify the Administrator of
the change before, or upon, filing the next tax document requiring the

administrative official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,

the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the appointment of
the member temporarily unable to serve.

its location. (Ord. 14(20-21). Passed 3-5-20.)
   307.02 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of the private property may establish a private tow-away
zone only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The owner posts on his property a sign, that is at least eighteen
inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible from all entrances to the

not exceed two hundred sixteen dollars ($216.00), and the storage charge shall
not exceed twenty-nine dollars ($29.00) per twenty-four-hour period, if the
vehicle has a manufacturer's gross vehicle weight rating in excess of 10,000
pounds and is a truck, bus or a combination of a commercial tractor and trailer
or semitrailer.
      (2)    The place to which the towed vehicle is taken and from which it
may be recovered is conveniently located, is well-lighted and is on or within a
reasonable distance of a regularly scheduled route of one or more modes of
public transportation, if any public transportation is available in the
Municipality.
   (b)   If a vehicle is parked on private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) hereof without the
consent of the owner of the property or in violation of any posted parking
condition or regulation, the owner or his agent may remove, or cause the
removal of the vehicle. The owner and the operator of the vehicle shall be
deemed to have consented to the removal and storage of the vehicle and to the
payment of the towing and storage charges specified in subsection (a) hereof,
and the owner may recover a vehicle that has been so removed only in accordance
with Section
307.03.
   (c)   If an owner of private property that is established as a private tow-
away zone in accordance with subsection (a) hereof or the authorized agent of
such an owner removes or causes the removal of a vehicle from that property
under authority of subsection (b) hereof, the owner or agent promptly shall

   307.03 RELEASE OF VEHICLE; RECORDS; CHARGES.
   (a)   Release Prior to Removal. If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle
that has been ordered into storage pursuant to Section
307.01 or of a vehicle that is being removed under authority of Section
307.02 arrives after the motor vehicle or vehicle has been prepared for removal
but prior to its actual removal from the property, the owner or operator shall
be given the opportunity to pay a fee of not more than one-half of the charge
for the removal of a motor vehicle under Section
307.01 or of vehicles under Section
307.02, whichever is applicable, that normally is assessed by the person who
has prepared the motor vehicle or vehicle for removal, in order to obtain
release of the motor vehicle or vehicle. Upon payment of that fee, the motor
vehicle or vehicle shall be released to the owner or operator, and upon its
release, the owner or operator immediately shall move it so that:
      (1)    If the motor vehicle was ordered into storage pursuant to Section
307.01, it is not on the private property without the permission of the person
having the right to possession of the property, or is not at the garage or
place of storage without the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable;
      (2)    If the vehicle was being removed under authority of Section
307.02, it is not parked on the private property established as private tow-
away zone without the consent of the owner or in violation of any posted
parking condition or regulation.
   (b)   Records. The Municipal Police Department shall maintain a record of
motor vehicles that have been ordered into storage pursuant to Section
307.01 and of vehicles removed from private property that has been established
as a private tow-away zone of which notice has been given to the Municipal
Police Department under Section
307.02. Any information in the record that pertains to a particular motor
vehicle or vehicle shall be provided to any person who, either in person or
pursuant to a telephone call, identifies himself as the owner or operator of
the motor vehicle or vehicle and requests information pertaining to its
location.
   (c)   Removal and Storage Charges. The owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage pursuant to Section
307.01 or of a vehicle that is removed under authority of Section 307.02 may
reclaim it upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal, in
an amount not to exceed one hundred twenty-nine dollars ($129.00), and storage,
in an amount not to exceed seventeen dollars ($17.00) per twenty-four hour
period; except that the charge for towing shall not exceed two hundred sixteen
dollars ($216.00), and the storage charge shall not exceed twenty-nine dollars
($29.00) per twenty-four-hour period, if the vehicle has a manufacturer's gross
vehicle weight rating in excess of 10,000 pounds and is a truck, bus or a
combination of a commercial tractor and trailer or semitrailer. Presentation of
proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a certificate of title to the
motor vehicle or vehicle also shall be required for reclamation of the vehicle.

307.01 remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty days, the procedures
established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 shall apply.
(ORC 4513.60; Ord. 14(20-21). Passed 3-5-20.)
   307.04 LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk motor
vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property or on a public
street or other property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or
parking, or upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, without
notification to the Municipal Police Department of the reasons for leaving the
vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
(Ord. 14(20-21). Passed 3-5-20.)
    307.05 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
unhoused on private property for more than seventy-two hours with the
permission of the person having the right to the possession of the property,
except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal processing
facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12; or regulated
under authority of the Municipality; or if the person having the right to the
possession of the property on which the motor vehicle is left can establish
that the motor vehicle is a licensed collector's vehicle.
   (b)   Persons having the right to the possession of the property may store
or keep by unrestricted method any licensed collector's vehicle as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F).
   (c)   The Municipal Police Department or the Municipal Zoning Authority may
send notice by personal service or by certified mail, with return receipt
requested, to the person having the right to the possession of the property on
which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of receipt of the
notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a
garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the property.
   (d)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle in the open for
more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. The
fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of willful
failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty days that a
junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate offense.
(Ord. 14(20-21). Passed 3-5-20.)
   307.06 PROHIBITION ON REMOVING IMPOUNDED VEHICLE FROM PLACE OF STORAGE.
   No owner, operator or lienholder shall remove an impounded vehicle from the
place of storage without complying with the procedure provided by law.
Possession of a vehicle which has been impounded and unlawfully taken from the
place of storage, by the owner, operator or lienholder, shall constitute prima-
facie evidence that it was so removed by the owner, operator or lienholder.
(Ord. 14(20-21). Passed 3-5-20.)
   307.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever violates Section
307.02(f) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
   (b)    Whoever violates Section
307.04 involving a vehicle or "junk motor vehicle" left on private property is

the Municipality in disposing of any vehicle or abandoned junk motor vehicle,
less any money accruing to the Municipality from such disposal.

307.04 involving a vehicle or "junk motor vehicle" left on a public street or
other property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking,
or upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, is not guilty of a
criminal offense and shall not be arrested as a result of the commission of the
violation. The violation shall be handled through the civil Parking Violations
Bureau established by Chapter
353 of the Marietta Codified Ordinances.
   (d)   Whoever violates Section
307.05 is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a first offense; on a second

   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be

provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
   (e)   The following streets shall be through streets and shall have the
right of way of travel over all intersecting streets except State and Federal
highways:

   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the

device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United

a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal

those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains

The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the
offender to a jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days
that the offender does not spend attending the program. The court may require
the offender, as a condition of community control and in addition to the
required attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, to attend and
satisfactorily complete any treatment or education programs that comply with
the minimum standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the
Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the
drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender should attend and to
report periodically to the court on the offender’s progress in the programs.
The court also may impose on the offender any other conditions of community
control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term

monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court

subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,

and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared

minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate

for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of

   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.11 or Ohio R.C. 4510.111 or

for thirty days and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates for thirty
days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.

of two violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11 or Ohio R.C. 4510.111 or 4510.16, or of
a substantially similar municipal ordinance, the court, in addition to any
other sentence that it imposes on the offender may order the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11, or any
combination of three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4501.11 or Ohio R.C.

court, in addition to any other sentence that it imposes on the offender may
order the criminal forfeiture of the vehicle involved in the offense to the

from the court, neither the Ohio Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy
registrar shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of
registration of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the
declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having

necessary measures to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased
by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or

   (h)   Any person whose driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privileges are suspended as a repeat traffic offender
under this section and who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle
upon any public roads and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point
suspension, a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the
offender to a minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the
first three days of jail time imposed pursuant to this subsection. (ORC

enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual

the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
 
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor

   353.03 PARKING TICKETS; SERVICE.
   (a)    Adoption. A parking ticket, in the form prescribed by division (b) of
this section, is hereby adopted and shall be used in all cases in which a
person is charged with committing a parking violation subject to the
jurisdiction of the Parking Violations Bureau. In the alternative, the "Ohio
Uniform Traffic Ticket" described in State Traffic Rule 3(A) and (B) may be
used as the parking ticket. Any parking ticket issued for a parking violation
pursuant to this section shall be the summons and complaint for the purposes of
this Chapter.
   (b)    Contents. A parking ticket issued for a violation of any provision
subject to the jurisdiction of the Parking Violations Bureau shall contain
provisions that:
      (1)    Advise the person to whom the ticket is issued that he or she must
answer in relation to the parking violation charged in the ticket;
      (2)    Advise the person to whom the ticket is issued that if he or she
fails to answer in a timely manner, additional penalties shall apply;
      (3)    Specify the allowable answers that may be made to the parking
violation charged, as provided in Section
353.04;
      (4)    Advise the person that he or she will be afforded a hearing if he
or she denies in his or her answer that he or she committed the parking
violation;
      (5)    Specify the entity to which, the time within which, and the
allowable manners in which the answer must be made;
      (6)    Indicate the penalties that may result from failure to timely
answer and the fine that arises from the parking ticket;
      (7)    Warn that failure to timely answer or to appear at a requested
hearing will be considered an admission of the parking violation;
      (8)    Warn that a default civil judgment potentially may be entered
against the person and, if different, the owner of the vehicle if the person
fails to timely answer or to appear at a requested hearing; and
      (9)    Any other information as required by law.
   (c)    Duty of Issuing Officer. The law enforcement officer issuing the
parking ticket shall complete the parking ticket by:
      (1)    Identifying the parking violation charged;
      (2)    Recording the license plate number, type, and make or model of the
vehicle;
      (3)    Indicating the date, time and place of the violation;
      (4)    Signing the ticket and affirming the facts it contains; and
      (5)    Identifying the offender and serving the ticket by one of the
following methods:
         A.    If the operator of the vehicle is present, the officer shall
record on the parking ticket, in the space provided for identification of the
offender, the name of the operator and shall then personally serve the ticket
upon the operator.
         B.    If the operator of the vehicle is not present, the officer shall
insert the word "owner" in the space provided for the identification of the
offender and shall then constructively serve the parking ticket upon the owner
of the vehicle by affixing it to the vehicle in a conspicuous place.
   
   (d)    Constructive Service.
      (1)    Constructive service of a parking ticket upon an owner of a
vehicle by affixation as provided in subsection (c)(5) of this section, or by
the procedure described in subsection (d)(2) of this section, has the same
force and effect, and potentially subjects both the owner and the operator of
the vehicle whose act or omission resulted in the parking infraction, if
different, to the same fine and the same penalties for failure to timely answer
or to appear, if a hearing is requested, as if the parking ticket were
personally served on both the owner and operator of the vehicle at the time of
the violation.
      (2)    An operator of a vehicle who is not the owner of the vehicle, but
who operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner is the
agent of the owner for purposes of the receipt of parking tickets served in
accordance with this section, and personal service of a parking ticket upon the
operator in accordance with this section constitutes constructive service upon
the owner for purposes of this Chapter. The operator of a rented or leased
vehicle whose act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction shall
not be considered an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the business
of renting and leasing vehicles pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement
and if the owner follows the procedures set forth in Section
353.09 of this Chapter.
   (e)    Joint Liability. Except as provided in Section
353.09 of this Chapter, when a parking ticket is issued for a parking
infraction and is served pursuant to this section, the operator of the vehicle
whose act or omission resulted in the parking infraction for which the ticket
was issued and the owner of the vehicle involved in the parking infraction, if
different, are jointly liable for the parking infraction and any fine or
penalty arising out of the parking infraction. Any owner of a vehicle who pays
any fine or penalty imposed for a parking infraction pursuant to this Chapter
may recover the amount paid from the operator of the vehicle whose act or
omission resulted in the parking infraction.
   (f)    No Arrest. No person upon whom a parking ticket charging a parking
violation subject to the jurisdiction of the Parking Violations Bureau is
served shall be arrested as a result of the commission of the parking
violation.
   (g)    Records. The original of the parking ticket issued pursuant to this
section or any true copy of the same shall be considered a record kept in the
ordinary course of business of the City and the Police Department, and shall be
prima facie evidence of the facts it contains.

      (1)    If the person for whom the hearing is being conducted appears at
the scheduled hearing or submits evidence in accordance with subsection (c)(3)
of this section, the hearing examiner shall consider all evidence and testimony
presented and shall determine whether the City has established, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the person committed the parking violation.
If the hearing examiner determines that the person committed the parking
violation, an order indicating the determination as a judgment against the
person and requiring the person to pay the appropriate fine and any additional
penalties and/or hearing costs shall be entered in the records of the Parking
Violations Bureau.
      (2)    If the person for whom the hearing is being conducted fails to
appear at the scheduled hearing and fails to submit evidence in accordance with
subsection (c)(3) of this section, the hearing examiner shall, if he or she

preponderance of the evidence, that the person committed the parking violation,
enter a default judgment against the person and require the person to pay the
appropriate fine and any additional penalties and/or hearing costs. A default
judgment entered under this division shall be entered in the records of the
Parking Violations Bureau.
      (3)    If a person who is sent a notification of violation pursuant to

Bureau.
      (4)    If the hearing examiner does not determine, by a preponderance of

examiner shall enter judgment against the City and shall enter the judgment and
dismissal in the records of the Parking Violations Bureau. No additional
penalties or hearing costs shall be entered against the person if the hearing
examiner finds the person did not commit the parking violation.
   (f)    Default Judgments. A default judgment entered under this section may
be vacated by the hearing examiner who entered it if all of the following
apply:
      (1)    The person against whom the default judgment was entered files a
motion with the Parking Violations Bureau within one (1) year of the date of
entry of the judgment;
      (2)    The motion sets forth a sufficient defense to the parking

   (a)    Payment of Judgments. Payment of any judgment or default judgment
entered against a person pursuant to this Chapter shall be made to the Parking

money paid in satisfaction of a judgment or default judgment shall be disbursed
by the Clerk to the City's General Fund, and the Clerk shall enter the fact of

payment is not made within the required ten (10) days, the Parking Violation

in Section

the Clerk of the Marietta Municipal Court, and when so filed, shall have the
same force and effect as a money judgment in a civil action rendered in the
Court.
   (b)    Judgments Filed with the Marietta Municipal Court. Judgments and
default judgments filed with a court pursuant to this division shall be
maintained in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4521.08(C). When a judgment or default
judgment is filed with the Court, execution may be levied, and such other
measures may be taken for its collection as are authorized for the collection
of an unpaid money judgment in a civil action rendered in the Court. The
Marietta Municipal Court may assess costs against the judgment debtor, in an
amount not exceeding ten dollars ($10.00) for each parking violation, to be
paid upon satisfaction of the judgment.
   (c)    Appeals. Any person against whom a judgment or default judgment is
entered pursuant to Section
353.07, and the City if a judgment is entered against it pursuant to Section
353.07, may appeal the judgment or default judgment to the Marietta Municipal
Court if the judgment or default judgment was entered by the bureau, or to the
Washington County Juvenile Court if the judgment or default judgment was
entered by a referee of the Juvenile Court, by filing notices of appeal with
the Parking Violations Bureau or the referee of the Juvenile Court, and the
Marietta Municipal Court or the Clerk of the Juvenile Court within fifteen (15)
days of the date of entry of the judgment and by the payment of such reasonable
costs as the Marietta Municipal Court or the Washington County Juvenile Court
requires. Upon the filing of an appeal, the applicable court shall schedule a
hearing date and notify the parties of the date, time, and place of the
hearing. The hearing shall be held by the applicable court in accordance with
the rules of the court. Service of a notice of appeal under this subsection by
a person does not stay enforcement and collection of the judgment or default
judgment from which appeal is taken by the person unless the person who files
the appeal posts bond with the Parking Violations Bureau or the Washington
County Juvenile Court in the full amount of the judgment, plus court costs, at
or before the service of the notice of appeal. Notwithstanding any other
provision of law, the judgment on appeal of the Marietta Municipal Court or the
Washington County Juvenile Court is final, and no other appeal of the judgment
of the Parking Violations Bureau, or the referee of the Juvenile Court,
whichever is applicable, and no appeal of the judgment of the Marietta
Municipal Court or the Juvenile Court may be taken.
   (d)    Time for Filing Judgment. A judgment or default judgment entered
pursuant to Section
353.07 may be filed with the Marietta Municipal Court under division (b) of
this section at any time within three (3) years after the date of issuance of
the parking ticket charging the parking violation out of which the judgment
arose.

being used by the operator without the owner's express or implied consent, and
the Parking Violations Bureau or the Washington County Juvenile Court
determines that the vehicle was being used without the owner's express or
implied consent at that time. If the Bureau or the Juvenile Court does not so
determine, it shall conduct the hearing concerning the parking violation
according to Section

was engaged in the business of renting or leasing vehicles under written rental
or lease agreements, and the owner additional submits evidence that proves
that, at the time of the alleged commission of the parking violation, the
vehicle in question was in the care, custody, or control of a person other than

      (1)    An owner of a vehicle who is engaged in the business of renting or
leasing vehicles under written rental or lease agreements, but who does not
satisfy the additional requirements of division (a)(2) of this section is not
liable for any penalties or processing fees arising out of a parking violation
involving the vehicle if at the time of the commission of the parking
violation, the vehicle was in the care, custody, or control of a person other
than the owner pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement, and if the
owner answers the charge of the parking violation by denying that the owner
committed the parking violation or by paying the fine arising out of the
parking violation within thirty (30) days after actual receipt of the parking
ticket charging the violation or, if the owner did not receive the parking
ticket, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notification of violation.
      (2)    Proof that the vehicle was in the care, custody, or control of a
person other than the owner pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement at
the time of the alleged parking violation shall be established by sending a

the parking ticket charging the violation or, if the owner did not receive the
parking ticket, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notification of
violation. The submission of a true copy of a written rental or lease agreement
or affidavit shall be prima-facie evidence that a vehicle was in the care,

another computer readable media in a format acceptable to the Parking
Violations Bureau or Juvenile Court.

the Parking Violations Bureau that the judgment or default judgment described
in subsection (a)(1) of this section or the judgments or default judgments
described in subsection (a)(2) of this section have been paid, dismissed, or
reversed on appeal, or that the initial notice was given in error and is

   In order to facilitate the cleaning of certain streets and to expedite the
free flow of vehicular traffic, motor vehicles shall not be parked on the
streets designated in this chapter at such times as the United States Weather
Bureau records applicable to Marietta, Ohio, indicate that four inches of snow
have fallen or that the same weather bureau records indicate that there is a
certain immediate prospect of a four-inch snowfall within the next eighteen
hours. All cars parked prior to the time of the predicted snowfall must be
removed by the owners or operators thereof and any motor vehicle parked upon
the hereinafter designated streets in violation of this prohibition shall be
removed by order of the Director of Public Safety and Service or by the Chief
of Police. In the event of successive snowfalls, the owners or operators of all
motor vehicles parked in the prohibited areas shall be obligated to remove such
motor vehicles and shall see to it that such motor vehicles remain outside of
the prohibited areas until such time as the snow has stopped and the streets
have been plowed by City snow removal equipment.
(Ord. 18(20-21). Passed 3-5-20.)
   355.02 PURPOSE .
   It is the expressed intention of this chapter to empty all streets
hereinafter designated of all parked motor vehicles so as to allow the speedy
plowing and/or removal of snow from the designated streets without hindrance of
parked motor vehicles.
(Ord. 44 (68-69). Passed 11-21-68. )
   355.03  OWNER OR OPERATOR RESPONSIBILITY.
   It shall be the responsibility of the owners or operators of motor vehicles
to ascertain whether weather conditions require the removal of their motor
vehicles from the streets designated and to remove all cars parked in violation
of the provisions set forth in this section. While the City will make every
effort to inform the public of the existence of weather conditions requiring
removal of parked motor vehicles from the streets designated herein, the owners
and operators of motor vehicles parked in these areas shall have full
responsibility to determine existing weather conditions and to remove parked
motor vehicles if the weather conditions are such as require their removal
under the terms of this chapter.
(Ord. 44 (68-69). Passed 11-21-68.)
   355.04  IMPOUNDING ILLEGALLY PARKED VEHICLES.
   After the United States Weather Bureau records indicate that four inches of

designated in Sections

addition, where a motor vehicle is towed to a motor vehicle pound, the motor
vehicle can be recovered only upon payment of the towing charges imposed.

   355.06  DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION.
   The Police Department shall use all available means of disseminating
information as to the existence of weather conditions requiring removal of
parked motor vehicles from the areas designated. Such notice shall be
disseminated through the radio, newspaper and all other available media to the
extent feasible. The dissemination of this information, however, shall not
relieve owners or operators of motor vehicles from the responsibility of
ascertaining the existence of weather conditions requiring the removal of
parked vehicles from the areas designated.
(Ord. 44 (68-69). Passed 11-21-68. )

commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.

Municipality for purposes of this section.

aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
(1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
(2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to
which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. (ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
   501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
(1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
(2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
(3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   “It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
(1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in conduct
constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct, or
tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
(2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
   501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.

   533.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.
   (c)   "Sexual activity" means sexual conduct or sexual contact, or both.
   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
sexual activity, masturbation, sexual excitement or nudity in a way which tends
to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to
prurient or scatological interest, when the appeal to such interest is
primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.

   541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
(1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
(2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and the
physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to its
former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable cost
of restoring the property.
(3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and the
physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to its
former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal property,
is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind and
quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section

   545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
 545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
   545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions
of Section
545.05 or
545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:
   (a)   A credit card;
   (b)   A printed form for a check or other negotiable instrument, that on its

   (c)   A motor vehicle identification license plate as prescribed by Ohio
R.C. 4503.22, a temporary motor vehicle license registration as prescribed by
Ohio R.C. 4503.182, or any comparable temporary motor vehicle license
registration as prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United

exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must furnish
to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the transient guest, a
certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed the tax applies.

refund the same to the transient guest. Applications shall be filed with the
City Auditor, on the form prescribed by him, within ninety days from the date
it is ascertained that the assessment or payment was illegal or erroneous;
provided, however, that in any event such application for refund must be filed
with the Auditor within four years from the date of the illegal or erroneous
payment of the tax. On filing of such application, the Auditor shall determine
the amount of the refund due and certify such amount to the Treasurer. The

refund as established by ordinance.

due under this chapter and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents. If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the vendor’s
records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale was
exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction if
exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be open
during business hours to the inspection of the City Auditor, and shall be
preserved for a period of four years, unless the Auditor, in writing, consents
to their destruction within that period or by order requires that they be kept
longer.
(Ord. 36 (70-71). Passed 11-5-70.)

Returns shall be filed by mailing the same to the City Treasurer, together with
payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon.
(Ord. 318(08-09). Passed 12-17-09.)
   (b)   The Auditor may authorized vendors whose tax liability is not such as
to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Auditor upon the basis of
administrative costs to the City, to make and file returns at less frequent
intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate the
intervals at which returns are to be filed.
(Ord. 295 (96-97). Passed 11-20-97.)
   (c)   The Treasurer shall stamp or otherwise mark on all returns, the date

immediately transmit all returns filed under this chapter to the Auditor. Any
vendor who fails to timely file a return under this chapter shall forfeit and
pay into the City Treasury, a onetime penalty of two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00). (Ord. 253(22-23). Passed 4-20-23.)

   (a)   If any vendor fails or refuses to collect the transient occupancy tax
or to file a return or remit the tax or any portion thereof as required by this
chapter, the Auditor shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain
information on which to base an assessment of the tax due. When the Auditor has
obtained such information as he is able, he shall proceed to determine and
assess against such vendor the tax and penalty provided for in this chapter.
   (b)   In case such determination is made, the Auditor shall serve notice
upon the vendor of the amount so assessed, either by personal service, or by
registered or certified mail. Such vendor may, within ten days after the
serving or mailing of such notice, apply in writing to the Auditor for a
hearing on the correctness of the amount assessed. If the vendor does not apply
within the time prescribed, the tax and penalty determined by the Auditor shall
become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If the vendor
makes timely application, the Auditor shall give the vendor written notice not
less than five days in advance in the manner prescribed in this section, to
show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified
therein should not be fixed for such tax and penalty. At any such hearing, the
vendor may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax and penalty should
not be so fixed.
   (c)   After such hearing, the Auditor shall determine the proper amount of
tax due and shall thereafter give written notice to the vendor in the manner
prescribed in this section, of such determination and the amount of such tax
and penalty. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen
days.

section does not bar an assessment:

chapter. No vendor shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient guest either
directly or indirectly, any of the tax levied pursuant to this chapter, or make

fails, on two months within a twelve-month period, to file such returns when
due or to pay the tax thereon, the Auditor may require such vendor to furnish
security in an amount equal to the average tax liability of the vendor for a
period of one year, as determined by the Auditor from a review of returns or
other information pertaining to such vendor, which amount shall in no event be
less than one thousand dollars ($1,000). The security may be in the form of an
advance tax payment to be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or
a corporate surety bond, satisfactory to the Auditor, conditioned upon payment
of the tax due with the returns from the vendor. The security must be filed
within ten days following the vendor’s receipt of the notice from the Auditor
of its requirements.
   A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned to the
vendor if, for a period of twenty-four consecutive months following the date
the bond was filed, the vendor has filed all returns and remitted payment
therewith within the time prescribed in this chapter.
(Ord. 81 (88-89). Passed 6-16-88.)

payments, shall be personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer’s or employee’s liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due

   No person shall establish or maintain privies, cesspools and private sewers
on premises in the City accessible to the public sanitary sewers.
   No cesspool or underground receptacle for fill shall be maintained, erected,
built or allowed on any lot or premises abutting on any street in which a
public sewer is laid, but proper water closets, latrines or some means approved
by the Board of Health shall be provided which shall discharge into such sewer.
No such water closets or latrines shall be allowed unless provided with a flow
of water sufficient to wash all filth into the public sewer.
   In streets in which a public sewer shall hereafter be laid, all vaults or
cesspools maintained or existing on such streets, shall, within six months
after the completion of such sewer, be emptied and then filled with fresh
earth, and thereafter shall not be used as a receptacle for filth of any kind.
(1957 Code §16-2)
   921.03 SEWER CONNECTIONS REQUIRED; COMPLIANCE.
   All premises abutting on any street on which a public sewer is laid shall be
connected therewith, and slops, filthy water and liquid wash shall be
discharged into a properly laid pipe leading and emptying into such sewer. Such

by the Superintendent shall not relieve the discharger from the responsibility
to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (b)    Notice. Dischargers shall verbally notify the Chemist/Pretreatment
Coordinator immediately upon the occurrence of a "slug load" or accidental
discharge of substances prohibited by this chapter with a written notification
letter to follow within three workday days. Both notifications shall include
location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and
volume and corrective actions. All slug loads or accidental discharges shall be
sampled and analyzed and the results submitted to the control authority within
fifteen (15) days of the discharge. Any discharger who discharges a slug load
of prohibited materials shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage to the
POTW, in addition to the amount of fines imposed on the authority on account
thereof under State or Federal law.
   (c)   Signs. Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on
discharger's premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug
load or accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may
cause or discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification
procedures.
   (d)    Bypass. If the discharger knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior written notification to the Chemist/Pretreatment
Coordinator, if possible, at least ten days before the date of the bypass.
A discharger shall submit oral notification of an unanticipated bypass to the
POTW immediately upon becoming aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of the time the discharger becomes aware of
the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass
and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times,
and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected
to continue; and the steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass.
Bypass is prohibited, and the City may take enforcement action against an
industrial user for a bypass unless:
      (1)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or
severe property damage.
      (2)    There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
      (3)    The industrial user submitted notices as required by 40CFR 403.17.

which justifies termination of wastewater treatment service, pursuant to
Section
922.11 , the City shall serve or cause to be served upon such discharger, a
written notice either personally or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation. Within ten days
of the date of receipt of the notice, the discharger shall respond in writing
to the City, advising of its position with respect to the allegations.
Thereafter, the parties shall meet to ascertain the veracity of the allegations
and, where necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof.
   (b)   When the Superintendent finds that a User has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this section, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement, the Superintendent may issue orders to the User responsible for
the discharge directing that the User come into compliance within a specified
time. The orders may include a schedule of compliance, a requirement to install
additional treatment, fines, or a combination of these. The orders also may
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. Administrative orders may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement,
nor may an administrative order relieve the User of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation.

   The funds received from the collection of the rates and charges hereinafter
provided shall be deposited as received by the City Treasurer, who shall keep
the same in a separate fund, designated "Sewer Revenue Fund". Subject to the
provisions of any ordinance or indenture of mortgage authorizing the issuance
of and securing mortgage revenue bonds for the system, moneys in the Fund shall

repair and management of the system and for payment of debt charges on bonds
issued for extensions and improvements of the system, and any surplus in the
Fund over and above the requirements hereinbefore mentioned may be used for
enlargements of and replacements to the system and parts thereof.
(1957 Code §16-19)
   923.02  SCHEDULE OF RATES.
   For the purposes provided in Section
923.01, there is hereby levied and charged upon each lot, parcel of land or
premises having a connection with the system or otherwise discharging sewage,
industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly into
the system, or capable of being served by the system, sewer charges payable as
hereinafter provided and in amounts to be determined as follows:
(a)    Water Consumption Charge. Except as hereinafter otherwise provided,
sewer charges at the rates provided in this section, with respect to any
premises, shall be based upon the water consumption charge for the premises for
the billing period applicable to the premises. "Water consumption charge" means
the amount payable or which would be payable for the water consumed upon the
premises and discharged into the system, measured as provided in Section
923.04, during the applicable sewer charge billing period and charged for at
the City water rate applicable to the premises for water service in the City.
(1957 Code §16-20)
(b)    Domestic Sewer Rate. Applicable to all active connections with the
system not falling within the classifications described hereinafter in this
section there shall be a sewer charge based upon water consumption or metered
sewage in 100 cubic foot increments according to the following schedule:
 
 Cubic Feet RatePer 100 Cubic Feet
0 to 3,333       $ .93
3,333 to 16,666  .70
16,666 to 36,666 .63
36,666 to 86,666 .47
Over 86,666      .29
Provided that the minimum sewer charge in any event shall be based upon water
consumption or metered sewage according to the following schedule:
                                                    31 Days to
                                                    Bimonthly

(Ord. 111 (82-83). Passed 3-3-83.)
(c)    Commercial, Industrial and Business Sewer Rate. Applicable to all
commercial, industrial or business establishments regularly employing more than
four persons during the billing period for which the charge is being made;
there shall be a sewer charge based upon water consumption or metered sewage in
100 cubic foot increments according to the schedule provided in subsection (b)
hereof.
(Ord. 96(76-77). Passed 11-22-76.)
(d)    Minimum Rate Apportioned. The minimum rate provided for in subsection
(c) hereof shall be apportioned in the case of any establishment not receiving
sewer service for the entire quarter annual period for which the charge is
being made.
(e)    Surcharge for Acceptable Industrial Waste. In addition to the
commercial, industrial and business rate provided in subsection (c) hereof,
those establishments subject to such classification which are producing
acceptable industrial wastes shall pay a surcharge, based upon the added weight
of suspended solids (SW) and a five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) found
in the sewage from the establishment, which is in excess of normal sewage (NS),
in order to compensate the City for additional capital expenditure and
operating costs imposed by the load received from such establishment. For the
purposes of determining the surcharge provided for by this section, normal
sewage (NS) shall be considered to contain 2,500 pounds per million gallons of
flow or 300 parts per million (ppm) of suspended solids (SW) and 2,000 pounds
per million gallons of flow or 240 parts per million (ppm) of five-day
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). As specified by the Ohio Department of Health,
the percent of treatment to be accomplished by the City's disposal system is
forty-five percent being the removal factor (RF); the amount of flow (F) at the
customer's plant will be measured by the City over twenty-four hour periods, as
cubic feet (CF) or million gallons (MG), with a conversion factor of 133,690 to
translate million gallons to cubic feet. (One part per million gallons is
understood to weigh eight and three hundred forty-five hundredths pounds.)
   The surcharge volume (SV) upon which the surcharge herein provided shall be
based shall be determined by the following formula:
 
(SW-2500) x RF       (BOD - 2000) x RF
SV =                             X                                 X
    2500          2000
             F                 F
The amount of such surcharge shall be five cents (5¢) per SV/100 measured in
cubic feet (CF) as determined for each quarter.
   For the purposes of determining such surcharge the City will make one SW and
BOD analysis and flow determination per calendar year with reference to each
establishment subject hereto. Samples will be composited over twenty-four hours
during a regular operating day, unless the intermittent character of the
plant's output requires longer test periods, as in the case of abattoirs. If
the proprietor of any such establishment so requests, additional flow
measurements and analysis will be made by the City at the proprietor's expense
to be charged for as follows: Fifty dollars ($50.00) per twenty-four hour flow
test. Twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per composite sample analysis. The
proprietor of any establishment producing industrial waste shall install at his
own cost, a suitable manhole in the sewer for the use of the City, and will
provide all common labor necessary to install and operate the sampling
equipment, under the supervision and to the satisfaction of the City, and an
analysis will be made by the City.
(f)    Air Conditioning Rate. On all premises utilizing water produced
otherwise than from the City waterworks system for air conditioning or cooling
purposes, the waste from which process is discharged into the system, an
additional sewer charge shall be made in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00)
per quarter, provided that if the Director of Public Safety and Service shall
determine that the amount of water so discharged is excessive and unduly
burdensome to the system, an increased rate may be established in the manner
provided in Section
923.03. All owners or users of premises employing water produced otherwise than
from the City waterworks system for air conditioning or cooling purposes are
hereby required forthwith to report the same to the Director whenever such
system is in operation or is placed in operation.
   If, in the judgment of the Director of Public Safety and Service, the
discharge from a cooling system is overloading the sewer or plant and the water
is not contaminated by objectionable materials, the Director may require the
owner to dispose of the water in such other way as may be best in the judgement
of the Director.
(g)    Readiness to Serve Charge. Applicable to all premises having an inactive
connection with the system, being premises for which, during a billing period,
no water consumption charge shall accrue; and also to all premises having no
connection with the system but for which a sewer curb connection to the system
has been provided; the fee shall be one dollar ($1.00) per quarter.
(1957 Code §16-20)
(h)    Flat Rate for Users Not Connected to City Water Lines. 
(1)    There is hereby established a flat rate of fifteen dollars ($15.00)
payable bimonthly for utilization of the City sewer lines and treatment
facilities for the disposal of sewage from each user located within the
corporate limits of the City and not connected to City water lines.
(2)    There is hereby established a flat rate of twenty-two dollars and fifty-
five cents ($22.55) payable bimonthly for utilization of the City sewer lines
and treatment facilities for the disposal of sewage from each user located
outside the corporate limits of the City and not connected to City water lines.
(Ord. 112 (82-83). Passed 3-3-83.)
   923.03 BURDENSOME DISCHARGE OF WASTES TO HAVE SPECIFIED ASSESSMENT
   Over and above the rates and charges established by Section
923.02, there may be established, in special instances and upon special
agreement between the City and the owner of any premises served by the system,
such additional charges for industrial wastes of unusual strength or
composition, or for other unduly burdensome discharges into the system which
are accepted by the City for treatment as may be determined to be fair and
equitable. Each such special agreement and the charges established thereby
shall not become effective until ratified by ordinance duly passed by Council.
(1957 Code §16-21)
   923.04 MEASURE USED TO DETERMINE RATES.
   The following measures shall be used to determine sewer charges provided by
Section
923.02 (except with respect to subsection (e) and the air conditioning rate
provided in subsection (f) of such section) upon all premises served by the
system:
(a)    On all premises using water exclusively supplied by the City, water
consumption on the premises shall be measured by water meter acceptable to the
Director of Public Safety and Service.
(b)    On premises using water supplied either in whole or in part from sources
other than the waterworks system of the City, the Director may require the
owner or other interested party to install water meters satisfactory to the
Director to the extent necessary to measure all such supplies of water and the
quantity of water consumed on the premises shall be deemed to be the aggregate
amount disclosed by the meters.
(c)    In the event it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Director with
respect to any premises, that a portion of the water from any source consumed
on the premises does not and cannot enter the system, then in each such case
the owner or other interested party may, at his expense, install and maintain
separate metering devices to the extent necessary to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Director the portion of the water consumed on the premises
which is discharged into the system, which portion shall constitute the basis
for measuring the sewer charge for the premises under Section
923.02.
(1957 Code §16-22)
   923.05 WHEN PAYMENT DUE; PENALTY FOR LATE PAYMENT.
   The sewer charges levied, at the rates established by Section
923.02, shall take effect on July 1, 1954, and shall thereafter be billed and
become payable in the following manner: charges levied with respect to premises
served by the City's waterworks system shall be included in and be payable with
the City's water bill to such premises and shall be billed quarterly, bimonthly
or monthly in accordance with the billing period for City water furnished to
such premises. In respect of premises not served by the City's waterworks
system, such charges shall be billed and payable quarterly, unless, upon
application to the Director of Public Safety and Service, he shall approve a
different billing period for such premises and, in either case, shall be
payable at the same times, respectively, as City water bills are rendered and
become payable. Any premises making connection with the system and using the
same after July 1, 1954, shall be charged a per diem pro rata amount, based
upon the minimum charge, from the time such connection is made or such
discharge into the system is begun, until the commencement of the next
following billing period applicable to the premises, except that should the
measured service exceed the minimum charge, the measured rate shall be charged.
In case of failure to pay any bill for sewer charges when due, a penalty of
five percent of such charges shall be added to such bill.
(1957 Code Sec. 16-23)
   923.06 CHARGES A LIEN; SERVICE DISCONTINUANCE.
   Each sewer charge levied pursuant to this chapter is hereby made a lien upon
the premises charged therewith, and if the same is not paid within thirty days
after it shall be due and payable, it shall be certified to the Auditor of
Washington County, who shall place the same on the tax duplicate, with the
interest and penalties allowed by law, and be collected as other municipal
taxes are collected. The City shall also have the right, in the event of
nonpayment as aforesaid, to discontinue service to such premises of water
supplied by the City's waterworks system, until such unpaid sewer charges have
been fully paid.
(1957 Code §16-24)
   923.07 CITY EXEMPT FROM SEWER CHARGES.
   Except as otherwise provided in any ordinance authorizing an indenture
securing revenue bonds issued for construction of the system or a portion
thereof, no lot, parcel of land, building or premises now or hereafter used by
the City for municipal purposes shall be subject to the sewer charges hereby
established, nor shall any water supplied by the municipal waterworks system
for extinguishing fires, cleaning fire apparatus or furnishing or supplying
water to fire hydrants be used to determine any sewer charge provided in
Section
923.02.

(Ord. 103 (84-85). Passed 9-20-84.)
   924.05 VOLUME OF WASTEWATER.
   (a)    As described in subsequent sections of this chapter, certain segments
of the sanitary sewer charges are determined by applying a unit charge to a
volume of wastewater flow from each user. In all cases, this volume to be
charged for, shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the volume that is recorded
on the meters used to measure water from the water system of the City, unless
the user is supplied with water from a source other than the water system of
the City or unless substantial volume of water supplied to the user is not
discharged to the wastewater treatment works, in which cases, the volume of
water discharged to the wastewater treatment works shall be determined by one
or more meters installed to measure water flow and/or wastewater discharged, or
by other means approved by the City. In the event a sewer user is supplied
either in whole or in part with water from wells or any source other than the
Water Department, then such wells or other source of supply shall be registered
with the Service Director. In the event a sewer user should elect at his own
cost and expense to install a separate meter or meters for registering, or
auxiliary meter for water cooled air conditioners, lawn sprinklers or other
uses which do not return flows to the wastewater treatment works, the volume to
be charged for shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the metered water use and
the rates established in the subsequent sections of this chapter shall apply.
In the event a sewer user shall elect at his own cost and expense to install a
meter to register the exact volume of wastewater that enters the wastewater
treatment works, the volume to be charged for such metered wastewater shall be
based upon one hundred percent (100%) of the actual meter reading and the rates
established in the subsequent sections of this chapter shall apply. Meters
installed other than the meter or meters used to record consumption from the
water system of the City shall be approved by the City and installed and
maintained at the expense of the user.
   (b)    Wastewater meters shall be tested for accuracy at the expense of the
owner once each year by a qualified tester and certified to the City.
   (c)    The City shall have the authority to remove the meter on its
initiative to undertake to test and correct any meter which in its judgment is
registering incorrectly without the consent of the owner. Should the wastewater
meter be found to be registering outside of the accuracy of the specifications
published for such meter, the owner shall bear the cost for shipping, testing,
repair and replacement. Should the wastewater meter be found to be registering
within the accuracy of the specifications published for such meter, the City
shall bear the cost for shipping, testing, repair and replacement. During the
period the meter is not in service, the volume of wastewater discharged shall
be determined by the Service Director.
(Ord. 103 (84-85). Passed 9-20-84.)

   (b)    An industry may be placed in the nonindustrial user class if the
industry discharges primarily segregated domestic wastes or primarily wastes
from sanitary conveniences.
   (c)    Any industry whose wastes are not primarily domestic wastes or not
primarily wastes from sanitary conveniences shall be placed in the industrial
user class.
   (d)    The placement of a user within the nonindustrial user class shall be
as determined by the Service Director in accordance with the above criteria.
(Ord. 103 (84-85). Passed 9-20-84.)
   924.07 USER CHARGES; WASTES OF NORMAL CONCENTRATION.
   (a)    A user charge shall be levied on all users of the wastewater
treatment works to provide funds necessary to pay for the cost of operation,
maintenance and replacement of such works. The user charges shall result in the
distribution of all costs of operation, maintenance and replacement of the
treatment works to each user, or user class, in the proportion to such user’s
contribution to the total wastewater loading of the treatment works. Factors
such as strength, volume and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be
considered and included as the basis for the user's contribution to ensure a
proportional distribution of operation, maintenance and replacement costs. The
method to be used to establish the base user charges for wastewater within
limits of normal concentrations (as defined in Section
924.03) shall be defined in this section. The method to be used to establish
the extra strength surcharge for wastes in excess of normal concentrations
shall be defined in Section
924.09.

      (1)   Within one hundred eighty (180) days of the effective date of this
chapter, or approved by the Water Superintendent, all users of regulated
substance in a wellfield area shall submit an environmental audit
("Environmental Audit") of their facility. The environmental audit will address
the following points:
         A.   A physical description of the facility which will include a site
plan, which at a minimum will clearly define the location and boundaries of the
facility.
         B.   The exact type, amount, physical characteristics and health
effects of any regulated substance used.

The environmental audit will be conducted by an independent, licensed
engineering firm or licensed engineer not employed by the user and qualified to
conduct such investigation. The user may submit an environmental audit
conducted by a licensed engineer employed by the user, who is qualified to
conduct such investigation; provided, however, the Water Superintendent
reserves the right to have an independent environmental audit conducted at the
user's expense. The Water Superintendent will complete his/her review of the
environmental audit and send their comments, if any, within sixty (60) days of
receipt of the environmental audit.
      (2)   Based on the results of the user's environmental audit and/or an
independent audit conducted by the Water Superintendent, the Water
Superintendent will, if appropriate, issue a notice of required corrective
actions ("required corrective action"). The Water Superintendent shall issue
such a notice of required corrective action within six (6) months of his/her
receipt of the environmental audit. If the Director does not issue the required

Superintendent then shall have the burden of proving that such required
corrective action is necessary.
      (3)   The user will have three hundred sixty (360) days after the
issuance of the required action in which to implement the required corrective
action. If the required corrective action has not been implemented within this
time, the Water Superintendent may conduct the remedial work at the user's
expense. Failure to comply with the required corrective action will be subject
to the penalties provided in Section
928.99 hereof. In addition, the facility will be classified as non conforming,
and any future use by the owner or other future owners or users of any portion
of the property will be required to conform as a nonuser of regulated
substances, with the exception being those outlined in subsection (d)(5) of
this section, or in accordance with Section
928.14.
      (4)   If the user has received the prior approval of the Water
Superintendent for the use of the regulated substance or, if the environmental
audit has been submitted or in the process of being submitted in accordance
with this subsection (d) and the regulated corrective action has been completed
or is in the process of being completed in accordance with the required action
plan, the user may use regulated substances at the level approved by the Water
Superintendent or the level in effect at the time this chapter becomes
effective. If the user intends to expand the facility to use additional
quantities and/or types of regulated substances consistent with nature of the
business which was approved by the director or was being conducted at the
facility when this chapter became effective, the user shall submit an
environmental assessment of the estimated effect. The environmental assessment
of estimated effect shall contain:
         A.   Statement of the estimated increase in quantity of regulated
substances being considered, the exact type, amount, physical characteristics
and known human health effects of the regulated substance;
         B.   An assessment of the potential for release of the regulated
substance as the result of any change in the use or approved use and its
potential health effect on the affected population.
Any increase in the quantity or change in the character of an approved or
existing use of the substance will require the environmental assessment of
established effect by the Water Superintendent. The Water Superintendent shall
act on the EAEE within sixty (60) days of its receipt by him/her. If the Water
Superintendent does not act within sixty (60) days, the increase or change in
use shall be deemed denied.

   929.01 PETITION TO COUNCIL FOR EXTENSION OF WATER DISTRIBUTION MAIN.
   When a subdivider, developer, prospective consumer or other person desires
water service where no water distribution mains are available and an extension
of a water distribution main would be required in order to furnish service,
such main pipe extension may be made upon petition directed to Council, subject
to the following terms and conditions:
(a)    Construction by the City.
(1)    Upon receipt of a petition requesting construction by the City of such
main pipe extension within the corporation limits, Council may direct the
Director of Public Safety and Service to prepare plans, specifications and
profiles (in conformity with all applicable State laws, rules and regulations),
determine what easements, if any, are required and estimate the total cost of
such main pipe extension, including the cost of fire hydrants, pumps, service
pipes, appurtenances, etc., together with an estimated cost per new prospective
consumer to be served by such extension and make a report of his findings to
Council.
(2)    Council, if it deems such extension of water mains feasible, may direct
the Director of Public Safety and Service to advertise for bids. After such
bids are open but before a contract is let to the successful bidder, the
subdivider, developer, prospective consumer or other person petitioning for
such extension, or his duly authorized agent, shall deposit with the City a sum
of money equal to the estimated cost of such main pipe extension allocated to,
or charged to the subdivider, developer, prospective consumer or other person
petitioning for such extension in accordance with subsection (a) (3) hereof.
Thereafter, such contract may be let and the work performed in accordance with
the plans, specifications and profiles to the full satisfaction of the Director
of Public Safety and Service.
(3)    The City may extend distribution mains within the corporation, upon
receipt of a water service contract from new consumers to receive service from
such extension, at no cost to the new consumer, a distance of twenty-five
lineal feet per consumer and through any intersection. Where the length of the
required extension is such as to exceed the per consumer distance and the
intersection allowance, the additional cost shall be borne entirely by and be
allocated to the subdivider, developer, prospective consumer or other persons
desiring and petitioning for extension of such water mains.
(Ord. 60(66-67). Passed 8-4-66.)
(4)    (EDITOR'S NOTE: Subsection (a)(4) and the second paragraph of subsection
(a)(3) hereof were repealed by Ordinance 76(78-79), passed August 17, 1978.)
(5)   If, upon completion of the water distribution extension by the City, it
is determined by the Director of Public Safety and Service that the final cost,
including overhead cost, exceeds the estimated sum allocated to and paid by the
subdivider, developer, prospective consumer or other person pursuant to this
subsection, the subdivider, developer, prospective consumer or other person
shall promptly pay the difference, without interest, to the City, and if the
final cost is less than the estimated sum allocated to and paid by the
subdivider, developer, prospective consumer or other person pursuant to
subsection (a)(2) hereof, the City shall promptly refund the difference without
interest.
(b)    Private Construction. 
(1)    When a subdivider, developer, prospective consumer or other person
desirous of such extension of a water distribution main inside the corporation
limits petitions Council for such extension and agrees to bear the full cost
for such extension, including engineering cost, and cost for all necessary
temporary and permanent easements, subsection (a) hereof is inapplicable.
(2)    When a subdivider, developer, prospective consumer or other person
desirous of such extension of a water distribution main outside of the
corporation limits petitions Council for such extension, such extension shall
be made without cost to the City and the entire cost, including engineering
cost, temporary and permanent easements, shall be borne by and allocated to the
subdivider, developer, prospective consumer or other person petitioning for
such extension
(c)    General Provisions Applicable to Construction by City and to Private
Construction. 
(1)    All plans and specifications shall be approved by the Director of Public
Safety and Service prior to construction of water distribution mains, whether
made in or outside the corporation limits, and the mains and all plans and
specifications shall, upon completion of the extensions to the satisfaction of
the Director of Public Safety and Service, be the sole property of the City and
under its exclusive jurisdiction and control.
(2)    Upon completion of the extension of water distribution mains and before
any water shall be supplied to consumers connected to such extension, the
subdivider, developer, prospective consumer or other persons petitioning for
such extensions shall file with the Director of Public Safety and Service a
one-year maintenance bond.
(Ord. 60(66-67). Passed 8-4-66.)
(3)    The size of pipe to be used in making extensions of water distribution
mains shall be determined by the Director of Public Safety and Service in
accordance with the conditions surrounding the extension, including the
possibility of future use and expansion. All pipe shall be cement-lined cast
iron, asbestos cement, material equivalent in design and characteristics, or
approved PVC materials, specifications for which are approved, and are on file
in the office of the Director of Public Safety and Service, a minimum of six
inches in diameter and unless otherwise so stated shall be for a working

   953.01  INDIGENT BURIAL POLICY.
   (a) Purpose. This indigent burial policy is enacted to comply with the
provisions of Ohio R.C. 9.15 pertaining to the burial of indigent persons found
within the City who are not claimed by any person for private interment or
cremation at the person's own expense, or interment or cremation when the body
of an indigent person is claimed by an indigent person. The purpose of this
policy is to provide for the burial of indigents, or the burial of an indigent
person claimed by an indigent person, for reasons of public health and
sensibilities.
   (b) Application of Policy.
    (1)   When the body of a dead person is found within the City and such
person was not an inmate of a correctional, benevolent, or charitable
institution of this State; and the body is not claimed by any person for
private interment or cremation at the person's own expense; or delivered for
the purpose of medical or surgical study or dissection in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 1713.34, the City shall be liable for the cremation and interment
expenses, in the amounts set forth herein, if:
         A.   The deceased is determined to be an indigent person; and,
         B.    The person was a legal resident of the City of Marietta at the
time of death.
      (2)    When the body is claimed by an indigent person simply as that of a
loved one, without undertaking to arrange and pay for private interment, the
City shall be liable for the cremation or interment expenses, in the amounts
set forth herein, if:
         A.    The deceased is determined to be an indigent person; and,
         B.    The person was a legal resident of the City of Marietta at the
time of death; and,
         C.    The claimant is determined to be an indigent person.
   (c) Administration. The Director of Public Safety and Service is hereby
appointed as the proper officer of the City, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 9.15,
to be responsible for the administration of this indigent burial policy. If the
next-of-kin of the deceased are not available or are unknown, the Director of
Public Safety and Service shall have the authority to sign all documents
necessary for the cremation.
   (d) Determining Indigence.
      (1)    Prior to the cremation authorization the Director of Public Safety
and Service shall make reasonable attempt to determine whether the deceased
person is in fact indigent and, where the deceased person is claimed by an
indigent person, whether the claimant is in fact indigent.
      (2)    "Indigent decedent" means a person who dies without leaving an
ascertainable estate sufficient to pay part or all of the person's burial
expenses and whose burial expenses are not payable by the State or County

employment benefits; pensions; annuities; social security; unemployment
compensation, inheritances; number and age of dependents; outstanding debts,
obligations and liabilities; and any other relevant considerations concerning
the financial condition of the individual.

needy, destitute, or in poverty. The criteria for determining whether an
individual is indigent include the ready availability of real or personal
property owned; employment benefits; pensions; annuities; social security;
unemployment compensation, inheritances; number and age of dependents;
outstanding debts, obligations and liabilities; and any other relevant
considerations concerning the financial condition of the individual.
   (e) Determining Legal Residency.
      (1)    Prior to the cremation authorization, the Director of Public
Safety and Service shall make reasonable attempt to determine whether the
deceased person was a legal resident of the City.
      (2)    "Legal Residency" means a physical presence in a particular
location, coupled with the present intent to make that place a permanent
residence for a period of time.
      (3)    In cases where the decedent was living in a nursing home or
hospital located within the City, legal residency shall mean intent to make the
nursing home or hospital a permanent residence.
   (f) Policy.
      (1)    Upon finding that the deceased was a legal resident of the City
and an indigent person, and where the deceased person is claimed by an indigent
person, that the claimant is indigent, the Director of Public Safety and
Service shall authorize the funeral director or other party to cremate the
decedent. (Ord. 241(10-11). Passed 9-5-11.)
      (2)   The City shall dispose of the remains of indigent persons by
cremation only. The City shall pay a maximum of Eight Hundred and Fifty dollars
($850.00) for the cremation and interment of the remains of the deceased. Said
services shall include transportation of the deceased to the funeral home,
necessary supplies and procedures, and a temporary urn for the storage of the
deceased's cremated remains. The City may pay an additional sum, not to exceed
Two Hundred dollars ($200.00), where the services described herein are
performed by a funeral home located outside the City. The Auditor is hereby
authorized to pay such expenses, upon certification from the Director of Public
Safety and Service and receipt of an invoice or bill from the funeral director.
         (Ord. 262(20-21). Passed 9-2-21.)
      (3)    The cremated remains of the deceased may be released to the
decedent's family. If the cremated remains are not claimed, the City may cause
the remains to be buried, and the Auditor is hereby authorized to pay such
expenses, upon certification by the Director of Public Safety and Service and
receipt of an invoice or bill for the burial.
      (4)    The City shall also provide at the grave of the person's cremated
remains, if such remains are buried, a stone or concrete marker on which the
person's name and age, if known, and date of death shall be inscribed.
   (g) Limitations.
       (1)    If the body of an indigent person is claimed by relatives or
friends who arrange for the funeral according to their wishes, the City shall
not pay all or any part of the expenses for the same.
      (2)    The City's Indigent Burial Policy is not supplemental. The funeral
director of funeral home personnel shall not ask for nor accept any funds above
the amounts set forth herein. Upon completion of the cremation, the funeral
director shall submit an itemized bill to the Director of Public Safety and
Service containing the following information:
         A.    Name and age of the deceased;
         B.    Place of burial;
         C.    Services performed;
         D.    Total costs of services;
         E.    Amount received from other sources; and,
         F.    Amount due from the City.
      (3)    The funeral director or funeral home shall reduce the cost to the
City by the amount of funds received from any other source. If additional funds
are paid to the funeral director or funeral home after the City has paid as
herein provided, the City shall be refunded the exact amount of the additional
funds paid to the funeral director or funeral home within thirty days (30) days
of the receipt thereof. The funeral director shall submit a notarized statement
to the Director of Public Safety and Service indicating his understanding and
compliance with the provisions of this Policy.
      (4)    In the event that it is found after the cremation of the deceased
and payment of the cremation and/or burial expenses by the City, that such
indigent decedent and/or indigent claimant had means, assets, insurance or
other benefits or allowances available for the payment of all or part of such
expenses, such proceedings may be taken to recover such costs and expenses as
my be authorized by law.
         (Ord. 241(10-11). Passed 9-5-11.)
   953.02 APPLICATION FOR VETERANS PLOT IN CEMETERY.

953.01 above is a veteran, the Director of Public Safety and Service is
authorized and directed to apply to the Washington County Veterans Service
Commission, or other appropriate agency, for reimbursement to the City for the
cost of the burial plot so provided pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5901.06.

hotel, lodging house, group rental dwelling, or fraternity or sorority house,
do not constitute a functional unit. In determining whether a group of
unrelated persons is a functional unit under the definition set forth above,
the City Engineer shall apply the factors set forth below:
         A.   The following factors shall be prima facie evidence that the
group of persons living together constitutes a functional unit:
            1.   The same group of persons, or a majority of them, has resided
together at a different location for a period of at least six months or at the
present location for at least twelve months; and
            2.   One or two members of the group have executed the lease for
the entire premises, including the entire rental obligation, and there are no
sublease, hold harmless or other written arrangements to pro-rate the rent or
recover the rent from other members of the group.
         B.   The following shall be prima facie evidence that the group of
persons does not constitute a functional unit:
            1.   Individual members of the group have entered into separate
leases for the same premises, or parts thereof, with the obligation under each
lease constituting only a portion of the total periodic rent payment due to the
landlord for occupancy of the premises; and
            2.   The premises are furnished with key-operated locks on
individual rooms or with other means through which one member of the group may
prevent other members of the group from entering her or his room or portion of
the premises when she or he is not physically present (deadbolts, chains or
other locking devices operated only from inside the room shall not be
considered as evidence of the status of the group).
         C.   The following additional factors shall be considered, to the
extent known or applicable, in determining whether the group of persons
constitutes a functional unit:
            1.   Voter registration by a majority of the eligible members of
the group listing the address of the group’s dwelling shall be considered
evidence in support of the proposition that the group is a functional unit.
Voter registration listing other addresses by a majority of the adult members
of the group, or by a majority of those actually registered to vote shall be
considered evidence negating the proposition that the group is a functional
unit.
            2.   Drivers’ licenses held by a majority of the adult members of
the group listing the address of the group’s dwelling shall be considered
evidence in support of the proposition that the group is a functional unit.
Drivers’ licenses listing other addresses by a majority of the adult members of
the group, or by a majority of those actually holding such licenses shall be
considered evidence negating the proposition that the group is a functional
unit.
            3.   The registration of motor vehicles regularly found at the
dwelling listing the address of the group’s dwelling shall be considered
evidence in support of the proposition that the group is a functional unit. The
regular presence at the dwelling of one or more motor vehicles belonging to
members of the group and registered at one or more other addresses shall be
considered evidence negating the proposition that the group is a functional
unit.
            4.   The filing of tax returns by a majority of the members of the
group listing the address of the group’s dwelling shall be considered evidence
in support of the proposition that the group is a functional unit. The filing
of tax returns listing other addresses by members of the group shall be
considered evidence negating the proposition that the group is a functional
unit. Evidence that one or more individuals are claimed as dependents on the
income tax return of individuals not resident in the functional unit shall be
considered evidence that the group is not a functional unit.
            5.   The presence of minor dependent children regularly residing in
the dwelling unit and enrolled in local schools with one or more members of the
group acting in the role of parents (and primary care-givers) shall be
considered a factor tending to support the proposition that the group is a
functional unit.
            6.   Evidence that different residents of the dwelling unit are
away during the summer and that they have several as opposed to a single summer
address shall be considered evidence negating the proposition that the group is
a functional unit.
            7.   Evidence of common acquisition and ownership of furniture and
appliances shall be considered evidence in support of the proposition that the
group is a functional unit.
            8.   Full-time employment of some members of the group in the
general community shall be considered evidence in support of the proposition
that the group is a functional unit.
            9.   Evidence that groceries are purchased and meals regularly
prepared for the group as a whole shall be considered evidence in support of
the proposition that the group is a functional unit. For purposes of this
factor, weekly joint purchases of groceries and the preparation and sharing of
at least seven meals per week shall be considered “regularly prepared.”
               (Ord. 176(06-07). Passed 5-17-07.)
   (o)   Garage:
(1)   “Private garage” means a building accessory to a single-family, two-
family, twin or multiple family dwelling for the storage of motor vehicles
owned and used by the owner or tenant of the lot on which it is erected.
(2)   “Public garage” means a building used for the storage of more than four
motor vehicles. Repairing and servicing of vehicles may be carried on in

enclosed storage areas, not exceeding 500 square feet each, for the storage of

(Ord. 225 (88-89). Passed 7-6-89.)
(p)   “Golf course” means an organized area developed in general conformance to
professional golf association standards.
(q)   Home occupation:
(1)   “Home occupation” means an accessory use which:
A.   Is clearly incidental to or secondary to the residential use of a dwelling
unit or rooming unit; and
B.   Is carried on within a dwelling unit, rooming unit or accessory building
unit, except that, only one person not residing in such dwelling unit or
rooming unit may be employed; and
(Ord. 81(66-67). Passed 12-15-66.)
C.   Occupies not more than twenty-five percent of the total floor area of such
dwelling unit or rooming unit and in no event more than 500 square feet of
floor area, except that in an instance where the home occupation-is a bed and
breakfast accommodation, the Planning Commission shall be and is hereby given
the full and complete authority to determine whether or not a bed and breakfast
accommodation may exceed the square foot limitation and, if it so determines,
the Planning Commission may at its discretion issue a special permit approving

themselves and not to allow the location of trailer parks or house trailer home
sites in any commercial or any industrial zoned areas, except that the Planning
Commission shall be and is hereby given the full and complete authority to
determine whether or not the location of a trailer park or single mobile home
in a commercial or industrial zoned area would, in fact, benefit the
neighborhood area in terms of being the highest and best use for the already
established land utilization in the neighborhood area. The manner of bringing
this subject before the Planning Commission shall be the same in all respects
as the procedures required for variance already established under the Zoning
Ordinance. This amendment shall apply only to that part of Chapter
1115 dealing exclusively with mobile homes and mobile home parks and shall not

hamper the development of concentrations of local retailing areas. The
permitted services create few objectionable influences on nearby residential
areas.

   1136.04 USE REGULATIONS.
    The following use regulations shall apply to cellular or wireless
communication antennas and towers;
   (a)   A cellular or wireless communications site may be permitted in
business or industrial zoning districts only subject to the requirement set
forth therein.
   (b)   Cellular or wireless communication sites in a business or industrial
zoning district shall not be located any closer to any residential area than as
follows:
Shall not be located any closer than 300 feet to any residential area. Any
persons locating an antenna on City facilities shall be exempt from this
requirement.
   (c)   A cellular or wireless communications antenna may be mounted to an
existing structure, such as a communications tower (whether said tower is for
cellular or wireless purposes or not), smoke stack, water towers or other tall
structures in business or industrial zoning districts if a permit has been
granted. Cellular or wireless communication antenna placed on the top of
buildings must be less than 35 feet in height.
   (d)   Micro antennas not exceeding 35 feet in height may be placed on any
building in a business or industrial zoning district. A micro antenna may be
attached to any existing building located in an area described in the preceding
sentence, and shall not be subject to the setback requirement of other cellular
or wireless communication towers provided it is placed on the roof of an
existing building.
   (e)   All other uses accessory to the cellular or wireless communication
antennas and towers including, but not limited to business office, maintenance
depots, and materials and vehicle storage, are prohibited from the site unless
otherwise permitted in the zoning district in which the cellular or Wireless
communications antenna and/or tower is located.
      (Ord. 331(16-17). Passed 12-21-17.)
   1136.05 STANDARDS OF APPROVAL OF ALL CELLULAR OR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
ANTENNAS AND TOWERS.
   The following standards shall apply to all cellular or wireless
communications antennas and towers submitting application to the City
assignees:
   (a)   The person shall demonstrate, using the latest technological evidence,
why the antenna or tower must be placed in a proposed location in order to
serve its necessary function in the company's grid system. Part of the
demonstration shall include a drawing showing the boundaries of the area around
the proposed location which would probably also permit the antenna to function
properly in the company's grid system. The area shall be considered the
allowable zone.
   (b)   If the person proposes to build a cellular or wireless communications
tower (as opposed to mounting the antenna on an existing structure), the person
is required to demonstrate that the person has contracted the owners of nearby
tall structures within the zoned district, asked for permission to install the
cellular communications antenna on those structures, and was denied for either
non-economic reasons or that a clearly unreasonable economic demand was made by
the owner, based on prevailing market values. "Tall Structures" shall include,
but not be limited to: smoke stacks, water towers, buildings over 35 feet in
height, antenna supporting structures or other cellular or wireless
communication companies, other communication towers. The City may deny the
application to construct a new cellular or wireless communication tower if the
applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount the antenna on an existing
structure. All antennas and towers must be designed to withstand wind speeds of
at least one hundred (100) miles per hour.
   (c)   The applicant shall demonstrate that the antenna/tower is no higher
than necessary to function satisfactorily and to accommodate the co-location
requirement. No antenna that is taller than the necessary height shall be
approved. Cellular or wireless towers shall be monopole construction unless it
is demonstrated that another type of tower is required for safety purposes.
   (d)   If a new cellular or wireless tower is to be constructed in an
industrial zoned district, the minimum distance between the base of the tower
or any guy wire anchors and any property line which abuts a zoning district
other than a residential area shall be no closer than the greater of the
following:
      (1)   40% of the tower height
      (2)   50 feet of the property line.
   (e)   (1)    All cellular or wireless communications towers shall be fitted
with anti-climbing devices as approved by the manufactures. The person applying
shall demonstrate that the proposed cellular or wireless communication tower
and its antenna are safe and that the surrounding properties will not be
negatively affected by tower failure, falling ice, or other debris,
electromagnetic fields or radio frequency interference. However, if a specific
safety issue in question is determined to be regulated by either FCC
regulations or applicable Building code regulations, and the operation or
construction is in compliance with such regulations, then this requirement for
safety shall be deemed to have been met.
      (2)    If the installation and/or the operation of the cellular or
wireless communication tower site is determined by City Council, upon
presentation of proper and sufficient documentation; and after a public
hearing, that the operation of a cellular or wireless communications tower is
inherently dangerous or is a demonstrable health hazard, the cellular or
wireless tower shall be declared to be a nuisance and all operation shall
cease.
   (f)   An enclosed secured chain link fence shall be required around the
cellular or wireless communication tower and its support structure(s) unless
the antenna is mounted on an existing structure. The enclosed chain link fence
shall be a minimum of eight feet in height and shall be painted forest green
and maintained yearly for appropriate upkeep to city standards evaluated by
City Safety Service Director at the time of the annual City Regulations
submittal.
   (g)   Landscaping in compliance with a plan approval by the City Safety
Service Director shall be provided to screen as much of the support structure
and ground level features as possible and such landscaping shall be maintained
and is subject to annual review during the Annual Registration Process, January
I of each year. In addition, existing vegetation (such as trees and bushes) on
and around the site shall be preserved to the greatest extent possible.
      (Ord. 331(16-17). Passed 12-21-17.)
   1136.06 CO-LOCATION OF CELLULAR AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATION TOWERS.
   (a)   In order to reduce the number of antenna support structures needed in
the City in the future, the owner of an existing cellular or wireless
communications tower shall not unreasonably deny a request to accommodate other
uses, including other cellular or wireless communication companies, and the
antenna of local police, fire and EMS department needs. The owner of the
existing cellular or wireless communications tower may request reasonable
compensation for the use of the tower.
   (b)   For the purpose of encouraging co-location of cellular and wireless
antenna and other uses, cellular or wireless communication towers shall be
designed, engineered, and constructed as follows, unless waived for good cause
to minimize impact on adjoining property by the Mayor and City Safety Service
Director.
      (1)   Towers less than 75 feet tall shall be designed, engineered and
constructed to handle one or more cellular or wireless communications service
users;
      (2)   Towers more than 75 feet in height but less than 150 feet shall be
designed, engineered and constructed to support antennas installed by two or
more wireless communication service users; and
      (3)   Towers 150 feet in height or taller shall be designed, engineered
and constructed to support antennas installed by three or more cellular or
wireless communications service users.
   (c)   As used in the above three points, the term USERS shall include the
antennas of police, fire and EMS departments. These governmental entities shall
not be considered "users" until their respective telecommunications antennas
and equipment are placed on the tower and a fee agreement for carriage has been
negotiated and approved by City Council. In addition, an applicant must
demonstrate that the area acquired for the use and construction of the cellular
tower and accessory structures is sufficient in size to accommodate any
additional structures that may be required if additional users are added to the
tower.
(Ord. 331(16-17). Passed 12-21-17.)
   1136.07 MAINTENANCE AND TOWER OPERATIONAL STANDARDS.
   (a)   The person applying to the City must demonstrate that the person is
licensed by the FCC. The owner of the tower must also annually provide at the
January 1 Registration process each year, a list of all users with addresses,
names and phone numbers of responsible management personnel of the tower. Each
user shall provide the City with a copy of each user license with the FCC. No
approval will be granted to any application unless proof of current FCC license
for proposed use of the tower is provided.
   (b)   Adequate parking shall be required for users of the tower such as
maintenance personnel. If the site is not fully automated, the number of
required parking spaces shall equal the number of employees working on the
largest shift.
   (c)   Cellular or wireless communications towers under 200 feet in height
shall be painted silver or have a galvanized finish retained in order to reduce
visual impact. Any cellular or wireless communication tower shall meet all
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. No cellular or wireless
communication tower may be artificially lighted except when required by the
FAA. No signage is allowable on cellular or wireless communication tower or
antenna or accessory buildings and structures. All utility lines serving the
towers shall be underground.
   (d)   The owners of property used as a cellular or wireless communications
site shall maintain such property and all structures in good condition and free
of trash, outdoor storage, weeds and other debris. Any owner of a cellular or
wireless communication tower shall be required to notify the Mayor and Safety
Service City Engineer of its intent in writing within 30 days of its cessation
of business, its discontinuance of service, or any transfer merger or
acquisition of ownership.
(Ord. 331(16-17). Passed 12-21-17.)
   1136.08 ABANDONMENT OF TOWERS, ANTENNAS AND FACILITIES.
   (a)   (1)    Upon abandonment of towers and antennas by person providing
tower, any person providing a tower shall present a report to the City Safety
Service Director, or his designee, notifying them of any tower facility located
in the City whose use will be discontinued for 120 days. The City Safety
Service Director may then declare the facility abandoned. (This excludes any
dormancy period between construction and the initial use of the facility.)
Discontinued shall mean that the structure has not been properly maintained,
has been abandoned, become obsolete, is unused or has ceased the daily
activities or operations which has occurred. The facility's owner/operator will
receive written notice from the City Law Director and City Safety Service
Director, and be instructed to either reactivate the facility's use within 120
days or dismantle and remove the facility. If re-activation or dismantling does
not occur, the City will remove or will contract to have removed the facility
and assess the owner/operator the costs.
      (2)    The City must provide the person owning the tower three months'
notice to be heard before the Planning Commission before initiating such
action. After such notice has been provided, the City shall have the authority
to initiate proceedings to either acquire the tower and any appurtenances
attached thereto at the then fair market value, or in the alternative, order
the demolition of the tower and all appurtenances.
      (3)   The City shall provide the tower owner with the right to a public
hearing and shall follow the three month notice required in the above mentioned
paragraph. All interested parties shall be allowed an opportunity to be heard
at the public hearing.
      (4)    After a public hearing is held, the Planning Commission shall make
its recommendation to City Council, at which time City Council, may order the
acquisition or demolition of the tower. The City will require tower applicants
to pay for all expenses necessary to acquire or demolish the tower.
   (b)   No cellular or wireless communication tower shall be constructed,
replaced or altered without obtaining the applicable building permit from the
City of Marietta and State of Ohio.

   1137.02 POWERS.
   The Planning Commission shall have the following powers, in addition to
those prescribed by the Ohio Revised Code.
(a)    Appeals. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error
in any order requirement, decision or determination made by the City Engineer
in the enforcement of this Zoning Ordinance, including but not limited to the
imposition of building and zoning penalties levied by him.
(Ord. 280(00-01). Passed 12-6-01.)
(b)   Special Exceptions. To authorize, upon application, special exceptions to
the terms of this Zoning Ordinance in such cases as are herein expressly
provided for, in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Zoning
Ordinance, and the provisions thereof. Wherever in this Zoning Ordinance the
specific conditions and safeguards are prescribed for the granting of special
exceptions, the Planning Commission shall have the power to impose such
additional conditions and safeguards as may be appropriate.
(c)   Variances.  
(1)   To authorize upon appeal, in specific cases, such variances from the
terms of this Zoning Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest,
where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
this Zoning Ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship solely through the
manner of operation of this Zoning Ordinance upon the particular property in
question, and so that the spirit of this Zoning Ordinance will be observed and
substantial justice done.
A.    The Planning Commission may grant temporary and conditional variances for
periods not to exceed one year.
B.    Without limiting the reasons for granting a variance, a variance may be
granted to permit such modifications of the lot dimensions and lot area
regulations, or the front, rear and side yard regulations, as may be necessary
to secure appropriate improvement of a zoning lot which is of such topography
or restricted area that it cannot be appropriately improved without such
modifications.
(2)    In granting a variance the Planning Commission may impose appropriate
conditions and safeguards.
(3)    In granting a variance the Planning Commission must find that the
granting of the variance will not materially adversely affect the health or
safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the proposed use
and will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to
property or improvements in such neighborhood.
(4)    In exercising the abovementioned powers, the Planning Commission may
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify, the order, requirements,
decision or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirements,
decision or determination as ought to be made. Notification of such decision
shall forthwith be given to all parties in interest.
(5)    Every such variance granted by the Planning Commission shall be
accompanied by a finding of fact specifying the reasons for the granting of
such variation.

1138.08   Fees.
   1138.01 INTENT.
   (a)   It is the intent of this chapter to provide appropriate locations and
reasonable restrictions for the cultivation and transfer of marijuana allowed
by the Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program. This is a unique land use with
ramifications not addressed by more traditional zoning district and home
occupation regulations. Although some specific uses of marijuana are allowed by
the Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program, marijuana continues to be
classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance under Federal law making it
unlawful under Federal law to use, manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or
possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense marijuana.
   (b)   It is the intent of this chapter to protect the health, safety, and
general welfare of persons and property by limiting land uses related to
marijuana to districts that are compatible with such uses. Additional
regulations in this chapter are intended to provide reasonable restrictions
within districts so that these uses do not compromise the health, safety, and
general welfare of persons in the district, or other uses allowed in each
district.
(Ord. 310(20-21). Passed 12-16-21.)
   1138.02 DEFINITIONS.
   The following words and phrases shall have the following definitions when
used in this section.
   (a)    Words and phrases contained in the Ohio Medical Marijuana Control
Program ("OMMCP"), HB523. This subsection contains some words and phrases that
are defined in the OMMCP. As used in this section, they have the same meaning
as provided in the OMMCP, except that if at any time the definition of a word

   1143.09  DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The standards and details of design herein contained are intended only as
minimum requirements so that the general arrangements and layout of a
subdivision may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances. However, in the
design and development of a plat the subdivider should use standards consistent
with the site conditions so as to assure an economical, pleasant and durable
neighborhood.
   The final plans and specifications of improvements shall be a set of
construction and utility plans prepared by a registered professional engineer.
The plans shall include typical sections, plans and profile views, construction
details and estimate of quantities. All typical sections and major engineering
details to be used on any particular street shall be approved in advance by the
City Engineer and prior to the granting of approval of the final plat the
subdivider shall have installed the required improvements or have posted a bond
or other surety.
(a)    Conformity with the Approved City Thoroughfare Plan. The arrangement,
character, extent, width and location of major, secondary, and minor streets or
highways shall conform with the Official Thoroughfare Plan for the City, and
with provisions of these regulations. Streets not contained in the Official
Thoroughfare Plan should conform to the recommendation of the Planning
Commission based on existing and planned streets, topography, public safety,
convenience and proposed uses of land.
(1)    Construction of streets and alleys shall be in accordance with the
latest edition of the State of Ohio, Department of Transportation’s Location
and Design Manuals and Construction and Materials Specifications.
(b)    Arrangement and Alignment. Residential streets shall be designed to
discourage through traffic which may otherwise use secondary and major highways
and whose origin and destination are not within the subdivision. Reserve strips
controlling access to streets shall be prohibited, except where their control
is definitely placed in the City under conditions approved by the Planning
Commission. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided.
(1)    Arrangement. Where a railroad crossing is involved, the plan of the
subdivision shall be considered in its relation to the probability of grade
separation or other treatment and may be required to conform to certain
conditions in anticipation of such treatment. Where the subdivision adjoins a
railroad right-of-way, and zoning plans or other conditions indicate that such
property shall be used for industrial purposes, highways in the same general
direction as the railroad shall be as nearly parallel to such railroad right-
of-way as may be practicable.
(2)    Alignment.
         A.    Vertical. For main thoroughfare, profile grades shall be
connected by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent to thirty times the
algebraic difference between the rates of grade, expressed in feet per hundred;
for secondary and minor streets twenty times, and ten times for alleys.
1.    Grade at intersections. Approaches to intersections shall be reduced to a
grade not to exceed three percent (3%) for a minimum distance of ninety feet
from the curb, unless otherwise approved by the City Planning Commission.

highway, the Commission shall seek information from the Ohio Department of
Transportation, as to the status of the highway in reference to width and
direction.
(d)    Cul-de-sacs. The maximum length of a cul-de-sac shall be 1500 feet,
except where unavoidable. Each cul-de-sac shall be provided with a turnaround
facing a minimum right-of-way radius of forty-five feet. The road surface
within the cul-de-sac right-of-way shall have a radius of thirty feet.
(e)    Intersections. Streets shall intersect one another at an angle as near
to a right angle as possible. The property line of street intersections shall
be rounded with a radius of fifteen feet when the intersection occurs at right
angles. If an intersection occurs at an angle other than a right angle, it
shall be rounded with a curve or a radius acceptable to the Commission. Curb
radius at intersections shall be rounded with a curve of twenty-five feet or
larger as directed by the Engineer.
(f)    Width and Pavement. Unless otherwise approved by the Planning

   1143.11 GRADING AND DRAINAGE PLANS REQUIRED.
   (a)    Grading and drainage plans shall be submitted with each application
for a development permit. The results of all hydrologic and hydraulic studies
including the 100 Year Flood Contour Elevation shall be clearly shown on all
site plans where applicable. In addition, a soil investigation report to
evaluate possible drainage and erosion problems may be required at the option
of the City Engineer where he feels that unstable slopes or other site
conditions warrant such study.
   (b)    All lots shall be graded in such a manner that storm water shall
drain therefrom and there shall not be any undrained depressions. Grading shall
be accomplished in such a manner that it shall not obstruct the natural
drainage of adjoining and adjacent properties to the subdivision.
   (c)    Wherever possible, with exceptions being made where the topography of
an area does not permit such grading practice, or where other drainage ways are
provided, lots shall be graded from the rear lot line to the street. Where a
lot abuts directly on two streets, the grade shall be from the corner of the
lot which is diagonally opposed to the corner of the two streets on which the
lot abuts. This regulation is included in a desire to reduce the amount of
water standing in yards to minimum. Therefore, where it is not possible to
grade a lot in the prescribed manner, the owner or developer shall provide for
the adequate drainage of any and all low areas and tie such drainage into and
make it a part of the storm sewer of the development and the City, as directed
by the City Engineer, with approval of such drainage subject to inspection by
the City Engineer, along with the inspection of other storm sewer installation.

   (b)   Development to Affect Stream Channel. Whenever a development is
proposed that will affect one or more stream channels, the developer shall
submit a Land Development Plan that describes the proposed effect on the
channel and the flow of water in the channel and demonstrates how such effect
will be compensated for.
   (c)    Development Area Disturbing One Acre or More or Within A Common Plan
of Development. Whenever a proposed development area consists of one acre or
more, and earth disturbing activities are proposed for the whole area or any
part thereof, the developer shall submit a plan prepared and certified by a
Professional Civil Engineer for slope stability maintenance, for water quality,
management, and for erosion and sediment pollution control.

Marietta as being necessary to assure compliance with the provisions of this
Title. The amount of the bond shall be determined by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 279(22-23). Passed 6-15-23.)
   1153.08  INSPECTION TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE.
   The City Engineer or his/her representative has the authority to enter into
and inspect all development areas, in order to determine compliance with these
regulations. If the City Engineer or his/her representative determines that a
violation of these regulations exists, the property owner or his representative
shall be notified of the deficiencies or noncompliance by means of certified
mail, personal service or by any other means as deemed sufficient by the City
Engineer. Such notification shall describe the deficiency or noncompliance and
shall specify a date by which compliance shall be accomplished. If the
noncompliance pertains to land development that is underway, the City Engineer
may also issue to the property owner or
his representative a written order to cease and desist the development.
(Ord. 279(22-23). Passed 6-15-23.)
   1153.09 APPEALS.
   (a)   Where circumstances are exceptional and justice requires the City
Planning Commission shall have the power to authorize such variances from the
terms, provisions, or requirements of these regulations as will not be contrary
to the public interest. Such variances shall be authorized only where the
Planning Commission explicitly finds, beyond reasonable doubt that each of the
following facts and conditions exists:
(1)   “Practical difficulty or undue hardship”. Because of exceptional or
extraordinary conditions pertaining to a specific piece of property, a literal
enforcement of these regulations will result in practical difficulty or undue
hardship that is unnecessary to the achievement of public purposes.
(2)   “Exceptional circumstances”. The exceptional or extraordinary conditions
that occasion the request for a variance are peculiar to the property in
question and are not applicable generally to other properties of the same
landslip potential or size category.
(3)   “Equal rights”. Granting of the requested variance will not confer on the
appellant any special privilege that is denied to other properties in the same
landslip potential or size category, while literal interpretation of these
regulations would deprive the appellant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties of the same landslip potential or size category.
(4)   “Minimum variance”. The variance granted is the minimum variance required
to make possible the reasonable development of the land.
(5)   “Absence of detriment”. The authorizing of such variance will not result
in substantial detriment to the property being developed or to other properties
and will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of these regulations
and with the public interest.
(6)   “Not of a general nature”. The special condition of the property that
creates the hardship or difficulty is specific to that property and is not of
so general or recurrent a nature within the jurisdiction of the City of
Marietta as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general
regulation to apply to such condition or situation.
   (b)   A petition for a variance shall include all of the material required
in Section
1153.05 “Plan Content” as well as a written statement in the terms of paragraph
(a) of this Section of the reasons for requesting a variance. Such petition
shall be filed with the City Planning Commission, which shall fix a reasonable
time for a hearing, shall give thirty (30) days public notice, as well as
written notice to owners of adjacent properties. Where the request for variance
involves any alteration of a watercourse or stream or the flow of water
therein, written notice shall also be conveyed to the owners of the three (3)
next lower riparian properties under wholly different ownership. Each petition
shall be accompanied by a fifty dollar ($50.00) fee payable in cash or by check
to the City of Marietta. At the hearing, any person may appear in person or be
represented by authorized agent or attorney. Such agents or attorneys shall
present competent evidence of the extent of their authorization. All witnesses
shall testify under oath. The Planning Commission shall decide the request
within 45 days following the hearing.
(Ord. 114(00-01). Passed 9-21-00.)
   (c)   In authorizing a variance, the City Planning Commission may attach
thereto such conditions regarding the location, character, and other features
of the proposed developments as it may deem necessary in the furtherance of the
purposes of these regulations and in the public interest. If the Planning
Commission attaches conditions to a variance, it may request the City Engineer
to require such evidence, guarantee, bond, surety, or security as he may deem
necessary to enforce compliance with such conditions.
   (d)   Should a variance be granted there shall be a twenty dollar ($20.00)
fee payable in cash or by check to the City of Marietta for the issuance of a
Certificate of Variance.
   (e)   In exercising its power, the Planning Commission may, in conformity
with the provisions of statute and of these regulations, reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the variance and or its conditions,
requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and may make such order,
requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end
shall have all the powers of the office from whom the appeal is taken.
   (f)   Any person or persons, jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision
of the City Planning Commission with respect to the granting or denial of a
variance requested under this section, or any taxpayer, may present to the
Court of Common Pleas of Washington County a petition, duly verified, setting
forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, and specifying the
grounds of illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the Court within
thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision with the Clerk of the City
Planning Commission.
(Ord. 246(98-99). Passed 12-31-99.)
   1153.10 VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES AND REMEDIES.
   (a)    Violation of the provisions of this Title or failure to comply with
any of its requirements shall constitute a minor misdemeanor for the first five
(5) days that such violation exists. The court of competent jurisdiction may
levy a fine of up to one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) per day for each day
thereafter that the violation exists. Each day such violation continues shall
be considered a separate offense.
   (b)    If violations are not abated in thirty (30) calendar days, the City
may abate violation(s) and/or restoration affected property(ies) in accordance
with Sections
 1156.19(d) and
1156.20.
   (c)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Marietta from
taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. Any Developer who receives a Notice of Violation for any project in
the City is excluded from participating in future City contracts until the
violation has been corrected.
   (d)   Individuals or firms who are involved with projects that violate the
requirements of Land Development Ordinances may be excluded from performing
design and/or inspection of projects within the City.

   (b)   No new development shall be undertaken except in compliance with the
standards and criteria set forth in this Title.
(Ord. 280(22-23). Passed 6-15-23.)
   1154.02 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.
   All development shall be planned and executed so as to:
   (a)   Avoid unnecessary earth-disturbing activity;
   (b)   Be fitted to the terrain in such a way as to preserve natural
topographic features and vegetative cover insofar as possible and to minimize
change to existing contours;

   1154.03 SLOPE DESIGN AND GRADING REQUIREMENTS.
   When determining appropriate grading and sloping stabilization measures,
consideration shall be given to length and steepness of slope, soil type,
unsloped drainage area, groundwater conditions and proposed land use. Technical
standards and specifications for measures to be taken to meet the following
criteria are found in the current version of the EPA NPDES General Permit For
Construction Site Storm water and Rainwater and Land Development: Ohio 's
Standards for Stormwater Management, Land Development and Urban Stream
Protection.
   (a)   Unstable Lands. Wherever the geologic stability of natural or man-made
slopes may be threatened by new development, the developer shall take
protective measures, including but not limited to retention structures and/or
the setbacks described in Section
 1154.03(b)(3), to stabilize such slopes both within and, with the approval of
the appropriate landowner, outside of the development area, in order to protect
the public health, safety, and welfare.
Lands identified by the City of Marietta as having a medium or high landslip/
soil slippage potential shall not be graded, excavated, or filled or have loads
imposed upon them unless the work is done in accordance with a stability
analysis and development plan prepared and certified by a Registered
Professional Engineer, as prescribed in Section
1153.05 "Plan Contents"
   (b)   Cut and Fill Slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed,
constructed, and maintained in a manner that will maximize stability and
minimize erosion. Consideration shall be given to length and steepness of
slope, soil type unslope drainage area, and groundwater conditions when
determining appropriate drainage management and slope stabilization measures.
The following standards and specifications are in addition to those stated in
the current version of Rainwater and Land Development: Ohio’s Standards for
Stormwater Management, Land Development and Urban Stream Protection.
      (1)   Rock or similar irreducible material with a maximum dimension
greater than eight (8) inches, organic materials, and construction and
demolition debris shall be prohibited from fills, unless such fills are
intended and approved by the City as mass rock fills or disposal fills.
      (2)   Fills shall be compacted to a density that is appropriate for the
intended use. That density shall be determined by laboratory analysis of the
fill material prior to its placement. Field density shall be determined by a
recognized standard procedure as approved by the City Engineer. Results of any
required laboratory and field density analyses shall be filed with the City;
and
      (3)   The horizontal distance from the top and from the toe of an
existing or proposed unrestrained cut or fill slope to the nearest existing or
proposed structure, property line, or paved surface shall be at least one-half
(½) the vertical height of the cut or fill, unless the City Engineer shall
approve a different distance as appropriate based upon local geology or
character of materials. (See Section
1155.02, Figure 1.)
      (4)   There shall be a minimum two percent (2%) surface grade from all
buildings.
         (Ord. 280(22-23). Passed 6-15-23.)
   1154.04 WATER MANAGEMENT.
   All development shall include provision for safe and efficient removal of
surface and subsurface waters from the site. Technical standards and
specifications for measures to be taken to meet the following criteria are
found in the current version of the EPA NPDES General Permit For Construction
Site Stormwater and Rainwater and Land Development: Ohio's Standards for
Stormwater Management, Land Development and Urban Stream
Protection.
   (a)   Drainageways to Remain Clear of Obstruction. Except for stormwater
control facilities approved by the City, no new temporary or permanent
structure to fill and no storage of materials or equipment (other than
watercraft) shall be permitted within the channels or floodways of permanent or
intermittent streams, drainage ditches, or any other drainage facility or
system, unless the developer submits an engineering analysis that demonstrates:
      (1)   That such development will not impair the capacity of such facility
or system, either by itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by
flowing water.
      (2)   That such structures, materials, or equipment will not be subject
to damage by flowing water or materials carried by flowing water at velocities
likely to be encountered during floods; and,
      (3)   That no such structure or material or equipment shall be
susceptible to being entrained and transported by flowing water, thereby to
pose a threat to downstream property.
   (b)   Ponds Less Than 4,000 Square Feet. Ponds with a surface area less than
4000 square feet are exempt from the prohibitions in Section
 1154.02. Ponds with surface area greater than 4000 square feet are exempt from
the prohibitions of Section
1154.02 provided the design is inspected and approved by the City Engineer.
   (c)   Disposal of Stormwater. All drainage facilities shall be designed and
maintained to carry surface and/or subsurface waters to the nearest practical
storm drain or natural watercourse approved by the City as a safe place to
deposit such waters. Concentrated stormwater shall not be allowed to flow down
the face of a slope unless it is contained within an adequate channel, flume,
or slope drain structure with approved energy dissipation. The grade of
drainage facilities shall be sufficient to maintain sediment in suspension.
   (d)   Stormwater Structures to be Related to Downstream Discharge
Facilities. Stormwater retention and detention structures and drainage
facilities shall be designed and maintained so as not to overload downstream
discharge facilities.
   (e)   Erosion and Flood Control in Outfalls and Channels. Storm outfalls and
constructed or modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand
the expected velocity of flow from a post development, twenty-five-year
frequency, 24-hour duration storm without eroding or flooding. Where such
conduits may cross unstable slopes or slopes capable of becoming unstable with
the addition of significant water, the conduits shall be lined with a water-
   resistant material.
   (f)    Storm water Control for Development Areas Disturbing One Acre or More
or Within a Common Plan of Development. Shall meet the requirements for earth
disturbed area (EDA) as described in the current edition of the EPA NPDES
General Permit For Construction Site Stormwater. To control stream channel
erosion and sediment pollution caused by increased storm water runoff rates and
volumes, storm water rnnoff from development areas shall be restricted so that
development does not increase peak runoff rates so that any increase in runoff
volume consequent to development is compensated for by a reduction in runoff
rates, as follows:
      (1)   Development shall not increase rate of runoff. The peak rates of
runoff from any area following development shall be no greater than the peak
rates of runoff from equivalent-size storms in the same area prior to that
development for all twenty-four (24) hour storms from one-to-one-hundred-year
frequency. Design and development to match the peak rate of runoff for the
one-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year storms shall be
considered adequate to meet this standard.
      (2)   Increase in volume of runoff requires reduction in rate of runoff.
If the volume of runoff from an area is projected to be greater after
development than before development, the volume increase shall be compensated
for by reducing the peak rate of runoff from the critical storm and all more
frequent storms occurring on the development area to the peak rate of runoff
from a one-year-frequency, twenty-four-hour storm occurring on the same area
under pre-development conditions.
         For storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than
the critical storm, up to the one-hundred-year storm, development need only
comply with paragraph (f)(1) above.
         The critical storm for a specific development area is determined as
follows:
         A.   Calculate the total volumes of runoff from a one-year-frequency,
twenty-four hour storm occurring on the development area both before and after
development.
         B.   From the volumes calculated in paragraph (2)A. above, calculate
the percent increase in volume of runoff that will result from the proposed
development. Using this percentage, select the appropriate critical storm from
the following table:
            Percentage Increase in      “Critical Storm”
             Volume of Runoff         Discharge Limitation
            (at least)   (but less than)
   00   10   1 year
   10   20   2 years
   20   50   5 years
   50   100   10 years
   100   250   25 years
   250   500   50 years
   500 (or more)      100 years
      (3)   Points at which runoff is to be calculated. The requirements of
this Section for runoff rates and volumes shall be satisfied at each location
where runoff leaves the development area.
      (4)    Points at which runoff is to be calculated. The requirements of
this Section for runoff rates and volumes shall be satisfied at each location
where runoff leaves the development area.
      (5)    Access easements. Permanent access and access easements, a minimum
of 20-feet wide, shall be provided to allow inspection and maintenance of
stormwater control structures and stormwater conveyance systems.
   (g)    Drainage Facility Design. Where a development area is large enough to
require the preparation of a drainage analysis, all drainage facilities shall
be designed by a professional engineer in accordance with their commendations
of that analysis.
      (Ord. 280(22-23). Passed 6-15-23.)
   1154.05 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL.
   The potential for sediment pollution of water resources shall be addressed
both by minimizing erosion at the development site and by filtering development
site runoff to remove suspended sediment. Technical standards and
specifications for measures to be taken to meet the following criteria are
found in the current version of the EPA NPDES General Permit For Constrnction
Site Stormwater and Rainwater and Land Development: Ohio's Standards for
Stormwater Management, Land Development and Urban Stream Protection.
   (a)   Minimization of Erosion During Development.
      (1)   Denudation and temporary stabilization.
         A.   Only the minimum necessary part of the total development area
shall be denuded at any one time.
         B.    Temporary soil stabilization treatment shall be applied within
seven (7) days following rough grading of denuded areas that will remain
dormant (undisturbed) for longer than fourteen (14) days. All necessary steps
shall be taken to condition the soil to promote proper vegetative growth.
Disturbed areas within fifty (50) feet of a stream shall be stabilized within
two (2) days.
         C.   Soil stockpiles shall be stabilized and protected with sediment
trapping measures as necessary to prevent soil loss.
      (2)   Working in or crossing streams.
         A.    If a flowing stream must be crossed by construction vehicles
regularly during construction, a temporary stream crossing shall be provided.
The structure size shall be approved by the City Engineer.
         B.   Construction vehicles shall be kept out of streams to the extent
possible. Where in-channel work is necessary, precautions shall be taken to
stabilize the work area during construction to minimize erosion. Stream
channels (including bed and banks) shall be restabilized immediately after in-
channel work is completed.
      (3)   Construction access routes. Measures shall be taken to prevent soil
transport by vehicles tracking onto surfaces where runoff is not checked by
sediment controls, or onto public roads. If soil is transported onto a public
road surface by vehicles or by runoff, the roads shall be cleaned thoroughly
each day. Soil shall be removed from paved surfaces by shoveling or sweeping.
Street washing shall be utilized only after soil has been removed by shoveling
or sweeping.
      (4)   Temporary open trenches. Where a temporary open trench accumulates
water, the City Engineer shall have the power to order the installation and use
of dewatering devices and to prescribe the manner of their discharge, so that
no safety hazard occurs and neither resources nor off-site property shall be
adversely affected.
      (5)   Sloughing and dumping. No soil, rocks, debris, or any other
material shall be dumped or placed into water resources or into such proximity
that it may readily slough, slip, or erode into water resources, unless such
dumping or placing has been authorized by the City Engineer and, when
applicable, by the Army Corps of Engineers and/or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA). (Authorization would be considered for such purposes
as, but not limited to, constructing bridges, culverts, erosion control
structures, and other in-stream or channel-bank improvement works).
   (b)   Temporary Measures for Removal of Suspended Sediment from Runoff.
Until all denuded areas have been permanently stabilized against slippage and
erosion by vegetative or other measures, the following temporary sediment
removal standards shall apply:
      (1)   Timing of sediment trapping practices. Sediment trapping practices
shall be made functional before upslope land disturbance takes place and shall
remain functional throughout earth-disturbing activity. Settling facilities,
perimeter controls, and other practices intended to trap sediment shall be
implemented before grading and grubbing. They shall continue to function until
the upslope development area is re-stabilized.
      (2)   Sediment filters. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
passed through sediment filters such as a silt fence or be diverted to settling
facilities, in order to protect adjacent properties and water resources.
      (3)    Settling facilities. Concentrated stormwater runoff denuded areas
shall pass through a temporary sediment-settling facility that has a dewatering
storage capacity of sixty-seven (67) cubic yards per acre of drainage area with
a minimum 48-hour drain time and a sediment storage zone of one thousand cubic
feet per disturbed acre. Sediment settling facilities shall be dewatered at the
pond surface using a skimmer or equivalent device. If the size of the denuded
area contributing runoff is five (5) acres or more within a single watershed,
the settling facility shall be a sediment basin. If effective perimeter
controls are used on the subject property or on adjacent property, and/or if
filtration is accomplished, then the size of the settling facility may, with
approval of the City Engineer, be modified from the minimum.
      (4)   Storm sewer inlet protection. All storm sewer inlets that accept
runoff from the development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden
water will not enter the storm sewer system without first being passed through
a sediment filter or otherwise treated to remove sediment.
   (c)   Following Development.
      (1)   Establishing of permanent vegetation. A permanent vegetation cover
shall be established and maintained on denuded areas that are not otherwise
permanently stabilized. Permanent soil stabilization treatment shall be applied
to denuded areas within seven (7) days after final grade is reached on any
portion of the site. In the event of adverse weather conditions, a reasonable
extension of this time period may be approved by the City Engineer. All
necessary steps shall be taken to condition the soil to promote proper
vegetative growth. Permanent vegetation shall be considered established only
when a ground cover is achieved that is mature and extensive enough to control
soil erosion and to survive severe weather conditions.
      (2)   Cessation of temporary practices and disposition of temporary
facilities. All temporary erosion and sediment control practices shall cease
and temporary facilities shall be disposed of within thirty (30) days after
final site stabilization is achieved or after they are no longer needed, unless
otherwise authorized by the City Engineer. Trapped sediment shall be removed or
permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion.
      (3)   Maintenance. All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment
control practices and facilities shall be maintained and repaired as needed to
assure continued performance of their intended function.

   1156.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)    The purpose of Part I of this chapter to establish technically
feasible and economically reasonable standards to achieve a level of erosion
and sediment control that will minimize damage to property and degradation of
water resources and wetlands, and will promote and maintain the health and
safety of the citizens of the City of Marietta.
   (b)    This Part will:
      (1)    Allow development while minimizing increases in erosion and
sedimentation.
      (2)    Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources and
wetlands that may be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
         (Ord. 282(22-23). Passed 6-15-23.)
   1156.02  REGULATED ACTIVITIES.
   (a)    This chapter applies to all regulated discharges outlined in the
eligibility section of the most recent version of the EPA NPDES General Permit
for Stormwater Discharges from Construction Activities. (Ord. 282(22-23).
Passed 6-15-23.)
   1156.03  APPLICATION PROCEDURES.
   (a)    Applicants must submit the following documentation to the permitting
authority prior to construction:
      (1)    An EPA NPDES General Permit Notice of Intent (NOI) form.
      (2)    Site location map.
      (3)    Two (2) copies of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWP3).
One (1) copy of the approved (SWP3) will be returned to the applicant.
   (b)   Criteria for the listed documentation must be the same as outlined in
the most current EPA NPDES General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from
Construction Activities. Within thirty (30) calendar days of the receipt of all
documentation and payment of applicable fees, the permitting authority shall
approve or disapprove the application for a sediment erosion control permit. A
statement of disapproval shall include the reason therefor and shall identify
the deficiencies in the documentation and shall state the procedures for filing
a revised plan. Upon receipt of revised documentation, the plan reviewer shall
respond with approval or disapproval within twenty-one (21) calendar days. Each
application consists of one (1) initial review of the application
documentation, and, if necessary, one (1) review of revised documentation. If
the submission of the revised documentation is disapproved, a new application
and fee will be required for processing. Once final approval has been made and
a permit issued, any subsequent changes shall be approved in writing by the
authorized agency.
   (c)   The permittee must also obtain coverage under the EPA NPDES General
Permit before earth disturbance begins. A copy of the EPA coverage letter shall
be mailed to the MS4 permitting authority as evidence of coverage. If the
operator of a project fails to obtain EPA NPDES General Permit coverage the
project will be considered an Illicit Discharge.
(Ord. 282(22-23). Passed 6-15-23.)
   1156.04 STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN.
   The applicant shall submit a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWP3)
consistent with the requirements set forth in the most recent EPA NPDES General
Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Construction Activities. For specific
requirements of a SWP3 the designer shall refer to SWP3 Check List. The SWP3
must address erosion and sediment control during construction as well as post
construction practices. Post construction practices must meet the requirements
of the most recent EPA NPDES General Permit for Construction Site Storm Water.
The SWP3 shall incorporate measures as required by Chapter
1151 Site Stabilization; Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control, Chapter
1152 Storm Water Management, and the most current edition of Rainwater and Land
Development Manual as published by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.
   (a)    Non-structural Post Construction Water Quality Practices: Non-
structural post construction best management practices include preservation,
planning, or procedures that direct development away from water resources or
limit creation of impervious surfaces. Practices such as conservation
easements, riparian and wetland setbacks, and conservation subdivision design
are all non-structural controls.
      (1)    All non-structural water quality practices must be protected from
disturbance through the construction phase of the project.
      (2)    All non-structural water quality practices must be protected in
perpetuity through the use of appropriate legal tools. All easement or
conservation areas must appear on the final plat and be disclosed to potential
buyers.
   (b)    Structural Water Quality Practices: Structural post construction best
management practices are permanent features constructed to provide treatment of
storm water runoff either through storage, filtration, or infiltration.
      (1)    All structural water quality practices must be established prior
to the completion of the project. Structural water quality practices should be
made functional once the disturbed areas on site are stabilized. If detention/
retention facilities were used for sediment control during development,
sediments must be removed prior to the basin being used for post construction
storm water quality.
      (2)    Maintenance. The post construction water quality practice must be
maintained in perpetuity by those parties identified in the SWP3 or the Storm
Water Management Maintenance Agreement.
         (Ord. 282(22-23). Passed 6-15-23.)
   1156.05  COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS.
   All submittals are required to show proof of compliance with all state and
federal regulations. Approvals issued in accordance with this Chapter do not
relieve the applicant of responsibility for obtaining all other necessary
permits and/or approvals from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
and other federal, state, and/or county agencies. If requirements vary, the
most restrictive requirement shall prevail. These permits may include, but are
not limited to, those listed below.
   (a)    Section 401 of the Clean Water Act: Proof of compliance shall be a
copy of the Ohio EPA Water Quality Certification application tracking number,
public notice, or approval letter.

developed and undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by the City
Engineer.
(Ord. 282(22-23). Passed 6-15-23.)
   1156.09  DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)    Prohibition of Illegal Discharges.
      (1)    No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the
municipal storm drain system or watercourses any materials, including but not
limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or
contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than
storm water.
      (2)    The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge
to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
      (3)   Dechlorinated water line flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted
stream flows; rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration
(infiltration is defined as water other than wastewater that enters a sewer
system, including sewer service connections and foundation drains, from the
ground through such means as defective pipes, pipe joints, connections, or
manholes. Infiltration does not include, and is distinguished from, inflow;
uncontaminated pumped ground water; discharges from dechlorinated potable water
sources; foundation drains; air conditioning condensate; irrigation water;
natural springs; water from crawl space pumps; footing drains; lawn watering;
individual residential car washing; flows from riparian habitats and wetlands;
dechlorinated swimming pool discharges; street wash water; and discharges or
flows from firefighting activities. Discharges specified in writing by the
authorized enforcement agency as being necessary to protect public health and
safety. Dye testing s an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the
test. The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge
permitted under an Ohio EPA NPDES General Permit, waiver, or waste discharge
order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the
Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in
full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other
applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been
granted for any discharge to the storm drain system.
   (b)    Prohibition of Illicit Connections.
      (1)    The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
      (2)    This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (3)    A person is considered to be in violation of this part if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue. (Ord. 282(22-23). Passed 6-15-23.)
   1156.10  SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (a)    Suspension Due to lllicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The
City Engineer may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a
person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of
the State. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an
emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the State, or
to minimize danger to persons.
   (b)    Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have his/her MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized
enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
   (c)    A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this Section, without the prior approval of the
authorized enforcement agency. (Ord. 282(22-23). Passed 6-15-23.)
   1156.11 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm
water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof
of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the City
Engineer prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. (Ord. 282(22-23).
Passed 6-15-23.)
   1156.12 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS
BY THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The City Engineer will require Best Management Practices, as defined in the
most current edition of Rainwater and Land Development Manual as published by
the Ohio Department of Natural Resources or as deemed appropriate by the City
Engineer, for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the MS4, or waters of
the State. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at his/her own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses
through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any
person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source
of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's
expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further
discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of
a valid EPA NPDES General Permit authorizing the discharge of storm water
associated with this chapter, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed
compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a
storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with
requirements of the EPA General Permit for Construction Site Storm Water.
(Ord. 282(22-23). Passed 6-15-23.)
   1156.13 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, and other obstacles that could pollute,
contaminate, and/or obstruct. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 282(22-23). Passed 6-15-23.)
   1156.14  NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the State,
said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized
enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the City Engineer within three (3) business days
of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least three (3) years.
(Ord. 282(22-23). Passed 6-15-23.)

   1301.07 UNSAFE BUILDINGS.
   (a)   Unsafe Buildings Defined.  Structures or existing equipment that are
unsafe or unsanitary due to inadequate means of egress facilities, inadequate
light and ventilation, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise
dangerous to human life, shall be deemed a serious hazard. Where a building is
found to be a serious hazard, such hazard shall be eliminated or the building
shall be vacated, and where such building, when vacated, remains a serious
hazard, it shall be razed.
   (b)   Orders, Injunction Proceedings. Where the Building Official finds that
a building is a serious hazard and the owner of such building fails, in the
time specified in an order from the Building Official, to eliminate such
hazard, or to vacate or raze the building, the building official shall proceed
under Ohio R.C. 3781.15.
   (c)   Restoration. Where the structure or equipment is determined to be
unsafe by the Building Official, it is permitted to be restored to a safe
condition. To the extent that repairs, alterations or additions are intended to
be made or a change of occupancy occurs during the restoration of the
structure, such repairs, alterations, additions or change of occupancy shall
comply with Chapters 1 and 34 of the Ohio Building Code and this chapter.

requirements, the most restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict
between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific
requirement shall be applicable.
   (b)   Other Laws. The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall not be
deemed to nullify any provisions of state or federal law. The Municipality may
make further and additional regulations, not in conflict with Ohio R.C.
Chapters 3781 and 3791 or with the rules of the Board of Building Standards.
However approval by the Board of Building Standards of any fixture, device,
material, system, assembly or product of a manufacturing process, or method or
manner of construction or installation shall constitute approval for their use
anywhere in Ohio.
   (c)   Other Rules. As provided in division (B) of Ohio R.C. 3781.11, the
rules of the Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order,
standard or rule of the Divisions of State Fire Marshal or Industrial
Compliance in the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Health and of
counties and townships, in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are
in conflict with the rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that
rules adopted and orders issued by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3743 prevail in the event of a conflict.

areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
      Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
      Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths
of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are
determined.

Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of 1
to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone B and Zone X (shaded):

      Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
      (Ord. 257(04-05). Passed 12-15-05.)
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is

flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (Ord. 2(06-07). Passed 2-2-06.)
   (q)   Floodway. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure. Any structure that is:

Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of Marietta, whose historic preservation program has been certified
by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.
LOMC’s are broken down into the following categories:
      Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
      Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
      Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies
with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management
criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
      (Ord. 257(04-05). Passed 12-15-05.)
   (z)   New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Marietta Flood
Insurance Rate Map, February 18, 1981, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
      (Ord. 2(06-07). Passed 2-2-06.)
   (aa)   Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect. A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.

professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.

would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered “new
construction,”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 257(04-05). Passed 12-15-05.)
   1311.03 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,

management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and,
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1311.11(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1311.10(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and,
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1311.10(j)(1).
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Marietta, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Marietta have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Marietta’s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Marietta boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Marietta suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Marietta has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1311.12, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1311.10(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of City of Marietta and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1311.11(i)(1)B. items 1. and 3-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Marietta specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1311.10(j)1.A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the City
Engineer in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   (c)   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Commission or any taxpayer, may
appeal such decision to the Washington County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided by the Ohio Revised Code.
   (d)   In passing upon such applications, the Commission shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter and the:
      (1)   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
      (2)   Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion danger;
      (3)   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
      (5)   Availability of alternative locations, for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (6)   Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (7)   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   Relationship of the proposed use to comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
      (10)   Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters, and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and,
      (11)   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
   (e)   Upon consideration of the factors of this section and the purposes of
this chapter, the Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
   (f)   The City Engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and
report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
   (g)   Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in (1) – (11) in Section
1311.12(d) hereof have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (2)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation shall not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (3)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and,
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance shall not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
as identified in Section
1311.12(d) or in conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure shall be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
shall commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
      (7)   Variances may only be issued where due to physical characteristics
of the property compliance with the requirements of this chapter creates an
exceptional hardship. Increased cost or inconvenience in meeting the
requirements of this chapter do not constitute an exceptional hardship.
         (Ord. 2(06-07). Passed 2-2-06.)
