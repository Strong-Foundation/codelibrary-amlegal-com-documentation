EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein. (ORC
1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance. (ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except

under designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case,
action taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

States is intended;

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance. (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be

Reinvestment Area is hereby established in the following described area: the
entire City of Deer Park as known and recorded as Plat Book 609, Pages 1

      (2)   The City of Deer Park Community Reinvestment Area is depicted on
the map attached to this Ordinance 2012-29, marked Exhibit A, and by this
reference incorporated herein.
         (Ord. 2012-29. Passed 9-10-12.)
157.02  ELIGIBILITY.

Exhibit A to Ordinance 2012-29 as being within the designated City of Deer Park

   (a)   Within the Community Reinvestment Area the percentage of the tax
exemption on the increase in the assessed valuation resulting from improvements
to commercial and industrial real property and the term of those exemptions
shall be negotiated on a case-by-case basis in advance of construction or
remodeling occurring according to the rules outlined in Ohio R.C. 3735.671. The
results of the negotiation as approved by this Council will be set in writing
in a Community Reinvestment Area Agreement as outlined in Ohio R.C. 3735.671.
The following terms and percentages will apply to tax exemptions granted on
commercial and industrial real property:
      (1)   Up to twelve (12) years for existing commercial and industrial
facilities shall be negotiated on a case-by-case basis and approved by Council
in advance of construction or remodeling occurring. The construction or

   (b)   If commercial or industrial remodeling qualifies for an exemption,
during the period of exemption, the dollar amount of the increase in market

construction qualifies for an exemption, during the period of the exemption the
structure shall not be considered to be an improvement on the land on which it
is located for the purpose of real property taxation.
   (c)   If the proposed exemption granted on commercial or industrial real
property exceeds fifty percent (50%), local school district consent is required
unless the Council determines, for each year of the proposed exemption, that at
least fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the taxes estimated that would have
been charged on the improvements if the exemption had not taken place will be
made up by other taxes or payments available to the school district. Upon
notice of a project that does not meet this standard, the board of education
may approve the project even though the new revenues do not equal at least
fifty percent (50%) of the projected taxes prior to the exemption.
   (d)   The following terms and percentages will apply to tax exemptions
granted on residential real property:
      (1)   Ten (10) years for residential remodeling (2 units or less). The

(Ord. 2012-29. Passed 9-10-12.)
TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and Criminal
Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged with an
offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is such
that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before him
and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

allocation of net profits to the City.

authorized to provide by regulation that the return of an employer or
employers, showing the amount of tax deducted by such employer or employers
from the salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation of an employee, and

pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.07, where an income tax has been paid another municipality, credit for the
amount so paid in accordance with Section
181.14 hereof, shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the
balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.

no additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall be
collected or refunded.

compensation. A taxpayer with two or more unincorporated business activities
can offset them against each other to arrive at overall net profit or loss.
   (e)    (1)    Where necessary an amended return must be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
Sections

Commissioner. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)    Within three months from the final determination of any Federal
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City tax
based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any
additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.

to the Municipality, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer. Each
employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and

on any additional tax assessment resulting from a Federal audit, providing an
amended return is filed and additional tax is paid within three months after
final determination of the Federal tax liability.

assessment shall not be made after three years from the time the return was due
or filed whichever is later, provided, however, in those cases in which the

Federal statute of limitation, the period within which an additional assessment

182.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (1)    "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under division 22(D) of this section, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:    
      (A)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (C)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
      (D)   (i)    Except as provided in division (1)(D)(ii) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (ii)    Division (1)(D)(i) of this section does not apply to the
extent the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250
of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (E)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;
      (F)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;
      (G)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02

this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
         (ii)    No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (1)(H)
of this section to offset qualifying wages.
         (iii)   (a)    For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021,
or 2022, a person may not deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a

than fifty per cent of the amount of the deduction otherwise allowed by
division (1)(H)(i) of this section.
            (b)    For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a person

the extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully utilized in
one or more taxable years by operation of division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this
section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in
division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section shall apply to the amount carried
forward.

adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.

federal self-employment tax.

Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality’s income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
section
182.052  of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)    In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)    (1)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit
to the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld

to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of each
calendar quarter.
         (b)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen
days after the last day of each month.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under section
182.091 of this Chapter.
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying

disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee’s qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

      For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee
spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of

professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.

shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee’s principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;

         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.

municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)

tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
182.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section

include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid

      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the

   (B) (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
182.19  of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the

corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria in (a), (b), or (c). For taxable years beginning on or after
January 1, 2018, gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where
title passes, the property meets either of the following criteria (a) or (b).
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
Criteria (c) applies to taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2018, and
is not applicable for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.

accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
182.081  of this Chapter.
   (G)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section
182.03(10)(L) and Section
182.03(33)(A) of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer
has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount
that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned
to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add
to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.

         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a

      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1)
or (2) of this section is binding upon the State of Ohio Tax Commissioner for
the remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code is
terminated, a valid election under section 718.86 of the Revised Code is

intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
182.03(1) of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062  of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section 
182.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
182.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

not exceeding fifteen years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance
allowing such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit. (Ord. 2015-20. Passed

year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined

combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by

and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five

      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections 718.80 through 718.95 of the Revised Code and
shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in accordance with
section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least

year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.

   (A)    Every person residing in a Municipal Corporation who receives net
profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal service compensation
for work done or services performed or rendered outside of the Municipal
Corporation, if it be made to appear that he has paid a Municipal Corporation
income tax on the same income taxable under this chapter to another Municipal
Corporation, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter
of the amount so paid by him or on his behalf to such other Municipal
Corporation. The credit shall not exceed one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the
tax assessed by this Chapter on such income tax earned in such other Municipal
Corporation or Municipal Corporations where such tax is paid.
   (B)    A claim for refund or credit under this section shall be made in such
manner as the Tax Administrator may provide by regulation.

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
“qualifying loss” means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer’s receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the “qualifying loss” is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal
corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan. If different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the
“qualifying tax rate” is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The
weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)    (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)    If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation’s proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)    (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer’s qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer’s terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation. (Ord. 2015-20. Passed 10-12-15.)
182.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
182.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2015-20. Passed 10-12-15.)
182.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
 
   (B)    Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
182.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality’s tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)    No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
 
   (D)    Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
182.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 2015-20. Passed 10-12-15.)

   (A)    (1)    An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on

every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection
182.051(C) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer’s sole

return with the Municipality, regardless of income or liability.

required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)    (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)    A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this

municipal corporation, Ohio IT 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return
or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund
request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not

Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.

      (4)    A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net

   available, submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business
gateway or a portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall
publish a method of electronically submitting the documents required under this
division through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The
department shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this
division to the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)    Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)    (1)    (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer’s taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)    In the case of individual income tax return required to be
filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed
by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)    With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
182.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
182.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
182.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)    (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
182.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, “submitted the payment” means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
182.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality’s Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)    (1)    As used in this division, “worksite location” has the same
meaning as in Section
182.052  of this chapter.
      (2)    A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)    The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)    The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation’s
income tax for the taxable year.
      The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement:
      “The affiant has no plans to perform any services within the municipal
corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during the taxable year.
If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a
taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal corporation,
if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation’s resolutions,
ordinances, or rules.” The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of
perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2)
of this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year.
      Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator
from performing an audit of the person.
            (Ord. 2015-20. Passed 10-12-15.)

reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)    (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. 2015-20. Passed 10-12-15.)
182.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
   (F)   This division is not subject to Ohio Revised Code Sections 718.80 to
718.95. See section 182.097 for election to be subject to Revised Code Sections
718.80 to 718.95.
(Ord. 2018-11. Passed 2-26-18.)
182.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer’s municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer’s requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the

182.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)    A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)    Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
182.19  of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by Section
182.19 (A)(2) of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed
beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section 
182.096  of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
         (Ord. 2015-20. Passed 10-12-15.)
 
182.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)    (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer’s claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.18  of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
182.10(A)(4) of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, “withholding tax” has the same meaning as in
section
182.10 of this Chapter.

preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement. (Ord. 2015-20. Passed
10-12-15.)
182.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to

subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax

      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality’s income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)    A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or

(Ord. 2015-20. Passed 10-12-15.)
182.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 2015-20. Passed 10-12-15)
182.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.

as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member’s
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final

on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)    The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.

182.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)    (1)    (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section

agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the

limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
182.18  of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,

   (D)    (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
182.18  of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to
which the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that
the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less
than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the
appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the
overpayment as provided by Section
182.096  of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the

         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;

time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under

applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall

nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible

registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle

vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;

the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05 , pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,

313.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

   (a)   No person shall place, maintain or display upon or in view of any
street any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device which purports to be,
is an imitation of or resembles a traffic control device or railroad sign or
signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from view
or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit upon any street any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to streets of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic
control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.211 and

   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
         B.   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
      B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a
         condition of community control and in addition to the required
attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily
complete any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum
standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental
Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the drivers’ intervention
program determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to
the court on the offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose
on the offender any other conditions of community control that it considers
necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or

school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property lines, except when
those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)(1)A. and C.
hereof.

information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school zone on any
portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet

shall specify the time, place and speed at which the defendant is alleged to
have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared

instead may elect to attend the distracted driving safety course, as described
in Section
303.991. If the offender attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall not be required to pay the fine and
shall not have the points assessed against that offender’s driver’s license if
the offender submits the written evidence to the court. This subsection does

subsection (d)(1)B., C., or D. of this section applies.

      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense
as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based
on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for the purposes of enforcing this
section unless the officer visually observes the operator using, holding, or
physically supporting with any part of the person’s body the electronic
wireless communications device.

for a violation of subsection (a) of this section shall inform the operator
that the operator may decline a search of the operator’s electronic wireless

device;
         B.   Confiscate the device while awaiting the issuance of a warrant to
access the device;

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

identification card is now issued in this state. The Registrar or a deputy
registrar shall destroy any such license, temporary instruction permit, or
identification card that is not returned to the issuing authority.
      (3)   No person shall possess more than one valid license, temporary

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to
   five hundred hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of
community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal
contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the
underlying case. If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously

this section shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00). In addition, the

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two
offenses are allied offenses of similar import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.

that order.
   (b)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5)
of this section has occurred, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the
offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of the

this section.
      (1)   Except as provided in subsection (c)(2) of this section, whoever

driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C. 4510.02, and, if the vehicle involved

the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to

issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as
determined by publications of the national automobile dealer’s association. The
proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed in
accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the
immobilization before the termination of the period of immobilization ordered
unless the court is presented with current proof of financial responsibility
with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community
service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an offender to complete a
term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect
criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.
4507.35 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a
misdemeanor of the first degree. (ORC 4507.35)

law in any other jurisdiction in which the person’s license or permit was
issued shall operate any motor vehicle upon the public roads and highways or

privileges.
   (b)   No person shall operate any motor vehicle upon a highway or any public
or private property used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel or
parking in this Municipality in violation of any restriction of the person’s
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit imposed under division (D) of
Ohio R.C. 4506.10 or under Ohio R.C. 4507.14.
   (c)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.
   (d)   Whoever violates subsection (a) or (b) hereof, is guilty of an
unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the
offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except
that the offender shall not be sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not
be sentenced to a community residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26;
notwithstanding division (a)(2)(A) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be
fined up to one thousand dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3)
of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of

Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case.
   (e)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or
after committing the offense for which the offender is sentenced under this
section.
   (f)   Any person whose driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privileges are suspended as a repeat traffic offender
under this section and who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle
upon any public roads and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point
suspension, a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the
offender to a minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the
first three days of jail time imposed pursuant to this subsection.
(Ord. 2013-16. Passed 7-22-13.)
   (g)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

court instead imposes a sentence of not less than thirty consecutive days of
house arrest with electronic monitoring. A period of house arrest with
electronic monitoring imposed under this subsection shall not exceed six
months. If the court imposes a mandatory three-day jail term under this
subsection, the court may impose a jail term in addition to that term, provided
that in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense exceed
six months.
         B.   A fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) and
not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000).
         C.   A license suspension under subsection (e) of this section.
      (2)   If, within six years of the offense, the offender previously has

lieu of the mandatory portion of the jail term.
         B.   Notwithstanding the fines set forth in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, a
fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) and not more than two

offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the sixty-day period following the date
of sentencing.

corporation pursuant to division (H) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191.

or ordinance, the trial judge of any court of record or the mayor of a mayor’s
court shall impose on an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of this section a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s

though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section 
501.08 .
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. (ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 ELECTRONICALLY MONITORED HOUSE ARREST.
   (a)   Any or all of the term of imprisonment authorized under the ordinances
of the City may be served by means of electronically monitored house arrest, in
the sole discretion of the Mayor. In such case, the Mayor shall determine the
number of days of actual imprisonment, the number of days of electronically
monitored house arrest, and whether any of the days of actual imprisonment
shall be suspended on the condition of successful completion of the
incarceration by electronically monitored house arrest. The sum of the days of
actual imprisonment plus the days of electronically monitored house arrest
shall not exceed the stated maximum number of days of imprisonment for that
particular offense.
   (b)   No individual may serve a term of imprisonment by electronically
monitored house arrest unless he or she first executes an appropriate agreement
made available to all such defendants, whereby the defendants agree to pay the
cost of the system (or, in the sole discretion of the Mayor, such portion of
the cost as he or she can afford to pay) and agrees to abide by all of the
rules and regulations of the electronically monitored house arrest procedure.
The agreement shall provide that no credit for suspended days of actual
incarceration shall be granted unless the defendant successfully completes all
of the days of the electronically monitored house arrest.
   (c)   No person, knowing that he or she is under the restrictions of
electronically monitored house arrest, shall purposely break or attempt to
break such detention, or purposely violate any of the requirements of the
detention. Whoever violates this section is guilty of escape, a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
(Ord. 90-44. Passed 10-8-90.)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s
            representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s
estate disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount
of full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
   A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred eighty
days;
   B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
   C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
   D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c). (ORC 2929.31)

505.02 IMPOUNDING AND DISPOSITION; RECORDS.
   (a)   A police officer or animal warden may impound every animal or dog
found in violation of Section
505.01. If the dog is not wearing a valid registration tag and the owner is not
otherwise reasonably determined, notice shall be posted in the pound or animal
shelter both describing the dog and place where seized and advising the unknown
owner that unless the dog is redeemed within three days, it may thereafter be
sold or destroyed according to law. If the dog is wearing a valid registration
tag or the identity of the owner, keeper or harborer is otherwise reasonably
determined, notice shall be given by certified mail to such owner, keeper or
harborer that the dog has been impounded and unless redeemed within fourteen

opening of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

artistic purpose.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions
of Section
545.05 or
545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

registration as prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United

   CROSS REFERENCES
   Mayor’s Court - see ADM. Ch.
171
 
 
 
 
555.01 CONTEMPT OF COURT.
   (a)   Direct Contempt. A person guilty of any of the following acts may be
punished summarily by the Mayor (or a magistrate or the Mayor’s designate in
the absence of the Mayor or the Magistrate):
      (1)   Disorderly, contemptuous or insolent behavior towards the Mayor or
the Magistrate in the Mayor’s Court, tending to interrupt the due course of the
court proceeding;
      (2)   A breach of the peace, boisterous conduct or a violent disturbance
tending to interrupt the due course of the Mayor’s court proceeding; or
      (3)   Willful resistance in the presence of the Mayor or the Magistrate
to the execution of an order of the court or the procedures of the court.
   (b)   Indirect Contempt. The Mayor or the Magistrate, after notice and
proper procedural notice to the defendant, may punish indirect contempts of
court in order to preserve order in judicial proceedings in the City and to
effectively enforce the judgments and orders of the Mayor’s court as follows:
      (1)   The disobedience of or resistance to a lawful order or sentence of
the court or an officer of the court;
      (2)   The failure to obey a subpoena lawfully served or the refusal to be
sworn as a witness when lawfully required;
      (3)   The failure of an individual to appear as a witness in court or to
appear in his or her own case proceeding in compliance with the terms of his or
her previous recognizance;
      (4)   The failure to properly carry out a sentence of the Court,
regarding work detail assignments, home incarceration, restitution or other
sentence of the court; or
      (5)   Any other common law contempt of court for which common pleas
judges may punish as contempts in order that the Mayor or the Magistrate may
properly enforce judgment, orders and decrees of the Mayor’s court.
   (c)   Hearing. The Mayor (or Magistrate or the Mayor’s designate in his
absence) may summarily punish for direct contempts of court by entry upon the
Mayor’s court journal if the Mayor or the Magistrate finds the defendant guilty
of direct contempt in the presence of the court so as to obstruct the
administration of justice in the Mayor’s court.
   Any individual charged with indirect contempt of court shall have an
opportunity for a hearing, by himself or herself or with the assistance of
counsel, by an entry made upon the Mayor’s court journal. This provision does
not prevent the Mayor or the Magistrate of the Mayor’s court from issuing an
arrest warrant to bring the accused into court or from holding the accused in
custody, pending such proceedings. In the trial of the indirect contempt
charge, the Mayor or the Magistrate shall determine the nature of the charge,
hear any answer or testimony which the accused makes or offers and shall
determine whether the accused is guilty by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.
   (d)   Suspended Sentence. The Mayor or Magistrate may elect to suspend a
portion of the sentence imposed on an individual found guilty in the Mayor’s
court under such conditions as the Mayor or Magistrate shall deem appropriate.
The Mayor or Magistrate may compel the reappearance of the individual convicted
at a subsequent time in order to ascertain whether the conditions imposed upon
the individual have been successfully completed. In such event, the Mayor or
Magistrate may elect to reimpose the suspended portion of the sentence if the
Mayor or Magistrate determines that the convicted individual has not complied
with the prior order or conditions imposed upon such individual.
   (e)   Punishment. An individual convicted of direct contempt of court may be
imprisoned for not more than ten days or fined not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00). In the event that the defendant is guilty of contempt of
court which consists of the omission to perform an act which the defendant has
the capability to perform, the defendant may be imprisoned after conviction
until the defendant performs the act. If the defendant has failed to appear
upon the date named, the court may issue an arrest warrant or order the
forfeiture of the appearance bond of the defendant, or both. An individual
found guilty of indirect contempt of court may be fined up to five hundred
dollars ($500.00) for each such contempt and may be imprisoned not more than
ten days for such contempt, or both, in the sole discretion of the Mayor or the
Magistrate.

outside edge not less than three feet from the curb line, the driveway shall
ramp from the grade at the edge of the walkway to a grade not less than one and
three-fourths inch above the gutter grade. Across the walkway and for at least
one foot farther towards the street property line, the grade of the driveway
shall coincide with the cross grade of the walkway. On improved streets where
there are no walkways, the standard walkway grade shall be carried to the
street property line. On streets having no curbs or walkways, the traveled
roadway shall be considered the established grade and the slope of the driveway
from the roadway to the street property line shall rise at the rate of one-half
inch per foot.

be filed with the Zoning Inspector for review by the Board of Zoning Appeals
upon the forms provided, and shall be accompanied by the following requirements
necessary to convey the reason(s) for the requested variance:

days of the date of the written notice from the Zoning Inspector or such

   (d)   Review by the Board. According to the procedures established for
appeals in this chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public
hearing and give notice of the same. The Board shall review each application
for an area variance to determine if it complies with the purpose and intent of
this Zoning Code and evidence demonstrates that the literal enforcement of this
Zoning Code will result in practical difficulty. The following factors shall be
considered and weighed by the Board to determine practical difficulty:
       (1)    Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district. Examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are exceptional irregularity,
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot, or adjacency to non-conforming
and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions;
      (2)    Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (3)    Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary
to make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
      (4)    Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
       (5)    Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, trash pickup;
      (6)    Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restrictions;
      (7)    Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the owner;
      (8)    Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
      (9)    Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance; and
      (10)    Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
   (e)   Requests for Additional Information. The Board of Zoning Appeals may
request that the applicant supply additional information that the Board deems
necessary to review and evaluate the request for a variance.
   (f)    Additional Conditions and Safeguards. The Board may further prescribe
any conditions and safeguards that it deems necessary to ensure that the
objectives of the regulation(s) or provision(s) to which the variance applies
will be met.
   (g)    Action by the Board. The Board shall either approve, approve with
conditions as specified in division (f) above, or disapprove the request for an
area variance. In no case shall the Board of Zoning Appeals approve a variance
that establishes a nonconforming use of land, building or structure where one
had not previously existed.
   (h)    Term and Extension of Variance. Area variances shall be non-
assignable without the written approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals and
shall expire one year from the date of the variance issuance, unless prior
thereto, the applicant substantially initiated work within one year in
accordance with the granted variance or an extension of time has been granted
by the Board of Zoning Appeals. “Substantially initiated” shall mean expending
monies towards completing the project equal to at least 25% of the value of the
total work to be performed. A variance shall also expire if the applicant fails
to substantially complete the work within two years from the date of the
variance issuance. “Substantially completed” shall mean expending monies
towards completing the project equal to at least 90% of the value of the total
work to be performed. Once the time limit pursuant to this section has expired,
a request for a variance shall be considered to be a new application for a
variance and shall meet all requirements for application and review pursuant to
this section. Area variances approved in conjunction with a site plan
application, shall remain valid for a one-year period.
1105.11 USE VARIANCES.
      The granting of use variances shall be prohibited. An applicant seeking
to use a structure or parcel of land in a manner that is not consistent with
the permitted uses or conditional uses for the zoning district in question, may
seek a change in land use through an amendment of the zoning map or zoning text
following the procedures set forth in Chapter
1109.

structure, until a certificate of occupancy required as part of the building
permit procedure has been issued by the Zoning Inspector stating that the
proposed use for the building or land conforms to the requirements of this
Zoning Code. The issuance of a certificate of occupancy in no way relieves the
recipient from compliance with all requirements of this Zoning Code and other
regulations.

for a period not to exceed six (6) months during alterations or partial

and applications approved by the Zoning Inspector authorize only the use and

occurred, a person may file a complaint with the Zoning Inspector. The Zoning
Inspector shall properly record such complaint, immediately investigate it, and
take action thereon as provided by this Zoning Code.
1107.12  ENTRY AND INSPECTION OF PROPERTY.
   The Zoning Inspector is authorized to make inspections of properties and
structures in order to examine and survey the same, at any reasonable hour, for
the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this Zoning Code. Prior to seeking
entry to any property or structure for such examination or survey, the Zoning
Inspector shall attempt to obtain the permission of the owner or occupant to
inspect. If such permission is denied or cannot be obtained, the Zoning
Inspector shall request the assistance of the Law Director in securing a valid
search warrant prior to entry.
1107.13 ZONING PERMIT REVOCATION.
   The Zoning Inspector may issue a revocation notice to revoke a zoning permit
or administrative approval which was issued contrary to this Zoning Code or

   Whenever the Zoning Inspector or his or her agent determines that there is a
violation of any provision of this Zoning Code, a certified letter to the

followed to subdivide land.
1115.02 CLASSIFICATION AND DETERMINATION OF SUBDIVISION TYPES.
   There are two basic types of subdivisions:
   (a)   Lot Split/Minor Subdivision (Approval Without Plat). For the purpose
of subdivision plat review, the Zoning Inspector may determine that a proposed
subdivision of land is a minor subdivision if the proposed division of a parcel
of land is along an existing public street, does not involve the opening,
widening or extension of any street or road and does not involve more than five
lots after the original tract has been completely subdivided. In the event, the
Zoning Inspector determines no major subdivision plat approval through the
Planning and Zoning Commission is required, the proposed division shall not be
contrary to applicable zoning regulations or these Subdivision Regulations.
   (b)   Major Subdivision. Any subdivision that does not meet the requirements
of a lot split/minor subdivision shall be considered a Major Subdivision.
1115.03 LOT SPLIT / MINOR SUBDIVISION PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Review and Approval. The Planning and Zoning Commission is hereby
designated as having authority of review and approval. The Commission may, at
its discretion, designate an authorized representative to approve or disapprove
lot split/minor subdivisions.
   (b)   Submissions. Any person proposing to create a lot split/minor
subdivision shall submit to the Planning and Zoning Commission via the Zoning
Inspector:
      (1)   A completed application for a lot split/minor subdivision on the
form for the same as provided by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (2)   A copy of the County Tax Maps showing the parcel to be split or
subdivided and indicating the approximate dimensions of the proposed new
parcels.
      (3)   Payment of the appropriate fee as established by the fee schedule
as adopted by City Council. The Planning and Zoning Commission may request
additional detailed information such as:
         A.   A legal description of each parcel to be created by the lot
split/minor subdivision.
         B.   A copy of a surveyor's drawing (accurate to scale) showing the
total parcel and how it is to be split or subdivided.
         C.   Construction drawings for all on-site and off-site infrastructure
   improvements.
         D.   Other information the Planning and Zoning Commission deems
appropriate.
(4)   Written approval signed by the Zoning Inspector and the Hamilton County
Board of Health.
   (c)   Standards for Approval. For a lot split/minor subdivision to be
approved, it must meet the following standards:
      (1)   There shall not be more than five parcels created from an original
tract.
      (2)   All proposed lots must meet the zoning requirements of this zoning
code.
      (3)   All lots must have a minimum front footage, as established by the
Deer Park City Zoning Code.
      (4)   No building site on a proposed parcel shall be within a designated
floodway area, as recognized on the official FEMA Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps.
      (5)   The proposal shall not involve the opening, widening or extension
of a public or private street or easement of access.
      (6)   Public water and sewer facilities are available to the site for
immediate     connection.
   (d)   Action by the Commission. Based upon the standards set forth in
subsection (c) hereof and the fulfillment of the proper submission
requirements, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall take one of the
following actions within twenty working days of the proper submission:
      (1)   Approve the lot split/minor subdivision and stamp the instrument of
conveyance "Approved By The Deer Park City Planning and Zoning Commission, No
Plat Required" and affix the Zoning Inspector's signature and date. The
approval shall expire after one year, unless the conveyance is recorded in the
office of the Hamilton County Recorder.
      (2)   Not approve the proposed lot split/minor subdivision and notify the
applicant, in writing, stating the reason for the disapproval.
1115.04 MAJOR SUBDIVISION APPROVAL PROCEDURE.
   Major subdivisions shall be approved in three stages: sketch plat stage,
preliminary plat stage and final plat stage as follows:
   (a)   The sketch plat stage requires the subdivider to present a sketch-type
plat to the Zoning Inspector for the purpose of determining street
classifications, acceptable street names, an acceptable subdivision name and
possible problems with zoning, storm water drainage, sanitary sewer and water
service and other community facilities, such as the elements of the City's
Comprehensive Plan, school system and transportation routes. This stage ensures
that the subdivider will not expend extensive monies developing detailed plans
and plats that may not be acceptable to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (b)   The preliminary plat stage requires the subdivider to present all
information needed to enable the Planning and Zoning Commission to determine
that the proposed layout is satisfactory and will serve the public interest.
This stage also ensures that the subdivider will not be required to expend
extensive construction level design monies without some assurance that his or
her plat will be finally approved.
   (c)   The final plat stage requires the subdivides to present all
construction level data needed to enable the Planning and Zoning Commission to
determine that the subdivision fully complies with these Subdivision
Regulations and conforms to the approved preliminary plat. After approval of
the final plat by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the Commission will
forward to City Council its recommendation for acceptance of proposed street
dedications and the improvement surety amount.
1115.05 SUBMITTAL OF SKETCH PLAT.
   (a)   The subdivider shall submit to the Zoning Inspector twelve (12) copies
of his or her sketch plat which, as a minimum, shall contain the following:

facilities, thoroughfares and other transportation modes, shopping centers,
manufacturing establishments, residential developments and existing natural and
man-made features, such as general soil types and vegetation, as needed for
runoff calculations (vegetation in terms of meadow, thicket, etc.) and
utilities in the neighboring areas.
      (2)   The layout of streets, lots and any nonresidential sites or
recreational uses within the proposed subdivision. If the subdivision is to be
developed in phases, the layout of streets, lots and any nonresidential sites
for the entire tract shall be included in the sketch plat.
      (3)   The location of existing utilities in the proposed subdivision, if
available, or the locations of the nearest sources for water and disposal of

dimensions, proposed street namesand the date.
      (5)   Existing permanent buildings.
   (b)   The Zoning Inspector shall, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the
sketch plat, compile all related information, review the proposal and visit the
site, and if, in his or her judgment, the sketch is in conformance with these
Subdivision Regulations, the Zoning Inspector will inform the subdivider to
prepare and submit a preliminary plat in accordance with these Regulations. If
the sketch plat does not conform to these Regulations, the subdivider shall
incorporate all necessary changes to bring the plat into compliance with these
Regulations. Further, the Zoning Inspector shall advise the subdivider of:
      (1)   Appropriate street classifications.
      (2)   Approved or rejected street and subdivision names.
      (3)   Any other areas that need to be addressed as a result of his or her
review and site visit.
   (c)   Upon receipt, in writing, from the Zoning Inspector of approval of the
sketch plat, the subdivider shall have twelve (12) months to submit a
preliminary plat. If the preliminary plat is not submitted in said time, the
approval of the sketch plat becomes null and void.

posted at such time as the improvements are accepted as complete by the City
Engineer.
      (2)   The subdivider shall be responsible for the maintenance of all
improvements against faulty workmanship, including all sedimentation and
erosion controls, and shall repair all failures as soon as they become
apparent.
      (3)   The streets and other improvements shall be in a condition
acceptable to the City at the end of the maintenance period. If the subdivider
fails to perform such maintenance to the complete satisfaction of the City, the
City may use such surety guarantee to make the necessary repairs at its
discretion.
1115.15 FEES FOR ENGINEERING SERVICES.
   (a)   It shall be the duty of the City Council to establish schedules of
fees for plans, specifications, printing, construction inspection, design
engineering and other engineering services performed by the City, which shall

such costs.
   (b)   The Zoning Inspector, or his or her representative, is hereby
authorized and directed to collect such fees and deposit them with the City
Auditor.
   (c)   For inspections of private projects outside the City Government, the
Zoning Inspector, or his or her designee, is hereby given the prerogative to
authorize the commencement of a project by a private contractor, with charges
determined and charged after the completion of such project or at an earlier
period of time. When a developer or contractor has no record of service with
the City or other unusual circumstances exist, the Zoning Inspector may
estimate the inspection charges and require payment of 110 percent of that
total be paid to the City prior to the commencement of any work.
   (d)   As the actual inspection charges are being paid and accrued, the
Zoning Inspector shall, from time to time, re-estimate the inspection charges

Subdivision Design Standards
1117.01   Physical considerations.
1117.02   Streets.
1117.03   Sidewalks.
1117.04   Easements.
1117.05   Utilities.

1117.09   Storm drainage.
 
 
 
1117.01 PHYSICAL CONSIDERATIONS.
    (a)    Natural Land Use. Subdivisions should be planned to take advantage
of the topography of the land, to economize in the construction of drainage
facilities, to reduce the amount of grading and to minimize destruction of
trees and topsoil.
    (b)    Flooding Areas. In order to protect the health, safety and general
welfare of the people, the Planning and Zoning Commission may reject a proposed
subdivision located in an area subject to periodic flooding. Whenever a
subdivision is proposed to be located in an area having poor drainage or other
adverse physical characteristics and impairment, the Commission may approve the
plat provided that the developer binds himself or herself legally to make such
improvements as, in the judgment of the Planning and Zoning Commission, will
render the subdivision substantially safe and otherwise acceptable for the
intended use. In such case, the developer shall post with the Commission a
surety, acceptable to the Commission, sufficient to cover the cost of such
improvements as estimated by the officials having jurisdiction.
    (c)    Conformity to the Transportation Master Plan. The subdivision layout
shall conform to the City's Transportation Master Plan. Whenever a tract to be
subdivided embraces any part of a highway, thoroughfare, parkway or other major
arterial, minor arterial or collector street so designated on such Plan, such
part of such public way shall be platted by the developer.
1117.02 STREETS.
    (a)    Conformity to City Standards. The arrangement, character, extent,
width and location of all streets shall conform to the City's Transportation
Master Plan and the requirements set forth herein, unless specific requirements
are waived by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The design of proposed
streets and public access to adjacent un-platted lands shall be arranged so
that the entire area can be served with a coordinated public street system. All
streets must be built to City standards.
    (b)    General Roadway Classifications.
      (1)   Major arterial thoroughfares shall be planned for the continuation
of movement of fast traffic, generally over forty-five miles per hour, between
points of heavy traffic generation and from one section of the community to
another. They shall contain as few intersections with minor streets as
possible.
      (2)   Minor arterial thoroughfares are similar in nature to major
arterials, but are for lower volumes and speeds, generally thirty-five to
forty-five miles per hour.
      (3)   Collector streets shall provide a traffic route from local streets
to arterial thoroughfares. Collector streets normally contain a relatively
large number of intersections with local streets and few intersections with
arterial thoroughfares.
      (4)   Local streets shall provide direct and full access to each lot and
shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. The
street system shall be designed so that all proposed streets shall be in
conformity with modern practices of land subdivision and in general conformity
with a plan for the most advantageous development of the entire neighborhood.
The streets shall be extended to the boundaries of the tract to be recorded and
aligned with existing streets, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions or unless, in the opinion of the Planning and Zoning Commission,
such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout
of the subdivision with the development of adjacent tracts. Dead-end streets or
cul-de-sacs will be approved only when necessitated by topography or other
physical conditions or where, in the opinion of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, they are appropriate for the type of development contemplated.
    (c)    Street Right-of-Way and Pavement Widths. Street right-of-way and
pavement widths shall be as follows:
Classification
Right-of-Way Width (ft.)
Pavement Width (ft.)
Major
   80
64
Minor
80
54
Collector
60
40
Local
50
28
Over 500 ft. in length
50
32
Up to 500 ft. in length
50
28
 
   Pavement width is measured from back-of-curb to back-of-curb.
    (d)    Cul-de-Sac and Dead-End Streets.
       (1)   A street designed to be a permanent cul-de-sac should not be
longer than 800 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround
having an outside pavement diameter of at least eighty feet and a street right-
of-way line diameter of at least 100 feet.
      (2)    If the subdivision creates a temporary dead-end street that is
intended to be extended in the future, an eighty-foot diameter turn-around
shall be constructed of six inches of 304 compacted base material. Such. turn-
around shall be within an easement granted to the City by the developer and
shall be maintained to the satisfaction of the City Engineer. Such easement
shall be automatically vacated to the abutted property owners when the dead-end
street is legally extended and an additional right-of-way dedicated to the
City. If such dead-end street is not          legally extended within five
years of approval of the final plat that created it, the developer must
construct a turn-around as required for a permanent cul-de-sac (including curb
and gutter) and dedicate the required 100-foot right-of-way to public use. If
such dead-end street extends only the depth of the corner lot past a street
intersection, no turn-around will be required.
    (e)    Grades. It is recognized that the maximum grade must vary with the
severity of the natural terrain. Thus, the following maximum grades are set:
      (1)    Level terrain: four percent maximum grade
      (2)    Rolling terrain: eight percent maximum grade
      (3)   Hilly terrain: fifteen percent maximum grade with an absolute
minimum grade of 0.5 percent is required.
    (g)    Changes in Grades. All changes in street grades in excess of one
percent shall be connected by vertical curves. The minimum length of a vertical
curve shall be twenty tunes the algebraic difference in the rate of grade for
major, minor or industrial streets and fifteen times the algebraic difference
in the rate of grade for collector or local streets. Grade changes (with or
without a vertical curve) shall be no closer than 300 feet.
    (h)    Minimum Centerline Radii. The minimum centerline radius for
horizontal curves shall be 400 feet for major, minor or industrial streets and
100 feet for collector or local streets.
    (i)    Reverse Horizontal Curves. Major, minor, and industrial streets
shall have a minimum 100-foot tangent section between reverse horizontal
curves. No minimum tangent section is required for collector or local streets.
    (j)    Intersections.
      (1)    Intersections shall be no closer than 125 feet on local or
collector streets and no closer than 250 feet on major, minor or industrial
streets. The highest level (most restrictive) street involved governs.
       (2)    Curbs at intersections shall be rounded, using the following
minimum radii:
          A.    Major -    50
         B.    Minor -    45
         C.    Collector -    30
         D.    Local -    30
      (3)    The minimums set forth in paragraph (j)(2) hereof shall increase
to the     following when the minimum angle of intersection is between sixty
and seventy-five degrees:
A.    Major -    55
B.    Minor -    55
C.    Collector -    45
D.    Local -    40
      (4)    Intersections with an angle less than sixty degrees will not be
permitted.
1117.03 SIDEWALKS.
    (a)    Sidewalks shall be installed on both sides of all new public
streets, unless this requirement is specifically waived by the Planning and
Zoning Commission.
    (b)    Sidewalks shall be a minimum width of four feet. Curb ramps shall be
constructed at all street intersections. The ramps shall be constructed in
accordance with specifications and details set forth by the City Engineer.
    (c)    In addition, pedestrian easement ways, not less than twenty (20)
feet wide and constructed to a width of not less than eight (8) feet, shall be
required across blocks where the Commission determines that pedestrian access
to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation and other community
facilities is necessary.
    (d)    Sidewalks shall be constructed of Portland cement concrete.
1117.04 EASEMENTS.
    (a)    As a minimum, a five (5)foot easement along side lot lines and a
seven and one-half foot easement along rear lot lines shall be provided on all
lots. The purpose of the easement shall be for stormwater facilities as needed.
    (b)    Drainage easements shall be given to the City of Deer Park for all

titled "The City of Deer Park Zoning Map." A certified copy of this map is on
file in the office of the Safety-Service Director and said map, together with
all notations, dimensions, and designations shown thereon are hereby declared
to be a part of this Zoning Code. The Zoning Map shall be signed by the Mayor
and attested to by the City Clerk.
1121.02 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
        Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the
zoning districts as shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
   (a)   Parallel district boundaries. Where district boundaries appear to be
approximately parallel to the center lines or street lines of streets or the
center lines or right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall
be construed as parallel thereto and at such distance therefore as indicated on
the Zoning Map. If no distance is given, such dimensions shall be determined by
the use of the scale shown on the Zoning Map.
   (b)   Boundaries of zoning districts. Boundaries of zoning districts are
intended to follow property lines. Where zoning district boundaries are shown
as being parallel to a right-of-way, those lots that have frontage on such
right-of-way are intended to be within such a zoning district.
   (c)   Lot lines, railroad lines, and waterways. Where district boundaries
approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed as a boundary
of a zoning district. Where the boundary of a district follows a railroad line,
such boundary shall be deemed to be located in the middle of the main tracks of
said railroad line. Where the boundary of a district follows (or parallels) a
waterway, such boundary shall be deemed to be located in the middle (or
parallel to) the centerline of said waterway.
   (d)   Interpretation by Planning and Zoning Commission. Any questions of
interpretation of the Zoning Map which cannot otherwise be resolved, shall be
referred to the Planning and Zoning Commission for a determination.

1135.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these regulations is to encourage the appropriate development
of tracts of land sufficiently large to allow comprehensive Planning and
Zoning, and to provide flexibility in the application of certain provisions of
this Zoning Code. It is the further purpose of this chapter:
   (a)    To produce a comprehensive development equal to or better than that
resulting from    traditional lot by lot land use development.
   (b)    To recognize the problems of population density, distribution and
circulation, and to allow a deviation from rigid established patterns of land
use, but controlled by defined policies and objectives.
   (c)    To permit flexibility of design in the placement and use of buildings
and open spaces, circulation facilities and off-street parking areas, and to
more efficiently utilize potentials of site characterized by special features
of geography, topography, size or shape.
   (d)   To obtain creative and coordinated designs harmonious and compatible
with surrounding uses.
1135.02 PLAN SUBMISSION.
   In any district, the owner of a tract of land comprising not less than 3
acres may submit to the Planning and Zoning Commission a plan for the use and
development of all of such tract for uses permitted in such district, or for
any uses permitted in any other district allowed hereunder if an underlying
zoning district change to such other district is also requested, the procedures
stated in Chapter
1109, Zoning Code Amendments, shall be followed. A development of land of less
than 3 acres may be accepted by the Planning and Zoning Commission if such land
is found to be suitable for a Planned Unit Development by virtue of its unique
historical character, topography or other natural features, or by virtue of its
qualifying as an isolated problem area.
   
1135.03 CONDITIONS FOR COMPLIANCE.
   It shall be the duty of the Planning and Zoning Commission to investigate
and determine that the proposed development plan complies with the following
conditions:
   (a)   General Intent. The plan is consistent with the intent and purpose of
this Zoning Code and the Deer Park Comprehensive Plan.
   (b)   Adjacent Effect. The property adjacent to the area included in the
plan will not be adversely affected.
   (c)   Lot Area Regulations. The minimum lot area contained in the
development, exclusive of the area of dedicated streets and rights of way, will
not be less than the lot area required in the district(s) in which the site is
located. The number of dwelling units per structure may vary where found to be
appropriate.
   (d)   Mixed Use Development. A plan for a mixture of uses (residential,
commercial, office, institutional, etc.) may be approved if the Planning and
Zoning Commission finds that the mixture of uses can be appropriately combined
within the design     of the plan and that the combination of uses is
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. The applicant must identify the use of
each area and the zoning district designated (i.e. R-1, MUB, PO, etc.) that is
the governing underlying zoning district. No use may be permitted that is not
identified as a permitted use within the zoning classification for the land use
being requested.
   (e)   Off-Street Parking. There are to be provided off-street parking
facilities in accordance with the requirements of the Off-Street Parking and
Loading Regulations chapter.
   (f)   Recreation. Indoor and/or outdoor recreation areas and facilities are
provided for and commensurate with the needs generated by the project.
1135.04 DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURES.
   (a)    Ownership and/or Control. The tract or tracts of land included in a
proposed Planned Unit Development must be in one ownership or control, or the
subject of a joint application by the owners of all the property included.
    (b)    Professional Design. The applicant for all proposed Planned Unit
Developments shall certify that the talents of the following professionals
shall be utilized in the planning process for the development:
      (1)   An architect licensed by any state;
      (2)   A landscape architect licensed in the State of Ohio, or a certified
urban planner holding an AICP designation; and
      (3)   A registered civil engineer and land surveyor, licensed by the
State of Ohio. One of the professional consultants chosen by the applicant
shall be designated to be responsible for conferring with the Planning and
Zoning Commission with respect to the concept and details of the plan. The
selection of the professional coordinator of the design team will not limit the
owner or the developer from consulting with City officials or the Planning and
Zoning Commission.
   (c)    District Regulations. The requirements as set forth in the underlying
zoning district regulations shall prevail except as modified in this chapter or
by the Planning and Zoning Commission. This chapter sets forth the requirements
for Planned Unit Developments and allows for the creation of a Planned Unit
Development district overlying the basic underlying zoning district or
districts in the tract involved in the Planned Unit Development.
   (d)    Zone Changes. The creation of a Planned Unit Development shall be
considered a zone change regardless of whether the underlying zoning
classification is changed or not. The developer may request a change of the
underlying zoning district in concurrence with the procedure set forth in this
Section, Preliminary Approval. The public hearings on such zoning change shall
be held at the same time as the public hearings required by Chapter
1109 No such change in the underlying zoning district or districts requested by
a developer or his or her representative shall take effect until final approval
of the preliminary plan is granted by City Council.
   (e)    Zoning or Building Permits. No zoning or building permits may be
issued until the final development plan is approved. Whenever such a Planned
Unit Development permit is granted, the Zoning District Map shall be clearly
marked to indicate that all tracts in any Planned Unit Development are in a
Planned Unit Development district overlying the basic zoning district.
1135.05 DEVELOPMENT CRITERIA.
The following development criteria are established to guide and control the
planning, development and use of land in a Planned Unit Development:
   (a)   Building and Use Arrangements. The design and development criteria set
forth in this section are intended to provide considerable latitude and freedom
in order to encourage variety in the arrangement of uses and of the location,
bulk and shape of buildings, open space and landscape features. Buildings and
uses shall be arranged, designed or located in order to screen and preserve
uses within and nearby the Planned Unit Development from adverse effects of
uses within or nearby the Planned Unit Development. The buildings and uses may
be arranged in various groups, courts, sequences or clusters with open spaces
organized and related to the buildings in order to provide privacy where
applicable, and to form a unified composition of buildings and space, and to
maximize the peace and tranquility of the residential occupants of the Planned
Unit Development and the nearby area, where applicable. The following design
standards shall be met in the Planned Unit Development area:
      (1)   That the adjoining property be protected from loss of light, air
and view because of the proximity or the bulk or shape of a building or
structure within the Planned Unit Development.
      (2)   That through skillful design, in Planned Unit Developments
containing     residential units, the usability and accessibility of open
spaces on adjoining lots be obtained, while privacy be assured within such
adjoining dwellings.
      (3)   That required yards and setbacks should not be excessive so as to
prevent the reasonable development of open land for landscape features,
recreation or other private or passive use; and
      (4)   That the latitude in design should also apply to the planning of
landscape     features such as walls, fences, hedges and other features to
create a variety of common open spaces and private areas.
   (b)   Local Circulation System. The vehicular circulation system and parking
facilities shall be designed to fully accommodate vehicular traffic with safety
and efficiency without allowing the same to dominate and destroy the form of
the area. Driveways for group developments and local streets shall be connected
to major arterial and collector streets at locations where the traffic can be
controlled and operated effectively with minimum interference with the capacity
of the major arterial and collector streets. The amount of traffic generated by
commercial uses passing through residential areas shall be minimized.
   (c)   Topography and Site Appearance. It is a requirement of this Zoning
Code that such developments shall be designed to take advantage of the
topography of the land in order to utilize the natural contours, to economize
on the construction of utilities to reduce the amount of grading and to
maximize the conservation of trees and topsoil. The natural features and other
distinctive characteristics of the site shall be integrated into the plan to
create functional variations in the arrangement of buildings, open spaces and
site features.
   (d)   Utility Services. Utility services in a Planned Unit Development area
shall be entirely underground.
   (e)   Private Land. In the planning of residential developments in a variety
of groups or clusters, private land should be provided adjacent to the units
for the private outdoor use of the occupants.
   (f)   Common Land. The common land shall be readily accessible and of such
condition, size, shape and form of ownership as to be usable for recreation or
appropriate for undeveloped open spaces. The integrity of the common land shall
be guaranteed from further division or other changes through deed restrictions
or declarations of covenants by explicit prohibition of other than intended
uses. Such deed restrictions and covenants shall be exempt from further
amendment except upon prior approval by Council.
   (g)   Unified Boundary. The design at the development area boundary shall be
unified with the adjoining development. Within the development area, extensive
parking areas, commercial areas and other features likely to have an adverse
effect on the surrounding property shall be screened against viewing from first
stories outside the development. Screening shall also be provided against
adverse views from the development against lights, noise or other undesirable
conditions on the surrounding areas outside the development.
   (h)   Surrounding Area. The Planned Unit Development shall be planned and
developed to harmonize with existing and proposed development in the area
adjacent to and surrounding the project site and shall be consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan.
1135.06 AREA AND DENSITY REGULATIONS.
   The various area, yard and height regulations of a Planned Unit Development
are defined and set forth as follows:
   (a)   Planned Unit Development Area Qualification. The minimum area to
qualify as a Planned Unit Development area shall not be less than three
contiguous acres. A parcel or parcels of land with less acreage may be
considered for planned development when it is demonstrated that such smaller
area has a unique feature of geography, topography or other development aspect
which is determined to be appropriate for such district designation. However,
contiguous property of less than three acres may be added to a previously
established Planned Unit Development without any demonstrated basis.
   (b)   Project Area. The project area that will be used to determine the
permitted number of units shall include all of the area within the Planned Unit
Development minus land located in an easement, land located within a floodway,
land allocated for public right-of-ways, and any additional land which the
Planning and Zoning Commission sees as being undevelopable.
   (c)   Development Densities. The maximum density of a development shall be
determined by dividing the project area, as defined in division (b) of this
section, by the minimum lot area required by the underlying zoning. Where the
Planned Unit Development lies over multiple zoning districts, the number of
allowable units must be calculated separately for each of the separate zoning
districts.
   (d)   Lot Area. When a developer demonstrates that it is necessary to use
lots that contain less than the minimum lot area or have less than the minimum
lot width required in the underlying zoning district, because either one of the
following conditions exist:
      (1)   Such use will create a distinctive residential setting that is in
harmony with the character of the surrounding developments; or
      (2)   The land to be developed is of a unique or unusual geographical or
topographical condition that restricts the use of lots meeting the minimum lot
area or lot width requirement; then the Planning and Zoning Commission may
approve such uses.
   (e)   Standards for an Increase in Density. The Planning and Zoning
Commission may recommend authorization of an increase in the density of a
Planned Unit Development under the following standards:
      (1)   For undeveloped green space above the minimum amount required, a
maximum increase of 5%.
      (2)   For improved green space or recreational space above the minimum
amount required, a maximum increase of 10%.
      (3)   For distinctiveness and excellence in siting, design and
landscaping, a maximum increase of 10%.
      (4)   At the discretion of the Planning and Zoning Commission and based
upon the conditions set forth in this subsection, project density may be
increased up to the a maximum amount of 25% of the underlying maximum density
figure.
   (f)   Controls on Density Increase. If the Planning and Zoning Commission
finds that any of the following conditions would be created by an increase in
density permitted in division (e) of this section, it may then use either of
the provisions listed in subsection (g) of this section:
      (1)   Inconvenient or unsafe access to the Planned Unit Development;
      (2)   Traffic congestion in the streets which adjoin the Planned Unit
Development; or
      (3)   An excessive burden on parks, recreational areas, schools and other
public facilities that serve or are proposed to serve the Planned Unit
Development.
   (g)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may use either of the following
provisions in order to control the conditions specified in division (e) of this
subsection:
      (1)   Prohibit any increase in density; or
      (2)   Limit the increase in density by an amount which is sufficient to
avoid the creation of any of these conditions.
   (h)   Minimum Dwelling Size. No reduction in the minimum dwelling size shall
be permitted.
1135.07 PERIPHERAL SETBACKS.
   Along the boundary of any Planned Unit Development, each non-residential
building shall be set back at least 25 feet from adjoining private property
outside the Planned Unit Development. Each residential building shall be set
back from adjoining residential buildings outside the Planned Unit Development
in accordance with the requirements for that district.
1135.08 REQUIRED OPEN SPACES.
   The Planned Unit Development will only be approved if the PUD development
plan contains areas to be allocated for green space and recreational space
which satisfies the standards governing the usability and quality of such
common spaces that are contained below:
   (a)   No open area may be accepted as green space and recreational space
under the     provisions of this Zoning Code unless it meets the following
standards:
      (1)   The location, shape, size and character of the green spaces and
recreational spaces shall be suitable for the Planned Unit Development.
   (b)   Recreational space shall be land that is designed for active
recreational uses such as tennis cours, playgrounds, hike and bike trails, and
swimming pools and shall comprise at least five percent (5%) of the total
project area. The uses authorized for the recreational space shall be
appropriate to the scale and character of the Planned Unit Development,
considering the size, density, expected population, including ages and number,
topography and the number and types of dwellings or uses to be provided. If the
underlying zoning district is Mixed Use Business, the more restrictive open
space requirements set forth in this Section shall apply.
   (c)   In addition to the recreational space, a minimum of ten percent (10%)
of the total project area shall be dedicated as green space. Such green space
shall be suitably improved for its intended use, but any green space containing
natural features worthy of preservation may be left unimproved. The buildings,
structures and improvements which are permitted in the green space shall be
appropriate to the uses which are authorized for the green space and shall
conserve and enhance the amenities of the green space, having regard to its
topography and unimproved condition. If the underlying zoning district is Mixed
Use Business, the more restrictive open space requirements set forth in this
Section shall apply.
   (d)   If the final development plan provides for buildings, structures or
improvements in the green space and recreational space, the developer shall
provide a bond of 100% of the City Engineer's estimate of the cost of those
improvements so that the buildings, structures and improvements will be
completed. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall release the bond or other
assurance when the buildings, structures or improvements have been completed
according to the development plan.
   (e)   All land shown on the final development plan as green space and
recreational space shall be conveyed under one of the following options:
      (1)   It may be conveyed to a public agency that will agree to maintain
the green space and recreational space and any buildings, structures or
improvements that have been placed on it.
      (2)   It may be conveyed to trustees provided in an indenture
establishing an     association or similar organization for the maintenance of
the planned residential development. The green space and recreational space
shall be conveyed to the trustees subject to covenants to be approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission which restrict the green space and recreational
space to the uses or extent of development specified on the final development
plan and which provide for the maintenance of the green space and recreational
space in a manner which assures its continuing use for its intended purpose.
   (f)   No green space and recreational space may be put to any use not
specified in the final development plan unless the final development plan has
been amended to permit that use. However, no change of use so authorized may be
considered as a waiver of any of the covenants limiting the uses of green space
and recreational space and all rights to enforce these covenants are expressly
reserved.
   (g)   If the green space and recreational space is not conveyed to a public
agency, either one of the following methods of enforcement may be provided.
      (1)   The legal right to develop the green space and recreational space
for those uses not specified in the final development plan may be conveyed to a
public agency.
      (2)   The restrictions governing the use, improvement and maintenance of
the green space and recreational space may be stated as conditions to the
conveyance of the green space and recreational space, the fee title to the
green space and recreational space to vest in a public agency, at its
discretion, in the event of a substantial default in the stated conditions.
      (3)   The covenants governing the use, improvement or maintenance of the
green space and recreational space may authorize a public agency to enforce
their provisions.
(h)   The Zoning Inspector shall not approve the zoning compliance on the
building permit for any building or structure shown on the final development
plan for any stage of the Planned Unit Development unless the green space and
recreational space allocated to that stage have been conveyed under one of the
options provide in division (e) of this section.

Development Plan (Stage Two); and Final Development Plan (Stage Three).
1135.11 COUNCIL ACTION.
   Council, may, on its own initiative or upon the recommendation of the
Planning and Zoning Commission, establish a Planned Unit Development. Nothing
contained within this chapter shall preclude Council from modifying any
regulations, standards or criteria prescribed by these Planned Unit Development
standards or any other Zoning Code section if Council determines the
regulation, standard or criterion is inapplicable because of the unique
condition of the development area. Any modifications or deviations of any
requirement of this Zoning Code shall be considered an individual “PUD Waiver”
and shall be listed separately in the PUD Ordinance. A brief explanation of the
nature of each PUD Waiver and the justification for granting each waiver shall
be provided in the Ordinance.

recreational space, and population densities per net acre and gross acre
contemplated by the applicant.
   (b)   The developer shall meet with the Planning and Zoning Commission and
any members of the City or County the Zoning Inspector deems necessary to
determine whether the requirements of this Section have been complied with. The
applicant must indicate his or her professional design team, as outlined in
this Section, and also designate who is to be his or her professional
coordinator.
   (c)    The professional coordinator shall be responsible for presenting the
developer's plan in all the broad professional aspects to the Planning and
Zoning Commission. If satisfactory agreement is reached, the applicant may
proceed to prepare data for Stage Two, Preliminary Approval.
1135.13 PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN (STAGE TWO).
   (a)    Preliminary Action by Planning and Zoning Commission. An application
for a Planned Unit Development permit shall be considered by the Planning and
Zoning Commission. A public hearing shall be held on each such application.
After such hearing, the Commission    shall determine whether the proposal
conforms to the criteria set forth in this Chapter and shall issue a
recommendation to Council and may recommend the inclusion of such conditions of
approval as are in its judgment necessary to ensure conformity to such criteria
and regulations. In so doing, the Commission may, in its description, recommend
submission of the final development plan in stages, corresponding to different
units or elements of the development. It may do so only upon evidence assuring
completion of the entire development in accordance with the preliminary
development plan and stage development schedule.
   (b)    Council Action. After the Planning and Zoning Commission has issued a
recommendation to Council, the application will be referred to City Council.
Council will hold a public hearing. After this hearing, and if approved by
Council, the Planned Unit Development permit shall be issued by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer.
1135.14 FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN (STAGE THREE).
   (a)    Generally. Within one year after the approval or modified approval of
a preliminary development plan, the applicant shall file with the Planning and
Zoning Commission a final construction plan for the entire development, or when
submission in stages has been authorized pursuant to this Chapter for the first
unit of the development. The final plan shall conform in all respects to the
approved preliminary development plan. The final plan shall include all
information included in the preliminary plan plus the following:
      (1)   The location and size of water, sewerage and drainage facilities;
      (2)   Detailed building and landscaping plans and elevations;

receipt of the final development plan, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
submit the plan to the City Engineer and the City Manager for reports regarding
water, sewerage and drainage, and street improvement plans. The Commission
shall examine such plan and determine whether it conforms to all applicable
criteria and standards and whether it conforms in all substantial respects to
the previously approved Planned Unit Development permit, or require such
changes in the proposed development. or impose such conditions of approval as
are in its judgment necessary to insure conformity to the applicable criteria
and standards. In so doing, the Commission may permit the applicant to revise
the plan and resubmit it as a final development plan within thirty (30) days of
such action.
1135.15 PUD PERMIT CRITERIA.
   A Planned Unit Development permit may be granted by Council only if it is
found that the development conforms to all of the following criteria provided
for in this Chapter:
   (a)   That the location, design, size and uses are consistent with the Deer
Park Zoning Map, and with other applicable plans or development plans adopted
by the Planning and Zoning Commission or Council, or ordinance adopted by
Council.
   (b)   That the location, design and size are such that the development can
be well integrated with its surroundings.
   (c)   That the location, design and size are such that traffic generated by
the development can be accommodated safely and without congestion on existing
or planned arterial or collector streets.
   (d)   That the location, design, size and uses are such that residents will
be adequately served by existing or planned facilities and services, and the
total development will result in an attractive, healthful, efficient and stable
environment for living.
1135.16 LIMITATION ON RE-SUBMISSION.
   Whenever an application for a Planned Unit Development has been denied, no
application for the same area, or any portion thereof, shall be filed by the
same applicant within six (6) months after the date of denial.
1135.17 COMPLIANCE WITH APPROVED PLAN.
   The applicant shall agree in writing to be bound, for himself or herself and
his or her successors in interest, by the conditions prescribed for approval of
a development. The approved final plan and stage development schedule shall
control the issuance of all building permits and shall restrict the nature,
location and design of all uses. Minor changes in an approved preliminary or
final development plan may be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission if
such changes are consistent with the purposes and general character of the
development plan. All other modifications, including extensions or revisions of
the stage development schedule, shall be processed in the same manner as the
original application and shall be subject to the same procedural requirements.
1135.18 PUD PERMIT REVOCATION.
   (a)    In the event of failure to comply with the approved plan or any
prescribed condition of approval, including failure to comply with the stage
development schedule, Council, acting upon the recommendation of the Planning

   Notes:
      (1)   Side yard and rear yard setbacks shown in this chart may be
modified by the bufferyard requirements set forth in Chapter
1143 .
 
      (2)   Minimum required front yard setbacks in any residential zoning
district may be reduced to conform to existing neighborhood characteristics
when adjacent land has been developed with smaller front setbacks.
Specifically, when a parcel is proposed to be developed or redeveloped and
existing principle structures on either side of the subject property have
setbacks that are lesser distances than would be normally required, then the
applicable setback for the subject property may be reduced by an amount that
would not exceed the average of those existing structures within 1000 feet of
the subject property (on the same side of the street).  This determination
shall be made by the Zoning Inspector without the need for a variance.
 
      (3)   New construction projects in the MUB zoning district shall provide
for a minimum 8' front yard setback for the reservation of outdoor dining
space.
         (Ord. 2023-06. Passed 5-1-23.)
1137.02 SUPPLEMENTAL YARD AND HEIGHT REGULATIONS.
   In addition to all yard regulations specified in other sections of this
Zoning Code, the provisions included in this section shall be used for
interpretation and clarification.
   (a)   Yard Setback Requirements for Corner Buildings. On a corner lot in any
district, the main building and any accessory structures shall be required to
have the same setback distance from all street right-of-way lines as required
for the front yard in the district in which such structures are located. The
remaining yards shall be considered side yards. (See the illustration below)

   (b)   Visibility at Intersections. On a corner lot in any district, nothing
shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to
materially impede vision between a height of 2½ feet and 10 feet above the
center line grades of the intersecting streets in the area bounded by the
right-of-way of such corner lots and a line joining points along the right-of-
way 25 feet from the point of intersection.
   (c)   Accessory Structures. Side yard and rear yard setbacks for accessory
structures is provided for in Chapter
1147 .

1139.01  CONDITIONS FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   In order to administer the provisions of this Zoning Code and to evaluate
site plans in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare,
this Chapter shall apply to new property development and any collective
substantial expansion of existing structures, new or expanded parking lots
consisting of the creation of one new parking space or more in any zoning
district. The construction of individual single-family dwellings and two-family
dwellings (duplexes) shall be exempt from the site plan review requirement.
Substantial expansion of existing structures shall be defined based on the
criteria established below:
When Existing Structure is....    A Substantial Expansion is....
 
0 - 1,000 Sq. Ft.         50% or Greater   
1,001 - 10,000 Sq. Ft.      40% or Greater
10,001 - 25,000 Sq. Ft.      30% or Greater
25,001 - 50,000 Sq. Ft.      20% or Greater
50,001 Sq. Ft. and larger      10% or Greater
 
   Furthermore, no building shall be erected or structurally altered on any lot
or parcel in cases where a site plan review is required, except in accordance
with the regulations of this section and all other applicable sections within
this Zoning Code and an approved site plan. No zoning permit shall be issued
prior to the approval of a site plan.
1139.02 PROCEDURE FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)   Formal submission and approval of a site plan is required before any
zoning permit may be issued. Formal submission and approval of a site plan
includes following the review procedures and submission requirements defined
herein.  Notwithstanding these requirements, however, at any time prior to the
formal submission and review of a site plan, an applicant may at his or her
option, submit a sketch site plan for informal review and comment. The purpose
of such a sketch site plan is to provide an opportunity to conceptually discuss
a proposed development and to provide general guidance to assist in the
preparation of a formal site plan. A sketch site plan need not include all
items required for a formal site plan application and informal review of the
site plan need not include the notifications required under this section.
   (b)   An applicant for formal site plan approval shall file twelve copies of
a plan with the Zoning Inspector along with other required documents and an
application fee. For developments also requiring conditional use approval, the
procedure established in Chapter
1149 shall be followed. The Planning and Zoning Commission may concurrently
address the issue of site plan approval and conditional use approval.
   (c)   After reviewing an application for formal site plan approval for
completeness and determining that the application and site plan is complete,
the Zoning Inspector shall transmit copies of the site plan to individual
departments and agencies. If all information required is not provided, the
Zoning Inspector shall promptly notify the applicant of the items needed.
Within 30 days following the determination that the application is complete,
one of the following actions shall be taken:
      (1)   Approval of the site plan based upon a determination that the
proposed plan will constitute a suitable development and the plan meets the
standards set forth in this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Disapproval of the site plan based upon a determination that the
proposed project does not meet the standards for review set forth in all
applicable Chapters of this zoning ordinance.
      (3)   Approval of the site plan subject to any conditions, modifications,
and    restrictions as required to guaranty that the project meets the
standards for review.
      (4)   Table the site plan application for a period not to exceed ninety
(90) days to provide the applicant additional time to address one or more
deficiencies identified in the site plan application.
   (d)    If the site plan is disapproved, the specific basis for such
disapproval shall be provided, along with a clear description of how the site
plan could be modified to be approved. Appeals from Commission decisions may be
made in the manner specified in Chapter
1105.
   (e)   Submission Requirements. A site plan shall be prepared at a scale of
one inch equals 20 feet (developments more than five acres may be drawn at a
scale of one inch equals 50 feet), on standard 24-inch x 36-inch sheets with
continuation on 8½-inch x 11-inch sheets as necessary for narrative. A site
plan shall, at a minimum, include all data, details, and supporting information
as outlined in this Chapter. A site plan review fee pursuant to the fee
schedule adopted by City Council shall be required to defray the expenses
associated with the public review of the plans, including the need to retain a
registered professional engineer, architect, landscape architect, or other
professional consultant to advise the city on any or all aspects of the site
plan.
1139.03 STANDARDS FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)   Standards for review. Site plans shall be reviewed in accordance to
the following criteria:
      (1)   Traffic. Convenience and safety of both vehicular and pedestrian
movement within the site and in relationship to adjoining ways and properties.
      (2)   Parking. Provisions for the off-street loading and unloading of
vehicles     incidental to the normal operation of the establishment; adequate

employees.
         B.   Maximum seating capacity, where applicable.
         C.   Number of parking spaces existing and required for the intended
use.
1139.05 OUTDOOR LIGHTING STANDARDS.
   The outdoor lighting guidelines shall apply to all new projects and
qualified expansion projects subject to this site plan review process.
    (a)   Lighting must be placed and shielded so as to direct the light onto
the site and away from adjoining properties. The lighting source shall not be
directly visible from adjoining properties. Floodlights, wall pack units, other
types of unshielded lights, and lights where the lens is visible outside of the

1139.06 ACCESS CONTROL REQUIREMENTS.
   General standards for parking areas, circulation, and access shall be
incorporated as part of the site plan. These standards are found in Chapter
1141. As part of the site plan review process, access shall be reviewed
relative to the distance from other drive approaches and from roadway
intersections. The preferred method of providing access to parcels is to
minimize or eliminate driveways by using service roads, rear access roads, or
shared driveways. The Planning and Zoning Commission may, as part of the site
plan review process, require that existing driveways be moved, combined, re-
aligned, or eliminated to reduce the potential for accidents.
   (a)   Conditional Approval of Driveways. As part of the site plan review
process, the Planning and Zoning Commission may approve a site plan with a
specific driveway location with the condition that an agreement be first
entered into between the property owner and the city, requiring that if a
service road is constructed in the future, or if the opportunity for a shared
driveway should present itself with development of adjacent property, one or
more approved driveways shall be closed and measurements taken to utilize such
service road or shared drive. Approval of driveways may also include
restrictions on turning movements, locations, or other requirements to ensure
safe and efficient traffic movement
   (b)   Construction and use of service roads. When a service road is
required, such    improvement shall be constructed by the developer of the
involved property before any occupancy or use of the parcel or structure is
permitted. When a service road is provided, all access to an adjacent property
shall use that service road and no direct access to the main thoroughfare shall
be provided.
1139.07 TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY.
   A traffic impact study shall be a requirement for site plan review if the
expected trip generation of the land use is 100 or more cars per hour as
identified in the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) Manual. A traffic impact
study shall be prepared by a qualified professional engineer registered in the
State of Ohio at the developer's expense. The traffic impact study shall
investigate the feasibility and benefits of improvements such as signals, turn
lanes, driveway movement limitations, and other relevant information to the
site to protect the safety of the traveling public. The traffic impact study
shall include the following elements:
   (a)   A description of the site and study area.
   (b)   Anticipated development of adjacent parcels.
   (c)   Trip generation and distribution, including a description of all
assumptions used to generate findings of trip distribution.
   (d   Modal split, if applicable.
   (e)   Traffic assignment resulting from the development.
   (f)   Projected future traffic volumes.
   (g)   An assessment of the impact that would result from driveway
alternatives.
   (h)   Recommendations for site access and transportation improvements needed
to maintain traffic flow within and past the site at an acceptable and safe
level of service.
   (i)   An evaluation of the effects the proposed development will have on the
level of service and roadway capacity.
1139.08 CONFORMITY TO AN APPROVED SITE PLAN.
   Property subject to site plan approval must be developed in strict
compliance with the approved site plan, inclusive of any amendments, which have
received the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (a)   If construction and development does not conform with the approved
site plan, the approval of the site plan shall be revoked by the Zoning
Inspector by written notice of the revocation being posted upon the premises
involved, and mailed to the owner at his last known address. Upon revocation of
this approval, all construction activities shall cease upon the site until the
time the violation has been corrected or the Planning and Zoning Commission
has, upon a proper site plan application being filed by the owner, approved a
modification to the site plan to coincide with the owner's construction, or
altered plans for construction to be in compliance with the criteria contained
in the site plan approval provisions and with the spirit, purpose, and intent
of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Approval of the site plan shall be valid for a period of one (1) year
beginning from the date of Planning and Zoning Commission approval. If a
building permit has not been obtained and substantial on-site development
actually commenced within one (1) year, the site plan approval shall become
void and a new application for site plan approval shall be required and new
approval obtained before any construction or site preparation work is commenced
upon the site.
   (c)   Enforcement. The city shall require the posting of a surety bond or
other similar performance guarantee to ensure that required infrastructure
improvements within the public right-of-way are completed in the event that the
project is abandoned.  The city may suspend the zoning permit when work is not
performed as required by an approved site plan.
1139.09 AMENDMENT TO AN APPROVED SITE PLAN.
   (a)    Minor changes to approved final plans may be approved by the Zoning
Inspector, provided such changes comply with all applicable requirements of
this Zoning Code and all other federal, state, county or township laws and
regulations.
   (b)    Major changes must be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission
for review in the same manner as the original application was submitted or
reviewed. Major changes include:
      (1)   Increases in the scope or density of land use, land area, or
building size;
      (2)    The addition of uses and/or buildings not authorized by the
original approval;
      (3)    The rearrangement of lot lines or building locations by more than
five (5) feet;
      (4)    Changes in the character or function of access drives;
      (5)    Significant changes in the concept of the development; or
      (6)    Any changes which the Zoning Inspector refuses or fails to
approve.

maximum dimensions of the display area if posted on a common background. The
following standards shall be used to determine the area and height measurements
for all signs erected or posted within the City:
      (1)   The area of a sign shall be computed by means of the smallest
square area that will encompass the exterior display limits of a sign, but not
including the supporting frame or bracing as described in the illustration

adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point.
      (3)   In the case of irregularly shaped three dimensional signs, the area
of the display surface shall be measured on the plane of the largest vertical
cross section.
      (4)   The height of a sign shall be determined by measuring the vertical
distance between the highest point of the sign to the ground elevation at the
base of the sign. If mounding was used at the sign base, the ground elevation
shall be determined as the average ground elevation of the developed site at
the sign base prior to mounding.

1149.01 PURPOSE.
   Most types of land uses covered by this Zoning Code are grouped according to
compatibility and function, and each group is permitted outright in one or more
of the various districts established in the Zoning Code. In addition to these
permitted uses, there are other uses which it may be necessary or desirable to
allow in certain districts but because of their potential impact on adjacent
land or public facilities, require particular and individual consideration
prior to location in the community. Such uses are classified in this Zoning
Code as "conditional uses."
1149.02 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT APPLICATION.
Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a conditional use is
proposed, shall make an application for a conditional use permit by filing it
with the Zoning Inspector. Any application for a conditional use shall be
accompanied by the following contents.
   (a)   Name, address, and phone number of the applicant;
   (b)   A legal description of the property;
   (c)   A detailed description of the existing use and proposed use;
   (d)   The zoning district in which it is located;
   (e)   A narrative statement evaluating the effects on adjoining property;
the effect of those elements such as noise, glare, odor, fumes, and vibration
on adjoining property; a discussion of the general compatibility with adjacent
and other properties in the district;
   (f)   If a proposed conditional use meets the requirements for a site plan
application submission as provided for in Chapter
1139, the conditional use application shall also contain those site plan
application requirements.
1149.03 PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   After reviewing the conditional use permit application and determining that
the application is complete, the Zoning Inspector shall transmit copies of the
application to the Planning and Zoning Commission, along with other agencies
and organizations deemed necessary. If all information required is not
provided, the Zoning Inspector shall promptly notify the applicant of the items
needed. Within 30 days following the determination that the application is
complete, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing.
Notice of such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general
circulation in the city at least ten days before the date of said hearing. The
notice shall set forth the time and place of the hearing and shall provide a
summary explanation of the conditional use proposed. Notice of this public
hearing shall also be sent to all owners of property within 300 feet of the
property in question. Following the hearing, but within 30 days after the
determination that the application is complete, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall make a decision. The decision may be appealed by any
interested party in writing to the Board of Zoning Appeals if such appeal is
received within 30 days following the decision of the Planning and Zoning
Commission. The written appeal must be filed with the Zoning Inspector. On
receipt of the written appeal, the BZA shall discuss the appeal at a public
hearing and shall make a decision whether to grant the conditional use based on
the standards set forth in Chapter
1105.
1149.04 GENERAL STANDARDS FOR ALL CONDITIONAL USES.

1151.01 NONCONFORMING USE STANDARDS.
   (a)   The lawful use of any dwelling, building, or structure on any lot or
premises existing and lawful at the time of the enactment of this Zoning Code,
supplement, or amendment may continue although such use does not conform with
the provisions of this Zoning Code or any supplement or amendment made after
the enactment of this Zoning Code. A nonconforming use of a building may be
changed to another nonconforming use of the same or more restricted
classification.
   (b)   In the event that a nonconforming use of any dwelling, building, or
structure and of any lot or premises is voluntarily discontinued for a
continuous period of six (6) months, any future use of the lot, building, or
structure shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (c)   No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole or in
part to any other location on the lot, or to any other property, unless every
portion of such building or structure is made to conform to all the regulations
of the zone in which it is located.
   (d)   When a nonconforming building or structure has been damaged by
explosion, fire, act of God, or the public enemy to the extent of more than 60%
of its fair market value, it shall not be restored or reconstructed except in
conformity with regulations of this Zoning Code.
   (e)   When a nonconforming use qualifies for reconstruction through damage
(less than 60% of its fair market value), a building permit shall be secured
for that purpose and reconstruction shall be diligently completed without
delay. Failure to reconstruct within one (1) year of damage revokes the right
to the nonconforming use and the premises shall conform thereafter to the
established district regulations.
   (f)    A structure or building nonconforming as to use, height and yard
requirements or lot area per dwelling unit shall not be added to or enlarged in
any manner unless such structure or building, including such addition or
enlargement, is made to conform to the use, height, yard and area requirements
of this Zoning Code.
1151.02  NONCONFORMING RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES.
   If any residential structure was built prior to the adoption of this Zoning
Code and is considered to have nonconforming setbacks, additions to, or
enlargements of an existing structure which presently encroach upon required
side or rear yards may be permitted if the proposed addition or enlargement
follows the existing structure setbacks and the addition or enlargement will
not exceed any other lot lines.
1151.03 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (a)   In a district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Zoning Code, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
Zoning Code. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous
frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even
though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that
are generally applicable in the district.
   (b)   If two or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this Zoning Code, and if all or part of the lots with no buildings
do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands
involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this
Zoning Code, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner
which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by
this Zoning Code, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a
lot with a width or area below the requirements stated in this Zoning Code.
1151.04 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, at the time of adoption of this Chapter lawful uses of land exist
which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Chapter, the
uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided:
        (a)   No nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter;
      (b)    No such nonconforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to
any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by those uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter;
   (c)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
Chapter shall be created in connection with a nonconforming use of land.

strengthening or restoring to a safe and sanitary condition of any building or
part thereof declared to be unsafe or unsanitary by the Zoning Inspector or any
other official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of that
official.

shall be constructed or operated so as to create a nuisance or to create any
noxious, objectionable or other undesirable effect on persons or property
outside of the lot line of said use. Materials, uses and products produced
shall be adequately housed, shielded or screened so that the health, safety and
welfare of persons occupying the property or adjacent properties are not
jeopardized.
   (a)   Applicability and Compliance. The performance standards are applicable
to all land uses in all zoning districts within the City, and both initial and
continued compliance is required. Any condition or land use falling under the
jurisdiction of the standards of this Zoning Code and not in conformance with
these standards shall be brought into full compliance immediately upon
discontinuance of the existing use of land, structure or building. Any change
in the principal use of land, a structure or a building shall constitute a
discontinuance and be fully subject to these standards and provisions.
   (b)   Noise. No business or commercial operation or residential use shall
create a persistent or recurring noise which is a nuisance. No business or
commercial operation or residential use may raise the noise level more than two
decibels above the normal background level (measured at any lot line).
   (c)   Odors. No use shall cause or allow the emission of odorous air
contaminants    from any source sufficient to result in detectable odors beyond
any lot line on which the use occurs.
   (d)   Vibrations. Every use shall be so operated that ground vibration
inherently and    recurrently generated is not perceptible, without
instruments, at any point on or outside the property line of the property on
which the use is located.
   (e)   Glare and Heat. Any operation producing intense light or heat,
including high    temperature processes such as combustion or welding, shall
not be visible or felt beyond any lot line bounding the property wherein the
use is conducted. All exterior lighting on private property shall be positioned
as to extend glare away from adjacent properties or public right-of-ways.
   (f)   Air and Water Pollutants. The emission of air and water pollutants
shall not violate the standards and regulations of any local, State or Federal
agency having jurisdiction in this matter.
   (g)   Hazardous Materials. The storage, utilization and manufacture of
solid, liquid and gaseous chemicals and other materials shall be permitted
subject to the standards and regulation of any local, State or Federal agency
having jurisdiction in this matter.
   (h)   Smoke. The emission of smoke or dust by any land use in an amount
sufficient to create a general nuisance to adjoining properties shall be
prohibited.
   (i)   Enforcement. In enforcing Performance Standards on existing uses, the
Zoning    Inspector may issue a written Notice of Violation to an alleged
violator. The Zoning Inspector shall, before issuing such Notice, make
technical determinations of any   probable violation when such determinations
can be made using equipment and trained personnel normally available to the
City or obtainable without extraordinary expense. In other cases, however,
technical complexity or extraordinary expense may make it unreasonable for the
City to maintain personnel or equipment for making determinations of violation
prior to issuing a Notice of Violation. In such cases, a Notice of Violation
may be issued when the Zoning Inspector has other reason to believe there is
probable violation. The Zoning Inspector shall give Notice of Violation by any
means that ensures a signed receipt for such notice to the party responsible
for the alleged violation. The notice shall describe the alleged violation and
the results of technical determinations or the other reasons why the Zoning
Inspector believes there is a violation.
      (1)   Notice contents. The notice shall require either an answer or
correction of the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning Inspector
and within a time limit he or she shall specify in the Notice. The Notice shall
also state that failure to provide an answer or correct the alleged violation
within this time limit shall constitute admission of a violation. The Notice
shall further state that, if technical determinations have not already been
made, upon request of the alleged violator such determinations will be made. If
a violation is found as a result of such determinations, the cost of the
determinations will be assessed against the properties or parties responsible
in addition to any other penalties provided for. If no violation is found, the
City shall pay the cost of the determinations.
1153.09 MOBILE STORAGE STRUCTURES.
   (a)    A portable on-demand storage structure may be utilized as a temporary
structure within the city when in compliance with the standards of this
subsection upon the issuance of a Temporary Structure Permit from the City
Zoning Inspector. Any use of such structures within the city not in compliance
with this subsection shall be unlawful.
   (b)    The term "portable on-demand storage structures" (POD) shall be
defined to be: any container, storage unit, shed-like container or other
portable structure that can or is used for the storage of personal property of
any kind and which is located for such purposes outside an enclosed building
other than an accessory building or shed complying with all building codes and
land use requirements.
   (c)    POD Standards.
      (1)   A POD storage structure may be located as a temporary structure on
property within the city for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days in
duration from time of delivery to time of removal. A POD structure shall not be
located in the front yard of any lot within the city.
      (2)   Permit required. Permits for such temporary uses and structures may
be issued   by the Zoning Inspector after submission of a completed Temporary
Storage Structure Permit Application and payment of the permit application fee.
An approved permit is valid for the specified 30 day time frame only. Such POD
structure may not be located on a specific property more than three (3) times
in any given calendar year period. Applicants seeking to extend the time frame
consistent with the provisions in this subsection must complete a new
application and submit a new permit application fee payment for each time
period sought. No POD may be stored for more than a continuous 90 day period.
      (3)   No more than one (1) POD storage structures may be located on a
specific piece of property within the city at one time;
      (4)   Such structure may not exceed eight feet six inches in height, 10
feet in width or 20 feet in length.
      (5)   All such temporary structures shall comply with the appropriate
building code provisions and such other requirements as are imposed by the City
or the Chief Building Official to ensure the safety of the public.
   (d)   It shall be the obligation of the owner of the property which the POD
is located or the user of such temporary structure to secure it in a manner
that does not endanger the safety of persons or property in the vicinity of the
temporary structure. In the event of high winds or other weather conditions in
which such structure may become a physical danger to persons or property, the
appropriate law enforcement officers may require the immediate removal of such
temporary structure.
   (e)    Any portable on-demand storage structure which is not removed at the
end of the time for which it may lawfully remain in place, or immediately upon
the direction of a law enforcement officer for removal of such temporary
structure for safety reasons, may be removed by the city immediately, without
notice, and the cost of such removal, together with the cost of administration
of its removal, may be assessed against the property on which the temporary
structure was located and may be filed as a lien against such property by the
City. Such lien shall be superior in priority to all other liens or
encumbrances upon the property, including the lien of a mortgage, and shall be
equal in priority to the lien of ad valorem taxes.
1153.10 PARKING AND STORAGE OF UTILITY TRAILERS.
   The parking or storage of utility trailers within the front yard area of a
lot is prohibited in any residential zoning district. Utility trailers shall be
defined as any trailer used to transport work related or non-work related

   (t)    Failure to abide by the conditions outlined above may be grounds for
revocation of the special use permit for the tower.
   (u)    There shall be a pre-application meeting. The purpose of the pre-
application meeting will be to address issues which will help to expedite the
review and permitting process. A pre-application meeting shall also include a
site visit if there has not been a prior site visit for the requested site.
Costs of the City's consultants to prepare for and attend the pre-application
meeting will be borne by the applicant.
   (v)    The holder of a special use permit shall notify the City of any
intended modification of a wireless telecommunication facility and shall apply
to the City to modify, relocate or rebuild a wireless telecommunications
facility.
   (w)    In order to better inform the public, in the case of a new
telecommunication tower, the applicant shall, prior to the public hearing on
the application, hold a balloon test. The applicant shall arrange to fly, or
raise upon a temporary mast, a minimum of a 3-foot in diameter brightly colored
balloon at the maximum height of the proposed new tower. The dates, (including
a second date, in case of poor visibility on the initial date) times and
location of this balloon test shall be advertised by the applicant 7 and 14
days in advance of the first test date in a newspaper with a general
circulation in the City. The applicant shall inform the City, in writing, of
the dates and times of the test, at least 14days in advance. The balloon shall
be flown for at least four consecutive hours sometime between 7:00 a.m. and 4:
00 p.m. on the dates chosen. The primary date shall be on a weekend, but in
case of poor weather on the initial date, the secondary date maybe on a
weekday.
   (x)    The applicant will provide a written copy of an analysis, completed
by a qualified individual or organization, to determine if the tower or
existing structure intended to support wireless facilities requires lighting
under Federal Aviation Administration Regulation Part 77. This requirement
shall be for any new tower or for an existing structure or building where the
application increases the height of the structure or   building. If this
analysis determines that the FAA must be contacted, then all filings with the
FAA, all responses from the FAA, and any related correspondence shall be
provided in a timely manner.
1155.05 LOCATION.
   (a)    Applicants for wireless telecommunications facilities shall locate,
site and erect said wireless telecommunications facilities in accordance with
the following priorities, (1)being the highest priority and (3) being the
lowest priority.
      (1)   On existing towers or other structures without increasing the
height of the tower   or structure;
      (2)   On City-owned properties located in any zoning district;
      (3)   On properties in areas zoned for (PO) planned office use;
   (b)    If the proposed site is not proposed for the highest priority listed
above, then a detailed explanation must be provided as to why a site of a
higher priority was not selected. The person seeking such an exception must
satisfactorily demonstrate the reason or reasons why such a permit should be
granted for the proposed site, and the hardship that would be incurred by the
applicant if the permit were not granted for the proposed site.
   (c)    An applicant may not by-pass sites of higher priority by stating the
site proposed is the only site leased or selected. An application shall address
co-location as an option. If such option is not proposed, the applicant must
explain to the reasonable satisfaction of the City why co-location is
commercially or otherwise impracticable. Agreements between providers limiting
or prohibiting co-location shall not be a valid basis for any claim of
commercial impracticability or hardship.
   (d)    Notwithstanding the above, the City may approve any site located
within an area in the above list of priorities, provided that the City finds
that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety and
welfare of the City and its inhabitants, and will not have a deleterious effect
on the nature and character of the community and neighborhood.
   (e)    The applicant shall submit a written report demonstrating the
applicant's review of the above locations in order of priority, demonstrating
the technological reason for the site selection. If appropriate, based on
selecting a site of lower priority, a detailed written explanation as to why
sites of a higher priority were not selected shall be included with the
application.
   (f)    Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of
highest priority or highest available priority, the City may disapprove an
application for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements;
      (2)   Conflict with the historic nature or character of a neighborhood;
      (3)   The use or construction of wireless telecommunications facilities
which is contrary to an already stated purpose of a specific zoning or land use
designation;
      (4)   The placement and location of wireless telecommunications
facilities which would create an unacceptable risk, or the reasonable
probability of such, to residents, the public, employees and agents of the
City, or employees of the service provider or other service providers;
      (5)   Conflicts with the provisions of this Chapter.

construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official

1302.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)    Buildings which remain vacant and unoccupied for any appreciable
period of time may become an attractive nuisance to children, a harbor for
rodents and vermin, an invitation to vagrants and criminals as a temporary
abode, an increased fire hazard, and the unkempt grounds surrounding such
property invite the dumping of garbage and rubbish thereon.
   (b)    The use and maintenance of property in such condition and manner
endangers the public health and safety, and constitutes an unreasonable use and
condition to the annoyance and discomfort of a considerable number of the
public. Vacant properties are detrimental to the public good and common
welfare, rendering a considerable number of citizens insecure in the use and
enjoyment of their property, and thus such properties constitute a nuisance
condition. (Ord. 2024-03. Passed 2-19-24.)
