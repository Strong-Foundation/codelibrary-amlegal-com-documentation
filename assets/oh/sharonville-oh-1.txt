ADOPTING ORDINANCE NO. 79-53
AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES; TO REPEAL
ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH; TO PUBLISH THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER, AND
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
WHEREAS,    the present general and permanent ordinances of the City of
Sharonville, are inadequately arranged and classified and are insufficient in
form and substance for the complete preservation of the public peace, property,
health, safety and welfare of the City and for the proper conduct of its
affairs; and
WHEREAS,    Council has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.
Drane Company to prepare and publish a new codification; and
WHEREAS,    the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
Council;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SHARONVILLE,
HAMILTON COUNTY, OHIO:
Section I.   That the ordinances of the City of Sharonville, Ohio, of a general
and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Sharonville, Ohio, 1979.
      One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as
correct by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this ordinance as a
part hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the City of
Sharonville, Ohio.
Section II.   That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect from and
immediately after passage of this Ordinance and its approval by the Mayor. All
ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof, which are inconsistent with any
provision of the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective
date of this Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
(b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege.
      (2)    The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property.
      (3)    The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment.
      (4)    The assumption of any contract or obligation.
      (5)    The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness.
      (6)    The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges.
      (7)    The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street
or public way.
      (8)    The dedication of property or plat approval.
      (9)    The annexation or detachment of territory.
      (10)    Any legislation enacted subsequent to January 1, 1979.
Section III.   That the Clerk of Council, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.23, shall
cause to be published in a manner required by law a summary of the new matter
contained in the Codified Ordinances. All sections of the Codified Ordinances
without a previous ordinance or resolution history at the end thereof indicate
that the section contains new matter ordained by this Adopting Ordinance.
Section IV.   This Ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure immediately
necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare, and
for the additional reason that there exists an imperative necessity for the
earliest publication and distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the
officials and citizens of the City, so as to facilitate administration, daily
operation and avoid practical and legal entanglements; wherefore, this
Ordinance shall be in full force and effect immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

         B.   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last

   (a)    The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein. (ORC
1.57)
   (b)    An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance. (ORC 1.54)
   (c)    The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not,
except as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)    Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)    Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)    Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)    Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re- enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance

   101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)    A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re- enactments or amendments thereof. (ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included. (ORC 1.56)
   (c)    Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
   101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)    If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)    If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevails. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)    (1)    If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
       (2)    If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)    In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)    Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)    The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
   (b)    An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)    If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)    The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history;
      (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance. (ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. (ORC l.50)
   101.09 MEETINGS OPEN TO PUBLIC.
   It is hereby declared to be the policy of the City of Sharonville that all
meetings of the City Council, the Planning Commission and the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall comply with Ohio's open meeting law as follows:
   (a)    All regular and special meetings shall be open to the public and
notice of special meetings shall be given to required newspapers at least
twenty-four hours prior to the meeting. Committees, other than a committee of
the whole, shall be exempt from the operation of this provision unless the
committee contains a majority of the members of the Council, Planning
Commission or Board of Zoning Appeals, as the case may be. The Council Law
Committee, as long as it does not contain more than three members, is exempt
from this provision.
   (b)    Executive sessions may be held only after a majority of the members
of the Council, Commission or Board vote to adjourn to executive session with
the motion thereon stating the specific exempt purpose for the executive
session.
   (c)    The purposes of executive sessions shall be limited to the following:
the purchase or sale of public property; the appointment, employment,
dismissal, discipline, promotion, demotion or compensation of a public employee
or official, or the investigation of charges or complaints against a public
official or employee, unless the specific employee requests a public meeting;
conferences with an attorney relative to disputes which involve or may involve
litigation; discussions regarding public employees, their compensation and
other conditions of employment; matters required by State or Federal law to be
kept confidential; matters which must be kept confidential in order to avoid
the commission of illegal acts or the avoidance of prosecution for illegal
acts.
   (d)    Minutes shall be kept for all executive sessions which shall contain
the record of the vote to hold the executive session and which describes which
of the exempt purposes was invoked. (Ord. 88-73. Passed 12-27-88.)
   101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is

CHAPTER 103
Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.

a.   The primary objective shall be the preservation of capital and protection
of principal while earning investment interest.
b.   In investing public funds, the Treasurer will strive to exceed or at least
equal the market average rate of return on the investment portfolio over the
course of budgetary and economic cycles taking into account State law, safety
considerations and cash flow requirements.
c.   The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to enable the
Treasurer to meet reasonable anticipated operating requirements.
d.   The investments portfolio shall be diversified in order to avoid incurring
potential losses regarding individual securities which may not be held to
maturity, whether by erosion of market value or change in market conditions
that will not exceed the income generated by the portfolio.
e.   Investments shall be made with the exercise of that degree of judgment and
care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence,
discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs,
not for speculation but for investment, considering the probable safety of
their capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
f.   Bank account relationships will be managed in order to secure adequate
services while minimizing costs. Deposits would be concentrated in single
accounts except where audit control considerations dictate otherwise.
   II.   Maturity. At the time of making an investment the Treasurer should
reasonably expect that the investment can be held until maturity. To the extent
possible, the Treasurer will attempt to match its investments with anticipated
cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a specific cash flow requirement, the
Treasurer will not directly invest in securities maturing more than five years
from the settlement date of purchase.
   III.    Authorized Financial Institutions and Dealers. U.S. Treasury and
Agency securities purchased outright shall be purchased only through financial
institutions located within the State of Ohio or through "primary securities
dealers" as designated by the Federal Reserve Board.
   Repurchase Agreements shall be transacted only through banks located within
the State of Ohio with which the Treasurer has signed a Master Repurchase
Agreement as required in Ohio R.C. Chapter 135.
   Certificates of Deposit shall be transacted through commercial banks or
savings and loans with FDIC of FSLIC coverage which are located within the
State of Ohio and qualify as eligible financial institutions under Ohio R.C.
Chapter 135.
   A list of authorized institutions and dealers shall be maintained with the
investing authority. Additions and deletions to this list shall be made when
deemed in the best interest of the investing authority.
   IV.    Derivatives. Investments in derivatives and in stripped principal or
interest obligations of eligible obligations are strictly prohibited. A
derivative means a financial instrument or contract or obligation whose value
or return is based upon or linked to another asset or index. or both separate
from the financial instrument, contract, or obligation itself. Additionally,
any security, obligation, trust account or instrument that is created from an
obligation of a federal agency or instrumentality or is created from both is
considered a derivative instrument.
   V.    Allowable Investments. The Treasurer may invest in any instrument or
security authorized in Ohio R.C. Chapter 135 as amended. A copy of the
appropriate Ohio R.C. section will be kept with this policy.
   VI.    Collateral. All investments and deposits shall be collateralized
pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 135.
   VII.    Reporting. The investing authority shall establish and maintain an
inventory of all obligations and securities acquired by the investing
authority. The inventory shall include the description of the security, type,
cost, par value, maturity date, settlement date and coupon rate. The investing
authority shall produce a monthly portfolio report detailing the current
inventory of all obligations and securities, and all transactions during the
month, income received and investment expenses paid, and the names of any
persons effecting transactions on behalf of the investment authority.
   VIII.    Committee Meetings. The Investment Advisory Committee will meet at
least once every quarter to review the portfolio in terms of security, type,
risk and investment return. The Treasurer shall be responsible for maintaining
records of all investments and deposits and preparing reports that summarize
recent market conditions, economic conditions, economic developments and
anticipated investments for the investment advisory committee meeting.
   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 135, all brokers, dealers, and financial
institutions initiating transactions with the investment by giving advice or
making investment policy, or executing transactions initiated by the investment
authority, must acknowledge their agreement to abide by the investment policy's
content.
   The Institution below by signing submits that it has read and acknowledges

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
            Chap.
161.    Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 161
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)    Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
   (b)    Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant as
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (l) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

   161.01 ELECTRONICALLY MONITORED HOUSE ARREST.
   (a)    Any or all of the terms of imprisonment authorized under the
ordinances of the City may be served by means of electronically monitored house
arrest, in the sole discretion of the Mayor. In such case, the Mayor shall
determine the number of days of actual imprisonment, the number of days of
electronically monitored house arrest, and whether any of the days of actual
imprisonment shall be suspended on the condition of successful completion of
the incarceration by electronically monitored house arrest. The sum of the days
of actual imprisonment plus the days of electronically monitored house arrest
shall not exceed the stated maximum number of days of imprisonment for that
particular offense.
   (b)    No individual may serve a term of imprisonment by electronically
monitored house arrest unless he or she first executes an appropriate agreement
made available to all such defendants, whereby the defendant agrees to pay the
cost of the system (or, in the sole discretion of the Mayor, such portion of
the cost as he or she can afford to pay) and agrees to abide by all of the
rules and regulations of the electronically monitored house arrest procedure.
The agreement shall provide that no credit for suspended days of actual
incarceration shall be granted unless the defendant successfully completes all
of the days of the electronically monitored house arrest. (Ord. 90-75. Passed
10-30-90.)
   (c)    No person, knowing that he or she is under the restrictions of
electronically monitored house arrest, shall purposely break or attempt to
break such detention, or purposely violate any of the requirements of the
detention. Whoever violates this section is guilty of Contempt of Court, and
shall be punished under the authority of the Mayor's Court of the City of
Sharonville to enforce its orders and punish for contempts. (Ord. 91-7. Passed

information respecting net business profits is furnished.
         A.   Net Profits.
            1.   “Net profit” for a taxpayer other than an individual means
adjusted federal taxable income and “net profit” for a taxpayer who is an
individual means the individual’s profit, other than amounts described in
Section
171.03(e), required to be reported on schedule C, schedule E, or schedule F.
            2.   “Adjusted federal taxable income” means a C corporation’s
federal taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as
determined under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as defined in Section
171.02 herein.
         B.   Gross Receipts.
            1.   Gross receipts shall include but not be limited to income in
the form of commissions, fees, directors’ fees, subpay, profit sharing from
nonqualified plans, rentals from real and tangible personal property, and other
compensation for work or services performed or rendered as well as income from
sales of stock in trade.
            2.   Gross receipts shall include ordinary income from Form 4797.
         C.   Expenses.
            1.   All ordinary and necessary expenses of doing business,
including reasonable compensation paid employees, shall be allowed but no
deduction may be claimed for salary or withdrawal of a proprietor or of the
partners, members, or other owners of an unincorporated business or enterprise.
            2.   If not claimed as part of the cost of goods sold or elsewhere
in the return filed, there may be claimed and allowed a reasonable deduction
for depreciation, depletion, obsolescence, losses resulting from theft or
casualty, not compensated for by insurance or otherwise of property used in the
trade or business, but the amount may not exceed that recognized for the
purpose of the federal income tax. Provided, however, that loss on the sale,
exchange or other disposition of depreciable property or real estate, used in
the taxpayer's business, shall not be allowed as a deductible expense.
            3.   Current amortization of emergency facilities under the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, if recognized as such for federal
income tax purposes, may be included as an expense deduction hereunder.
            4.   Where depreciable property is voluntarily destroyed, only the
cost of such demolition and the undepreciated balance thereof will be allowed
as an expense in the year of such demolition, to the extent allowable for
federal income tax purposes.
            5.   Bad debts in a reasonable amount may be allowed in the year
ascertained worthless and charged off, or at the discretion of the Tax
Administrator (if the reserve method is used), a reasonable addition to the
reserve may be claimed, but in no event shall the amount exceed the amount
allowable for federal income tax purposes.
            6.   Only taxes directly connected with the business may be claimed
as a deduction. If for any reason the income from property is not subject to
the tax, then taxes on and other expenses of said property are not deductible.
In any event, the following taxes are not deductible from income: (1) the tax
under this chapter; (2) federal or other taxes based upon income; (3) gift,
estate or inheritance taxes; (4) taxes for local benefit or improvements to
property which tend to appreciate the value thereof; and (5) self-employment
taxes for unincorporated businesses or other entities, including credit for
employment taxes as allowed for federal tax purposes.
            7.   If the taxpayer reports income that is non-taxable under this
chapter and such amounts are deducted in order to reconcile the municipal
return with the taxpayer’s federal return, expenses attributable to this non-
taxable income shall not be allowed as a deduction from the remaining taxable
income. The expenses attributable to such non-taxable income shall be:
               a.   Five percent (5%) of the non-taxable income. Non- taxable
income given capital gain treatment on the federal return, from which
attributable expenses were already deducted, is not subject to the foregoing.
            8.   An employee who is paid on a commission or other compensation
basis and who pays his business expense from his commissions or other
compensation, without reimbursement from his employer, may deduct from his
gross commissions or other compensations, business expenses allowed by the
Internal Revenue Service for federal income tax purposes but only to the extent
said expenses are incurred in earning commissions or other compensations
subject to the tax imposed by this chapter. Business expenses allowed shall be
those expenses allowed to be claimed on the federal Form 2106 and upon the
request of the Tax Administrator, verifiable with supporting schedules and/or
receipts. Failure to produce the supporting schedules and/or receipts upon
request of the Tax Administrator shall result in disallowance of the expenses
in question. No expenses claimed on federal Form Schedule A, Itemized
Deductions shall be allowed.
            9.   Income from the sale of, or lease of mineral rights are not
taxable and expenses or loss in connection therewith are not deductible for tax
purposes except in cases where taxpayer conducts the activities by which the
minerals are extracted from the land.
            10.   Funds allocated by employers to qualified plans of employees
are not taxable to the employees if the employees have no vested right in the
money so allocated.
            11.   401(k), IRA, SEP, KEOGH plans or any other type of deferred
compensation plans shall not be allowed as a deduction against income for
unincorporated entities or the like as allowed for federal purposes.
            12.   Deductions shall not be allowed for self-employed health
insurance against income as allowed for federal or state tax purposes for
unincorporated entities or the like.
            13.   Expenses incurred while attending educational courses may not
be deducted from wages.
            14.   Moving expenses included in gross earnings shall be an
allowance as a deductible expense. No deduction will be allowed if the taxpayer
does not provide the federal Form 3903 for his moving deductions. Only moving
expenses incurred, as part of income included in gross earnings, will be
allowed.
            15.   In general, all business expense recognized and to the extent
allowed as such for the purpose of determining federal income tax will be
recognized and allowed for determining City income tax under the provisions of
this chapter. However, contributions are not considered as an ordinary and
necessary expense of doing business and are disallowed as an expense.
      (7)   Rentals From Real Property.
         A.   The rental of real estate is ordinarily a business activity, and
the income from such rentals are taxable, provided, however, where the
taxpayer's entire rental activity produces gross rentals of less than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month, it will be prima facie evidence that
such rental activities are not a business activity. If gross rentals equal or
exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month, the entire net income
from rentals is taxable. In determining the amount of gross monthly rental of
any real property, periods during which, by reason of vacancy or any other
cause, rentals are not received shall not be taken into consideration by the
taxpayer.
         B.   Rentals received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of buying
and selling real estate shall be considered as part of business income.
         C.   Real property, as the term is used in the Rules and Regulations
of this chapter, shall include commercial property, residential property, farm
property, and any and all types of real estate.
         D.   In determining the taxable income from rentals, the deductible
expenses shall be of the same nature, extent and amount as are allowed by the
Internal Revenue Service for federal income tax purposes.
         E.   Residents of the City are subject to taxation upon the net income
from rentals (to the extent above specified), regardless of the location of the
real property owned. However, if any such property is located outside the City,
and is subject to another municipal income tax, credit shall be claimed in
accordance with Section
171.14.
         F.   Nonresidents of the City are subject to such taxation only if the
real property is situated within the City.
         G.   To be considered non-taxable as ground rents, the property must
be under perpetual leasehold by the terms of which the lessor performs no
services of any type, including the payment of taxes on the property.
         H.   Businesses owning or managing real estate are taxed only on that
portion of income derived from property located in the City.
      (8)   Royalties. Income in the form of royalties is taxable if taxpayer's
activities produced the publication or other product, the sale of which
produces the royalties.
      (9)   Gambling Winnings. On all income received as gambling winnings as
reported on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2G, Form 5754 and/or any other form
required by the Internal Revenue Service that reports winnings from gambling.
Gambling includes but is not limited to bingo, keno, slot machines, casino
games, horse racing, dog racing, jai alai, sweepstakes, wagering pools,
lotteries, prizes and any other wagering transactions.
      (10)   Non-employee compensation.
      (11)   Fellowships, scholarships, stipends and grants, to the extent that
they are taxable for federal income tax purposes.
   (b)   Apportionment of Business Profits for Businesses Both In and Outside
the City Boundaries. This section does not apply to taxpayers that are subject
to and required to file reports under Chapter 5745, of the Ohio Revised Code.
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, net profit from
a business or profession conducted both within and without the boundaries of a
municipal corporation shall be considered as having a taxable situs in such
municipal corporation for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   Business Apportionment Percentage Formula. Multiply the entire net
profits of the business by a business apportionment percentage formula to be
determined by:
         A.   STEP 1. Ascertain the percentage which the average original cost
of the real and tangible personal property, including leasehold improvements,
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession and situated within
the City during the taxable period is to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            1.   As used in the preceding subsection, real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight
(8).  The percentage of taxpayer's real and tangible personal property within
the City is determined by dividing the average original cost of such property
within the City (without deduction of any encumbrances) by the average original
cost of all such property within and without the City.
            2.   Gross rents means the actual sum of money or other
consideration payable, directly or indirectly, by the taxpayer for the use or
possession of property and includes:
               a.   Any amount payable for the use or possession of real and
tangible personal property or any part thereof, whether designated as a fixed
sum of money or as a percentage of sales profits or otherwise;
               b.   Any amount payable as additional rent or in lieu of rent
such as interest, taxes, insurance, repairs, or other amounts required to be
paid by the terms of a lease or other arrangement.
            3.   A residence may not be considered an office unless a portion
thereof is used exclusively for business purposes and is reached by a separate
entrance in an exterior wall which does not serve as the entrance to the
balance of the building.
         B.   STEP 2. Ascertain the percentage which the total wages, salaries,
including sick and vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments,
settlements, stock options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an
employee buyout or wage continuation plan and other forms of compensation paid
during the taxable period to persons employed in the business or profession for
services performed in the City is to the total wages, salaries, including sick
and vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock
6options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout
or wage continuation plan and other forms of compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed, excluding compensation that is not taxable by the
municipal corporation under Section 718.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
            1.   Salaries, wages, including sick and vacation pay, bonuses,
commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance pay,
severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation plan
and other forms of compensation subject to the City income tax paid owners or
credited to the account of owners or partners during the period covered by the
return are considered wages for the purpose of this computation.
            2.   Salaries, wages, including sick and vacation pay, bonuses,
commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance pay,
severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation plan
and other forms of compensation subject to the City income tax shall be
computed on the cash or accrual basis in accordance with the method of
accounting used in the computation of the entire net income of the taxpayer.
            3.   In the case of an employee who performs services both within
and without the City the amount treated as compensation for services performed
within the City shall be deemed to be:
               a.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends
directly on the volume of business secured by him, such as a salesman on a
commission basis, the amount received by him for the business attributable to
his efforts within the City.
               b.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends on
other results achieved, the proportion of the total compensation received which
the value of his services, within the City bears to the value of all his
services; and
               c.   In the case of an employee compensated on a time basis, the
proportion of the total amount received by him which his working time within
the City is of his total working time.
               d.   Provided, however, all employees regularly connected with
or working out of a place of business maintained by the taxpayer in the City
who perform 75% or more of their services within the City be considered
employees within the City.
            4.   Nonresident professional persons shall use the factor of days
spent within the City to total working days. All employees regularly connected
with or working out of a place of business maintained by the taxpayer outside
the City who perform 25% or less of their services within the City shall be
considered employees outside the City. (The provisions of this subsection are
not applicable in determining the tax liability of a nonresident who works in
and outside the City.)
         C.   STEP 3. Ascertain the percentage which the gross receipts of the
business or profession from sales made and services performed during the
taxable period in the City is to gross receipts of the business or profession
during the same period from sales and services, wherever made or performed.
            1.   The following sales shall be considered City sales:
               a.   All sales made through retail stores located within the
City to purchasers within or without the City except such of said sales to
purchasers outside the City that are directly attributable to regular
solicitations made outside the City personally by taxpayer's employees.
               b.   All sales of tangible personal property delivered to
purchasers within the City regardless of where title passes if shipped or
delivered from a stock of goods at an office, store, warehouse, factory, or
place of storage located within the City.
               c.   All sales of tangible personal property delivered to
purchasers within the City regardless of where title passes even though
transported from a point outside the City if the Taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
City and the sales directly or indirectly result from such solicitation or
promotion.
               d.   All sales of tangible personal property shipped from an
office, store, warehouse, factory or place of storage within the City to
purchasers outside the City if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees
regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place of
delivery.
               e.   Charges for work done or services performed incident to a
sale, whether or not included in the price of the property shall be considered
gross receipts from such sale.
               f.   In the application of the foregoing subsections a carrier
shall be considered the agent of the seller, regardless of the FOB point or
other conditions of the sale, and the place at which orders are accepted or
contracts legally consummated shall be immaterial. Solicitation of customers
outside the City by mail or phone from an office, or place of business within
the City shall not be considered a solicitation of sales outside the City.
               g.   Nonresident professional persons shall use the factor of
the City billings over total billings.
         D.   STEP 4. Adding together the percentages determined in accordance
with Section
171.03 (a), (b) and (c), herein or such of the aforesaid percentages as are
applicable to the particular taxpayer, and dividing the total so obtained by
the number of percentages used in deriving such total. The result so obtained
is the business apportionment percentage.
            1.   A factor is applicable even though it may be apportioned
entirely in or outside the City. A factor is excluded only when it does not
exist anywhere.
            2.   Provided, however, that in the event a just and equitable
result cannot be obtained under the business apportionment percentage formula
provided for herein, the Tax Administrator, upon application of the taxpayer,
shall have the authority to substitute other factors or methods calculated to
effect a fair and proper apportionment.
         E.   STEP 5. The business apportionment percentage determined in Step
4 above shall be applied to the entire taxable net profits of the taxpayer
wherever derived to determine the net profits apportioned to the City.
      (2)   Substitute Method.
         A.   In the event a just and equitable result cannot be obtained under
the business apportionment percentage formula, the Tax Administrator, upon
application of the taxpayer, shall have the authority to substitute other
factors in the business apportionment percentage formula or prescribe other
methods of apportioning net income calculated to effect a fair and proper
apportionment.
         B.   Application to the Tax Administrator to substitute other factors
in the business apportionment percentage formula or to use a different method
to apportion net profits must be made in writing before the end of the tax year
and shall state the specific grounds on which the substitution of factors or
use of a different method is requested and the relief sought to be obtained. A
copy thereof shall be served at the time of filing upon the taxpayer or Tax
Administrator as the case may be. No specific form need be followed in making
such application. Once a taxpayer has filed under a substitute method, he must
continue to so file until given permission to change by the Tax Administrator.
         C.   The decision of the Tax Administrator on subsections (2)A. and
(2)B., hereof may be appealed by the taxpayer to the Board of Review, which
shall have the power to affirm, reverse or modify such decision of the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)   Professional And Personal Service. In the case of professional
people and others furnishing personal services, if their only place of business
is within the City all their net profits shall prima facie be attributable to
the City.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) hereof, net profit from
rental activity not constituting a business or profession shall be subject to
tax only by the municipal corporation in which the property generating the net
profit is located.
   (d)   This section does not apply to individuals who are residents of the
Municipality and, except as otherwise provided in Section 718.01 of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Municipality may impose a tax on all income earned by
residents of the Municipality to the extent allowed by the United States
Constitution.   
   (e)   Net Operating Loss (NOL).
      (1)   A.   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable
year, apportioned to the City, may be applied against the portion of the profit
of succeeding taxable years apportioned to the City, until exhausted, but in no
event for more than the three (3) taxable years immediately following the year
in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried
back against net profits of any prior year.
         B.   A short fiscal year (a fiscal year of less than twelve (12)
months) brought about by a change in accounting period, a new taxpayer
selecting a short fiscal year, or a taxpayer operating in the City for less
than his full accounting period, shall be considered as a full taxable fiscal
year for purposes of loss carry-forward.
      (2)   A.   The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be
apportioned to the City in the same manner as provided herein for apportioning
net profits to the City. The portion of a net operating loss to be carried
forward shall be determined in the year the net operating loss is sustained, on
the basis of the apportionment factors applicable to that year.
         B.   The same method of accounting and apportionment must be used in
the year to which an operating loss is carried as was used in the year in which
the operating loss was sustained.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator shall provide by Rules and Regulations the
manner in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
      (4)   With respect to a return combining taxable income from two or more
sources, the following rules shall be applied:
         A.   The net operating loss sustained by a business or profession is
not deductible from employee earnings, but may be carried forward as provided
in subsection (e)(1) hereof.
         B.   If a taxpayer is engaged in two or more taxable business
activities to be included in the same return, the net loss of one
unincorporated business activity (except any portion of a loss reportable for
municipal income tax purposes to another taxing municipality) may be used to
offset the profits of another for purposes of arriving at overall net profits.
      (5)   The loss from an unincorporated business subject to income tax from
a taxing municipality or J.E.D.D. shall be applied as follows:
         A.   The loss must first be applied to the taxing municipality in
full. To the extent that the tax rate for the City exceeds the tax rate of such
taxing municipality, a portion will be currently deductible against other
unincorporated entities in the current year or be available to be carried
forward.
         B.   The portion of loss allowable is calculated by taking the
difference in tax rates expressed as a percentage and multiplying it by the
current year loss. For example, if a business is located in a taxing
municipality with a tax rate of 1% with a loss of $10,000 the loss allowable
against City business income is $3,300 (ie. 1.5% - 1% = .5%. .005 divided by
.015 = .333. $10,000 x .333 = $3,330). The remaining loss is only allowable
against the other taxing municipality.
      (6)   In any return in which a net operating loss deduction is claimed, a
schedule should be attached showing:
         A.   Year in which net operating loss was sustained.
         B.   Method of accounting and apportionment, used to determine portion
of net operating loss apportioned to the City.
         C.   Amount of net operating loss used as a deduction in prior years.
         D.   Amount of net operating loss claimed as a deduction in current
year.
      (7)   The net operating loss of a taxpayer, which loses its identity
through merger, consolidation, etc., shall not be allowed as a carry-forward
loss deduction to the surviving or new taxpayer.
   (f)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   A consolidated return may be filed by a group of corporations who
are affiliated through stock ownership if that affiliated group filed for the
same tax period a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes pursuant
to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code. A consolidated return must
include all companies that are so affiliated.
      (2)   Once a consolidated return has been filed for any taxable year,
consolidated returns shall continue to be filed in subsequent years unless:
         A.   Permission in writing is granted by the Tax Administrator to file
separate returns.
         B.   A new corporation other than a corporation created or organized
by a member of the group has become a member of the group during the taxable
year.
         C.   A corporation member of the group is sold or exchanged.
Liquidating a corporation or merging one of the corporations of the group into
another will not qualify the group for filing separate returns.
   (g)   Exceptions. The following shall not be considered taxable:
      (1)   Military pay or allowances of members of the armed forces of the
United States and of members of their reserve components, including the Ohio
National Guard.
      (2)   Income of any religious, fraternal, charitable, scientific,
literary, or educational institutions enumerated in Section 718.01 of the Ohio
Revised Code to the extent that such income is derived from tax exempt real
estate, tax exempt tangible or intangible property or tax exempt activities.
         A.   Any association or organization falling in the category listed in
the preceding paragraph is required to file declarations and final returns and
remit the taxes levied under this chapter on all net profits from activities,
the income from which is not specifically exempt from taxation in Section
718.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
         B.   Where such non-profit association or organization conducts
income- producing business both within and without the corporate limits, it
shall calculate its profits apportioned to the City under the method or methods
provided above.
      (3)   Income from intangibles by way of dividends, interest and the like,
if such income is subject to taxation under the intangible personal property
laws of the State of Ohio, are specifically exempt from municipal taxation
under said law.
      (4)   Compensation paid under Section 3501.28 or 3501.36 of the Ohio
Revised Code to a person serving as a precinct official, to the extent that
such compensation does not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) annually. Such
compensation in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000) may be subject to
taxation. The payer of such compensation is not required to withhold City tax
from that compensation.

transit authority, or regional transit commission created under Chapter 306 of
the Ohio Revised Code for operating a transit bus or other motor vehicle for

is operated on a regularly scheduled route, the operator is subject to such a
tax by reason of residence or domicile in the City, or the headquarters of the
authority or commission is located within the City.
      (6)   The income of a public utility when that public utility is subject
to the tax levied under Section 5727.24 or 5727.30 of the Ohio Revised Code,

of the Ohio Revised Code:

Internal Revenue code, to the extent such distributive share would not be
allocated or apportioned to this state under division (B)(1) and (2) of Section
5733.05 of the Ohio Revised Code if the S corporation were a corporation
subject to the taxes imposed under Chapter 5733 of the Ohio Revised Code.

stock options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee
buyout or wage continuation plan, other compensation, and other taxable income
of an employee, and paid by him or them to the Tax Administrator may be
accepted as the return required of any employee whose sole income, subject to
tax under this chapter, is such qualifying wages, including sick and vacation
pay, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance
pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation
plan or other compensation.
      (4)   The return shall be accompanied by payment of any taxes due
thereon.
      (5)   An employee who is paid on a qualifying wage, commission or other
compensation basis and who pays his business expense from his qualifying wage,
commission or other compensation, without reimbursement from his employer, may
deduct from his qualifying wage, commission or other compensation, business
expenses allowed by the Internal Revenue Service for federal income tax
purposes but only to the extent said expenses are incurred in earning
commissions or other compensations subject to the tax imposed by this chapter.
The employee must file a return in order to claim such deductions even though
all or parts of such qualifying wage, commission or other compensation are
subject to withholding. Business expenses allowed shall be those expenses
allowed to be claimed on the federal Form 2106 and upon the request of the Tax
Administrator, verifiable with supporting schedules and/or receipts. Failure to
produce the supporting schedules and/or receipts upon request of the Tax
Administrator shall result in disallowance of the expenses in question. No
expenses claimed on federal Form Schedule A, Itemized Deductions shall be
allowed.
      (6)   Moving expenses included in gross earnings shall be an allowance as
a deductible expense. No deduction will be allowed if the taxpayer does not
provide the federal Form 3903 for his moving deductions. Only moving expenses
incurred, as part of income included in gross earnings, will be allowed.
      (7)   Except as provided for herein, the tax is on the association,
unincorporated business, pass-through entity, profession or other
unincorporated entity as an entity whether resident or nonresident and a return
is required disclosing the net profits apportioned to the City and the tax paid
thereon. However, any resident partner or resident member is required to make a
return and pay the tax in accordance with this chapter and Rules and
Regulations.
      (8)   Any taxpayer who received taxable income not subject to withholding
under this chapter must file a return.
      (9)   Any taxpayer having income, wages, or other compensation for which
a return must be filed, and also having net profits from a business is required
to file only one return.
      (10)   Executors, administrators and trustees are required to file
returns on the trusts, are liable for the payment of any taxes due by a
deceased from an estate of such deceased and are required to give the name and
address of the beneficiaries, even though the latter individually pays the tax.
   (b)   Joint Returns.
      (1)   A husband and wife may file either separate returns or a joint
return for City purposes, even though one of the spouses has neither taxable
income nor deductions included on the City return regardless of whether their
federal and state returns were filed separately or jointly. If a joint City
return is made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate taxable income and
the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several.
      (2)   A husband and wife may file a joint return either when engaged in
the same or separate businesses, but may not deduct business losses of either
from compensation paid by an employer.
   (c)   Returns, Information Required and Reconciliation with Federal Returns.
The return shall be filed with the Tax Administrator on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from such Administrator, or an
acceptable generic form that contains all of the information required to be
submitted with the City’s prescribed form setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, including sick and
vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock
options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or
wage continuation plan, other compensation earned, received, apportioned or set
aside from each employer, gambling winnings, and the net profits from any
business, profession or other activity, including the rental from use of real
and personal property, distributive shares from pass-through entities and other
income defined by statute as taxable, received for the period covered by the
return and such other pertinent facts and information in detail as the Tax
Administrator may require.
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of
federal or state tax returns and/or schedules or other information as the Tax
Administrator may require, including a statement that the figures used in the
return are the figures used in the return for federal income tax, adjusted to
set forth only such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support
tax returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within
the time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns and the failure to
file such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of
this chapter. Provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have ten (10) days
after notification by the Tax Administrator, or his authorized representative,
to file the items required by this paragraph.
      (5)   The Tax Administrator shall accept a generic form of any return,
report, or document required to be filed if the generic form once completed and
filed contains all of the information required to be submitted with the City’s
prescribed returns, reports or documents, and if the taxpayer or return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with this chapter and Rules
and Regulations governing the filing of returns, reports or documents.
      (6)   Where figures of total income, deductions, and net profits are
included, as shown by a federal return, any items of income that are not
subject to the City tax and unallowable expenses shall be eliminated in
determining net income subject to the City tax. The fact that any taxpayer is
not required to file a federal tax return does not relieve him from filing a
City tax return.
      (7)   If a change in federal income tax liability, made by the Internal
Revenue Service, or by a judicial decision, results in an additional amount of
tax payable to the City, a report of such change shall be filed by the taxpayer
within three (3) months after receipt of the final notice from the Internal
Revenue Service or final court decision.
      (8)   If a change in federal income tax liability results in a reduction
of taxes owed and paid to the City, a claim for refund shall be filed with the
Tax Administrator as prescribed in Section
171.11.
   (d)   Extensions.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of the City’s tax
return. The taxpayer shall make the request by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s
request for a federal filing extension with the Tax Administrator.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to file a federal income tax return may
request an extension for filing the City’s tax return in writing.
      (3)   The request for extension shall be filed not later than the last
day for filing the City’s tax return as prescribed by this chapter and Rules
and Regulations.
      (4)   A valid extension request extends the due date for filing a return
to the last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the
federal income tax return has been extended.
      (5)   The Tax Administrator may deny a taxpayer’s request for extension
if the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request;
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request (if
applicable);
         C.   Owes the City any delinquent income tax or any penalty, interest,
assessment or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax;
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (6)   The granting of an extension for filing a City income tax return
does not extend the due date for paying of the tax; hence, penalty and interest
may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of extension at the rate set out
by Section
171.10. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other
filing and payment requirements of the City Tax Code have been met. Any
extension by the Tax Administrator shall be granted with the understanding that
declaration filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if,
upon further examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and
payment requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be
assessed in full and in the same manner as though no extension had been
granted.
      (7)   Information returns, schedules and statements needed to support tax
returns are to be filed within the time limits set forth for filing the tax
returns.
   (e)   Payment with Returns.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon.
However, where any portion of the tax so due shall have been deducted at the
source, pursuant to the provisions of Section
171.06, where any portion of such tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer,
pursuant to the provisions of Section
171.07, or where an income tax, creditable against the City tax pursuant to
Section
171.14 has been paid to another taxing municipality, credit for the amount so
paid shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance, if
any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.
      (2)   Subject to the limitations contained in Section
171.11(b), a taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his election indicated on the
return, such overpayment, or part thereof, shall be refunded, provided that no
additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall be collected
or refunded.
   (f)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and limitations contained in Sections
171.11 and
171.14. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Tax Administrator or upon an acceptable generic form that contains all of the
information required to be submitted with the City’s prescribed form. A
taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or apportionment of net
profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three (3) months from the final determination of any federal
tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s City tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City tax
based upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and pay any
additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.

   171.06 COLLECTION OF TAX AT THE SOURCE.
   (a)   Duty of Withholding and Payment of Tax Withheld by Employer.
      (1)   It is the duty of each employer within, or doing business within
the City, who employs one or more persons, whether as an employee, officer,
director or otherwise, on a salary, wage, commission or other personal service
compensation basis to deduct, each time any such compensation is paid,
allocated or set aside to an employee the tax at the rate provided in Section
171.03 hereof on the qualifying wages, including sick and vacation pay,
bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance
pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation
plan or other compensation due by such employer to each such employee and
shall, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the month following such
withholding, make a return and pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes
so deducted. However, the Tax Administrator shall have the authority to grant
to employers with three or less resident employees permission for said
employees to file individually. The return shall be on a form or forms
prescribed by or acceptable to the Tax Administrator and shall be subject to
the Rules and Regulations prescribed by the Tax Administrator. Nothing in this
section prohibits an employer from withholding tax on a basis greater than
qualifying wages. The tax shall be deducted by the employer from:
         A.   The gross amount of all salaries, wages, including sick and
vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock
options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or
wage continuation plan or other forms of compensation subject to the City
income tax paid, allocated or set aside to residents of the City, regardless of
the place where services are rendered; and
         B.   The gross amount of all salaries, wages, including sick and
vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock
options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or
wage continuation plan or other forms of compensation subject to the City
income tax paid, allocated or set aside to nonresidents for work done or
service performed or rendered in the City or as a result of employment in the
City or other activities engaged in within the City.
         C.   An employer is liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax in fact has been withheld.
      (2)   All employers within or doing business within the City are required
to make the collections and deductions specified, regardless of the fact that
the services on account of which any particular deduction is required, as to
residents of the City, were performed outside the City.
      (3)   Employers who do not maintain a permanent office or place of
business in the City, but who are subject to tax on net profits attributable to
the City, under the method of allocation provided for in this chapter, are
considered to be employers within the City and subject to the requirements of
withholding.
      (4)   Commissions and fees paid to professionals, brokers and others who
are independent contractors, and not employees of the payer, are not subject to
withholding or collection of the tax at the source. Such taxpayers must in all
instances file a declaration and return and pay the tax pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter and Rules and Regulations.
      (5)    Where a nonresident receives compensation for personal services
rendered or performed partly within and partly without the City, the
withholding employer shall deduct, withhold and remit the tax on that portion
of the compensation which is earned within the City in accordance with the
following rules of apportionment:
         A.   If an employer is located within the City, all non-resident
employees who report to the City location are taxable to the City unless the
employer is withholding tax for other taxing municipalities where the
employee’s work is performed. For purposes of determining the tax liability of
non-resident employees who report to the City location and who perform their
work in non-taxing locations, a flat percentage of twenty percent (20%) will be
used as the percent of time in the City, provided the wages were withheld
correctly.
         B.   If the nonresident is a salesman, agent or other employee whose
compensation depends directly on the volume of business transacted or chiefly
effected by him, the deducting and withholding shall attach to the portion of
the entire compensation which the volume of business transacted or chiefly
effected by the employee within the City bears to the total volume of business
transacted by him within and outside the City.
         C.   The deducting and withholding of personal service compensation of
other nonresident employees, including officers of corporations shall attach to
the proportion of the personal service compensation of such employee which the
total number of his working hours within the City is of the total number of
working hours.
         D.   The fact that nonresident employees are subject to call at any
time does not permit the apportionment of pay for time worked within the City
on a seven-day per week basis. The percentage of time worked in the City will
be computed on the basis of a forty-hour week unless the employer notifies the
Tax Administrator that a greater or lesser number of hours per week is worked.
            1.   The determination of tax liability of nonresidents working in
and out of the corporate limits is to be computed on the formula of the total
number of days worked in the City divided by the total number of days worked
during the year and the resulting percentage applied to the total annual income
from qualifying wages including sick leave, holiday pay, vacation pay and other
wage continuation plans during periods of disability, sickness or absence from
work. Where no record can be substantiated of the number of days worked, the
figure 260 is to be used as the total number of days worked.
         E.   Wages of occasional entrants as defined in Section
171.03(a)(2)C. are not subject to withholding.
         F.   Wage continuation plans paid by the employer or third party agent
on behalf of the employer for the purpose of health, rest, recuperation or
other reward are deemed to have the same tax situs as the primary job
assignment or job location of the employee and are taxable on the same ratio as
the normal earnings of such employee for this primary job assignment.
      (6)   An employer shall withhold the tax on the full amount of any
advances made to an employee on account of commissions.
      (7)   An employer required to withhold the tax on compensation paid to an
employee shall, in determining the amount on which the tax is to be withheld,
ignore any amount allowed and paid to the employee for expenses necessarily and
actually incurred by the employee in the actual performance of his services,
provided such expenses are incurred in earning compensation, including
commissions, and are not deducted as a business expense by the employee.
      (8)   An employer whose records show that an employee is a nonresident of
the City and has no knowledge to the contrary shall be relieved of the
responsibility of withholding the tax on personal service compensation paid to
such employee for services rendered or work done outside the City by such
employee, provided, however, that such employer must withhold the tax on all
personal service compensation paid such employee after the Tax Administrator
notifies said employer in writing that such employee is a resident of the City.
All employees are required to notify the employer of any change of residence
and the date thereof.
      (9)   An employer shall not be required to withhold the City tax from the
qualifying wages earned by a resident of the City for work done or services
performed in another taxing municipality which imposes a tax upon such
qualifying wages of such City resident if such employer withholds the tax on
such resident's wages or other compensation for such other taxing municipality.
Except, where such municipal tax is for a smaller amount than the tax imposed
by this chapter, the employer shall withhold and remit the difference to the
City.
      (10)   The Tax Administrator shall have authority to enter into agreement
with other taxing municipalities permitting an employer to withhold the entire
tax on the qualifying wages, including sick and vacation pay, bonuses,
commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance pay,
severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation plan
or other forms of compensation subject to the City income tax of a floater
either for the taxing municipality in which the employer has his principal
place of business or the taxing municipality in which the employee resides.
   (b)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual’s disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (c)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (d)   Compensation deferred before the effective date of this amendment is
not subject to any municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax
withholding requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not
constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or
distributed.
   (e)   So long as the taxes withheld by an employer for the City during the
measurement period are less than three hundred dollars ($300.00) per month,
payments may be made quarterly on or before the last day of the month following
the end of the quarter, subject to the approval of the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator may grant an exemption to an employer from the duty to make
payment of withheld taxes by electronic funds transfer upon application for
such exemption by the employer and the employer’s demonstration to the Tax
Administrator that the requirement to make payment of withheld taxes by
electronic funds transfer will impose a hardship upon the employer. The Tax
Administrator may revoke either approval granted in this section whenever the
Tax Administrator has reason to believe that the conditions for granting such
authorization have changed, were judged incorrectly, were not met, or when it
is in the best interest of the City to do so. Notice of withdrawal shall be
made in writing and, in such case, the employer must begin to file in
accordance with this section.
(Ord. 2005-57. Passed 11-29-05; Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
   (f)   Employer Considered as Trustee.
      (1)   Each employer in collecting the tax shall be deemed to hold the
same, until payment is made by such employer to the City, as a trustee for the
benefit of the City, and any such tax collected by such employer from his
employees shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in
the hands of such employer.
      (2)   Each employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required
to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax in fact has been withheld.
   (g)   Personal Liability for Collection and Payment of Tax. Any person who
is required to withhold tax from qualifying wages, including sick and vacation
pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options,
grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage
continuation plan or other compensation, shall pay all such tax to the City in
accordance with the provisions of this section. In the event taxes withheld
from the qualifying wages of employees are not paid to the City in accordance
with the provisions of this section, all officers, members, managers,
employees, and trustees having control or supervision of or charged with the
responsibility of filing the return and making payment are jointly and
severally personally liable for the tax not returned or paid to the City as
well as any related interest and penalties, and are also criminally liable
under the provisions of Section
171.12. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation, limited
liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer’s, member’s,
manager’s, employee’s, or trustee’s liability for a failure of the corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or pay said taxes.
   (h)   Withholding Return; List of Employees.
      (1)   Each employer shall file a withholding tax reconciliation form
showing the sum total of all compensation paid all employees, the portion of
which, if any, was not subject to withholding along with an explanation for
same, and the portion of which was subject to withholding, together with the
amount of such withholdings remitted. Such return shall include Form W-2 for
each employee or a list of employees containing W-2 information concerning each
employee from whom the City tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip
code and social security number of each such employee, the total amount of
compensation paid during the year and the amount of City tax withheld. If the
total tax withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to
another taxing municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on
the return of information to the City concerning each employee. The withholding
tax reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before February 28
following the end of such calendar year.
      (2)   If more than the amount of tax required to be deducted by this
chapter is withheld from the employee's pay, the excess shall be refunded by
the employer to the employee. If less than the amount of tax required to be
deducted is deducted and withheld by the employer in any pay period or pay
periods, the deficiency shall be deducted in subsequent pay periods.
      (3)   When an employer has withheld the tax from all wages of a
nonresident of the City and such nonresident has been employed outside the City
for all or a part of the time and has been withheld for or has paid taxes due
another municipality as a result of that employment, such employee shall file a
claim with the Tax Administrator covering such erroneous withholding and the
Tax Administrator shall, upon verification thereof by the employer, refund to
the employee the amount of such withholding paid to another municipality,
subject to the requirements and limitations contained in Sections
171.11 and
171.14.
   (i)   Form 1099 Reporting. In addition to the wage reporting of this
section, any person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form
1099-Misc. payments to individuals not treated as employees for services
performed shall also report such payment to the City when the services were
performed in the City. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall
include the name, address and social security number (or federal identification
number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal Form(s) 1099 may be
submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on
or before February 28.
   (j)   Domestic Servants. However, no person shall be required to withhold
the tax on the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation and other
taxable income paid to domestic servants employed exclusively in or about such
person’s residence. However, such domestic servants shall be responsible for
filing and paying their own returns and taxes.
   (k)   Fractional Parts Of Cents. In deducting and withholding tax at the
source and in payment of any tax due under the Ordinance, a fractional part of
a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent (.005) or more
in which case it shall be increased to one cent (.01).
(Ord. 2003-96E. Passed 12-23-03; Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
   171.07 DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   Requirement for Filing.
      (1)   Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not or
will not be withheld by an employer or employers subject to Section
171.06, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
subject to the tax imposed by Section
171.03, shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the
estimated profit or loss from such business activity together with the
estimated tax due thereon, if any. Provided, however, if a person’s income is
wholly from qualifying wages from which the tax will be withheld and remitted
to this City in accordance with Sections
171.03,
171.06 and
171.14, such person need not file a declaration.
      (2)   A taxpayer’s final return for the preceding year may be used as the
basis for computing his declaration of estimated tax for the current year. In
the event a taxpayer has not previously been required to file a return, a
declaration of estimated tax on anticipated income shall be filed in good
faith.
   (b)   Dates for Filing.
      (1)    Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15th of each
year during the effective period of this chapter, or on or before the fifteenth
(15th) day of the fourth (4th) month following the date the taxpayer first
becomes subject to the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month
following the start of each fiscal year or period.
   (c)   Forms: Credit for Tax Withheld or Paid Another Taxing Municipality.
      (1)   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by or
obtainable from the Tax Administrator, or upon an acceptable generic form that
contains all of the information required to be submitted with the City’s
prescribed form. Credit shall be taken in such declaration for City tax to be
withheld from any portion of such income and for income taxes to be paid to
another taxing municipality for which credit is allowed against City tax under
Section
171.14.
      (2)   For taxpayers who are individuals, such declaration of estimated
tax to be paid the Municipality shall be accompanied by a payment of at least
twenty- two and one-half percent (22.5%) of the estimated tax liability for the
current year and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the last
day of the seventh (7th), tenth (10th) and thirteenth (13th) months after the
beginning of the taxable year.
      (3)   For taxpayers that are not individuals, such declaration of
estimated tax to be paid the Municipality shall be accompanied by a payment of
at least twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of the estimated tax liability
for the current year and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before
the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth (6th), ninth (9th) and twelfth (12th)
months after the beginning of the taxable year.
      (4)   The mere submission of a declaration estimating a tax liability
shall not constitute filing unless accompanied by the required payment.
   (d)   Amended Declaration.
      (1)   A declaration may be amended at any time, provided, however, that
in case an amended declaration is filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon
shall be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
      (2)   An amended declaration must be filed on or before the last day of
the month following the close of the taxpayer’s tax year, if it appears that
the original declaration made for such year underestimated the taxpayer’s
income by ten percent (10%) or more. At such time a payment, which together
with prior payments, is sufficient to pay the taxpayer’s entire estimated
liability, shall be made. If, upon the filing of the return required it appears
that the taxpayer did not pay ninety percent (90%) of his tax liability, as
shown on such return, on or before the last day of the month following the
close of the tax year, the difference between ninety percent (90%) of such
taxpayer’s tax liability and the amount of estimated tax he actually paid on or
before such date shall be subject to the interest and penalty provisions of
Section
171.10.
      (3)   In the event an amended declaration has been filed the unpaid
balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments over the
remaining payment dates.
   (e)   Annual Return Required. On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
fourth (4th) month following the end of the calendar or fiscal year an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the City shall be paid
therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section
171.05.
(Ord. 2003-96E. Passed 12-23-03.)
   171.08 DUTIES OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   (1)   It shall be the duty of the Tax Administrator to collect and
receive the tax imposed by this chapter in the manner prescribed herein, to
keep an accurate record thereof and to report all monies so received.
      (2)   It shall be the duty of the Tax Administrator to enforce payment of

   171.10 INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   All taxes imposed and monies withheld or required to be withheld by
employers under the provisions of this chapter and remaining unpaid after they
become due shall bear interest at the same rate which Section 718.12 of the
Ohio Revised Code requires be paid by municipalities on their income tax
refunds, i.e., the federal short-term rate as defined in Section 5703.47 of the
Ohio Revised Code, as amended, plus three percent (3%) per year.
 
   (b)   In addition to interest as provided in subsection (a) hereof,
penalties for failure to pay taxes and to withhold and remit taxes pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter are hereby imposed as follows:
      (1)   In the case of taxpayers and/or residents failing to file a tax
return by the due date or by the date resulting from an extension, and/or

higher of twenty- five dollars ($25.00) or one percent (1%) per month or
fraction thereof.
      (2)   In the case of employers, required by Section
171.06 to withhold the City tax, who fail to withhold and remit such taxes to
be withheld from employees to the Tax Commissioner: the higher of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) or three percent (3%) per month or fraction thereof.
      (3)   Where the taxpayer has failed to file a declaration on which he has
estimated and paid a tax equal to or greater than the tax paid for the previous
year, or where he has filed a previous return and has failed to file a
declaration on which he has estimated and paid a tax equal to or greater than

percent (90%) of the actual tax for the year and the amount paid through
withholding and declaration.
      (4)   No penalty or interest shall be charged against a taxpayer for the

(50%) percent of the unpaid tax.
   (c)   Exceptions.

made by the Tax Administrator when a return has been filed in good faith and
the tax paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)   In the absence of fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be
assessed on any additional tax assessment resulting from a federal audit,
providing an amended return is filed and the additional tax is paid within

         (Ord. 2003-96E. Passed 12-23-03; Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
   171.11 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   Unpaid Sums – A Civil Debt.
      (1)   All taxes imposed by this chapter and not paid when due shall be
collectible, together with any interest and penalties thereon, by suit as other
debts of like amount are recoverable. Employers who are required, under Section
171.06, to withhold or remit the taxes required to be withheld at the source
and who fail to withhold or remit, become liable to the City in a civil action
to enforce the payment of the debt created by such failure.
      (2)   No additional assessment shall be made by the Tax Administrator
after three (3) years from the time the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later. Provided, however, there shall be no period of limitation
on an additional assessment in a case of a return that omits gross income in
excess of twenty-five percent (25%) of that required to be reported or in the
case of filing a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, or in
the case of failure to file a return.
      (3)   In those cases in which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
Service and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the federal statute of
limitations the period within which an additional assessment may be made by the
Tax Administrator shall be extended one (1) year from the time of the final
determination of the federal tax liability.
   (b)   Refunds and Overpayments.
      (1)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for
refund is made within three (3) years from the date on which such payment was
made or the return was due, or within three (3) months after final
determination of the federal tax liability, whichever is later.
      (2)   No refund shall be made to any taxpayer until he has complied with
all provisions of this chapter and has furnished all information required by
the Tax Administrator.
      (3)   Overpayments will be either refunded or credited to the taxpayer's
current liability at his option. Where the taxpayer has made no election,
overpayments of any year's taxes shall be applied as follows:
         A.   To taxes owed for any previous years in the order in which such
taxes become due.
         B.   To current estimated tax liability
   (c)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any City income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment, except that if
any overpayment is refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date
of the annual return or ninety (90) days after the complete return is filed,
whichever is later, no interest shall be allowed on the refunded overpayment.
For purposes of computing the payment of interest on overpayments, no amount of
tax for any taxable year shall be treated as having been paid before the date
on which the tax return for that year was due without regard to any extension
of time for filing that return. The interest shall be paid at the rate of
interest prescribed by Ohio Revised Code 5703.47.
   (d)   Amounts of less than ten dollars ($10.00) shall not be collected,
refunded or credited. (Ord. 2003-96E. Passed 12-23-03; Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-
24-15.)

prosecutions may be commenced within six (6) years after the commission of the
offense.
   (c)   The failure of any employer, taxpayer or person to receive or procure
a return, declaration or other required form shall not excuse him from making
any information return, return or declaration, from filing such form, or from
paying the tax.
   (d)   “Person” as used in this section shall, in addition to the meaning

   (b)   A majority of the members of the Board of Review shall constitute a

this section shall adopt rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record
of its transactions. Such records are not public records available for
inspection under Section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. Hearings requested by
a taxpayer before the Board of Review are not meetings of a public body subject

to be disclosed by this chapter, shall apply to such matters as may be heard

qualifying wages, including sick and vacation pay, bonuses, commissions,
incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance pay, severance pay,
any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation plan or other

income tax has been paid on such income to another taxing municipality or to a
joint economic development zone or district created under Sections 715.69
through 715.83 of the Ohio Revised Code, the taxpayer shall claim a credit of
the amount of tax paid by him or on his behalf to such municipality or joint
economic development zone or district, but the credit is limited to the income
apportioned to the other taxing municipality or joint economic development zone
or district times the City tax rate. No credit is given for county or school
district taxes paid; only other municipal taxes.
   (c)   Except as provided in subsection (d) hereof, if tax or withholding is
paid to a municipal corporation on income or wages, and if a second municipal

tax or withholding the second municipality claims is due with respect to such
income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipal
corporation with respect to such income or wages.

authority of the taxing municipality to which the taxes are paid that a City
resident or his employer is paying the tax shall be considered as fulfilling
the requirement of this section.

   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (A)   "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation

income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:

income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.

under division (A)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or

Revenue Code;
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(4)(b) of this section,

      (1)    "DOMICILE" means the true, fixed and permanent home of the
taxpayer to which whenever absent, the taxpayer intends to return.    
      (2)    An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Municipality for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the
Municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if
the Tax Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (3)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (A)(1) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
   (B)    For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:

residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation or state where the educational institution is located;
      (9)    The number of contact periods the individual has with the
Municipality. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact
period" with the Municipality if the individual is away overnight from the
individual's abode located outside of the Municipality and while away overnight
from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the Municipality. For purposes of this section, the State's
contact period test or bright-line test and resulting determination have no
bearing on municipal residency or domicile.
   (C)   All applicable factors are provided in Ohio Revised Code Section

172.05 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
172.051 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned or deemed to be received
from said employer by the employee in the Municipality multiplied by the
applicable rate of the Municipality's income tax, except for qualifying wages
for which withholding is not required under section
172.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold
the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other
payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or
credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)    In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the
Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes deducted
and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the Tax
Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following schedule:
      (1)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required to
make payments under division (B)(2) of this section of taxes required to be
deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
      (2)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(2) of this section shall be made to
the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of the
month.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required to
make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the
Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under section
172.091 of this Chapter.
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.
   (K)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), and (F) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages

one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
172.051 of this Chapter.
               (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
172.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
172.051 of this Chapter.

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "INCOME" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (a)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
 172.03(W).
         (b)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section

      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B) (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in

Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
 172.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division

172.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid

         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria in (a), (b) or (c) for taxable years beginning on or after
January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017; and only if, regardless of where
title passes, the property meets either of the following criteria (a) or (b)
for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (1)   For purposes of the application of any net operating loss realized
from the rental of real estate, said loss is to be applied using separate
accounting as it relates to those properties within a given municipal taxing
jurisdiction.
      (2)   Common or shared expenses relating to rental real estate shall be
allocated equally among all rental properties.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
172.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from

that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.

   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to

one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a

      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1)
of (2) of this section is binding upon the tax commission for the remainder for

Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
172.03(A) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (A) of
172.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
172.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to municipal income taxation as a
separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of the entity's
net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
172.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group. The entity shall be subject to
taxation as a separate taxpayer on that portion of the entity's net profit or
loss not included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated
group and sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
172.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
172.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

derives from the retained employees of the taxpayer, and shall be for a term
not exceeding fifteen years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance
allowing such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes.
        (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before
the date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under

172.091 of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the

      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax

      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
172.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)    For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)    For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)    An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
172.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of

in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by

         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
172.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors. (Ord.
2015-40. Passed 11-24-15; Ord. 2018-10-E. Passed 2-27-18.)
172.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.

   (A)    Resident Individual.
      (1)   An individual taxpayer who resides in the municipality, and earns
qualifying wages for work done or services performed or rendered in any
municipal corporation, shall be allowed a credit in the amount of municipal
income tax paid on the same income (i.e. on each dollar taxed) by or on behalf
of that individual if it is demonstrated that a municipal income tax has been
so paid. Such credit shall be allowed only to the extent of the tax levied by
this chapter.
      (2)   An individual taxpayer who resides in the municipality, and
receives or wins prizes, awards, sweepstakes, and other income associated with
any lottery winnings, gambling and sports winnings, or other similar games of
chance in any municipal corporation shall be allowed a credit in the amount of
municipal income tax paid on the same income (i.e. on each dollar taxed) by or
on behalf of that individual if it is demonstrated that a municipal income tax
has been so paid. Such credit shall be allowed only to the extent of the tax
levied by this chapter.
       (3)   A resident individual with income from an ownership interest in
one or more pass-through entities, activities of a sole proprietor, or rental
activities, after the deduction of distributable losses from other pass-through
entities or business activities not utilized as a net operating loss carry-
forward in any municipal taxing jurisdiction after January 1, 2018 shall be
allowed a non-refundable credit for the amount so paid on the same income (i.e.
on each dollar taxed) by or on behalf of the resident individual in such other
municipal corporation only to the extent of the tax levied by this chapter.
      (4)   The credit for tax paid by a resident individual for salaries or
wages earned in a non-resident municipal corporation is limited to the tax that
is paid on the same income (i.e. on each dollar taxed) after all allowable 2106
expenses have been deducted and shall not exceed the tax established by this
chapter.
      (5)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other

the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by dividing the
tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for that
municipality.
      (6)   No credit shall be given to a resident individual for any county or
school district income tax.
   (B)   Non-resident individual.
      (1)   Every individual taxpayer who is a non-resident of the municipality
who earned qualifying wages for work done or services performed or rendered in
the municipality, shall be allowed a credit for the amount so paid if it is
demonstrated that a municipal income tax has been paid by or on behalf of that
individual to the municipality. Such credit shall be applied only to the extent
of the tax levied by this chapter.
      (2)   A non-resident individual with ownership interest in one or more
pass-through entities taxed at the entity level shall not report said income or
losses on a non-resident individual annual return and shall not be allowed any
credit for taxes paid on their behalf by the pass-through entity to any
municipal corporation.
      (3)   No credit shall be given to a non-resident individual for any
county or school district income tax. (Ord. 2019-45-E. Passed 6-18-19.)
172.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    “NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"QUALIFYING LOSS" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "QUALIFYING TAX RATE" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
172.083 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
172.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
172.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
172.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
172.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. (Ord.
2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
172.09 ANNUAL RETURN.
172.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)    Unless the provisions of division (A)(2) of this section apply,
an annual return with respect to the income tax levied on Municipal Taxable
Income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by every taxpayer for
any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the tax, regardless of
whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under division
172.051(C) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due to the
Municipality.
      (3)   All resident individual taxpayers, eighteen years of age and older,
shall file an annual municipal income tax return with the Municipality,
regardless of income or liability. The fact that any resident individual
taxpayer is not required to file a federal return does not relieve the resident
individual taxpayer from filing a Municipality return.
      (4)   All resident individual taxpayers under the age of eighteen who
have municipal taxable income shall file an annual municipal income tax return
with the Municipality.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)    A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the

refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including 1099s, schedules, other
municipal income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to
verify credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall
also be included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax
Administrator of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of each individual income tax return required to be
filed by an individual, and each net profit income tax return required to be
filed by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the
amount shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
172.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
172.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
172.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
Section
172.051(B) of this Chapter.
      (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that date to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"THE DATE OF POSTMARK" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
 172.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "WORKSITE LOCATION" has the same
meaning as in Section
172.052 of this Chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
      (3)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
      (4)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person. (Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15; Ord. 2018-10-E. Passed 2-
27-18.)

reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "QUALIFYING TAXPAYER" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes, the payment of which are extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section, are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
172.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
172.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. The
taxpayer shall attach a copy of said federal extension request to the municipal
income tax return.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return. The
taxpayer shall attach a copy of said federal extension request to the municipal
income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return. (Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
172.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return, following the provisions of Section
 172.063 of this Chapter.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
172.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of
this section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or less, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
172.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
         (Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
172.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund or credit, the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall
refund or credit to employers, agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers,
with respect to any income or withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
    (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund or credit requested exceeds
ten dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
172.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Sectio
n 172.10 of this Chapter.

failure to timely file each return, regardless of the liability shown thereon
for each month, or any fraction thereof, during which the return remains
unfiled regardless of the liability shown thereon. The penalty shall not exceed
a total of one hundred fifty dollars in charged penalty for each failure to
timely file a return.
   (D)   With respect to income taxes, estimated income taxes, withholding
taxes, and returns, the Municipality shall not impose, seek to collect, or

collected before January 1, 2016.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may, in the Tax Administrator's sole discretion,
abate or partially abate penalties or interest imposed under this section when
the Tax Administrator deems such abatement or partial abatement to be
appropriate. Such abatement or partial abatement shall be properly documented
and maintained on the record of the taxpayer who received benefit of such
abatement or partial abatement.
   (G)   The Municipality shall impose on the taxpayer, employer, any agent of
the employer, or any other payer the Municipality's post-judgment collection
costs and fees, including attorney's fees. (Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15; Ord.

172.11 AUDIT.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, as defined in Section
172.03(C) of this Chapter, the Tax Administrator shall provide to the taxpayer
a written description of the roles of the Tax Administrator and of the taxpayer
during an audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights, including any right
to obtain a refund of an overpayment of tax. At or before the commencement of
an audit, the Tax Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is
considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer. A
taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting an
audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.

fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.

computations, assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax
Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

made for which an appeal has been filed with the Local Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (1)    In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has
filed a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Tax
Administrator may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the
Municipality from the taxpayer, and upon the basis of such determination may
send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the amount of tax so
determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.
      (2)    Such determination of tax may be adjusted upon submission by the
taxpayer of actual records from which his tax may be computed.
   (H) Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
   (I)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

      (Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
172.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "CLAIM" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim

compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be charged

financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15; Ord. 2018-10-E. Passed 2-27-18.)
172.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
172.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
172.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
172.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
172.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
172.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
 172.15 of this Chapter and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.

   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter

administering this chapter.
      (1)   All employees of the Municipality Income Tax Department shall
maintain complete confidentiality over all data and statistical information
compiled by them in their capacity as employees of the Municipality Income Tax
Department, subject to the exceptions provided for in this section. This
section shall apply only to the Municipality income tax, and not to any other
tax data gathered by such employees in the normal course of their employment.
All confidential information may be subject to Court Order or subpoena, or may
be disclosed upon a proper release executed by the affected taxpayer.
      (2)   The following statistical data may be transmitted to another
Municipality department for internal administrative purposes: information that
may be obtained from a separate source, including names, addresses and
telephone numbers.
      (3)   The following statistical data may be transmitted to another
Municipality department for internal administrative purposes: data regarding
the collective payroll withholding taxes of a business entity located within
the Municipality, as long as such business entity involves more than one
individual for whom the withholding tax payments are being generated.
      (4)   The following statistical data may be transmitted to another
Municipality department for internal administrative purposes: data regarding
the number of employees and the total payroll taxes generated by all employees
of a business entity located within the Municipality as long as the business
entity employs more than one individual at any time. This data shall only
include the total number of employees and the combined total payroll taxes, and
shall not include earnings or payroll taxes of individual employees of such
business entity.
      (5)   No employee of the Municipality Income Tax Department shall
disclose to the general public or to any other Municipality department data
concerning individual earnings or profits earned by an individual or by a
business entity. No statistical or administrative data shall be disseminated or
disclosed to members of the general public.
      (6)   Upon proper release, individual data, including confidential data,
may be released. The Municipality Income Tax Department shall maintain a copy
of the release after such data has been disclosed.
         (Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)

or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,

Administrator.
(Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
172.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
    (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of sectio
n 172.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,

   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
172.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
172.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
         (a)   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment.
         (b)   One member shall be appointed by the Mayor, the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the Mayor.
      (4)    Members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by the
legislative authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth
in section 718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)    Non-employee members of the Local Board of Tax Review shall
receive such compensation as the legislative authority may determine and as may
be restricted by the laws of the State of Ohio.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
172.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "QUALIFYING DEFERRAL PERIOD" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
172.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any

required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought

 172.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
172.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
172.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by
172.096(D) of this Chapter.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
           (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition
of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

   181.01 DEFINITIONS.
   Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this
section govern the construction of this chapter.
   (a)    "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any
other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (b)    "Treasurer" means the City Treasurer of the City of Sharonville, or
the Tax Administrator, agent for the Treasurer.
      (Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77; Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
   (c)    "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered for a consideration to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for
the accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or several
structures. (Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77.)
   (d)    "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations regardless of the duration of their occupancy.
      (Ord. 90-49. Passed 6-10-90.)
   (e)    "Rent" means the consideration received for occupancy valued in
money, whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash,
credits and property or services of any kind or nature, and also any amount for
which the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   (f)    "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether
in the capacity of owner, lessee, mortgagee, in possession, licensee or any
other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing
agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall
also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the
same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of
this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be
considered to be compliance by both.
   (g)    "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms or space or portion thereof, in any hotel for
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or right to use
or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office space, banquet
or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space shall not be
considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless the person
exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to use or possess all
or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes. (Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77.)
   181.02 RATE OF TAX.
   (a)    Commencing on October l, l99l, there is hereby levied an excise tax
of three percent (3%) on all transactions by which lodging by a hotel or motel
is furnished to transient guests. Prior to such time, the rate of tax shall be
one and one-half percent (1-l/2%).
(Ord. 91-50. Passed 6-l l-91.)
   (b)    Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the City
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City,
or to the City. The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the
hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the transient guest ceasing to occupy space in the hotel.
If for any reason, the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the
Treasurer may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax
Administrator. (Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77; Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11- 24-15.)

subdivisions;
   (c)    Upon rents of two dollars ($2.00) a day or less.

penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the Treasurer. All claims of
exemption under subsection (c) hereof shall be made in the manner prescribed by
the Treasurer. (Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77.)
   181.04 TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)    The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for such occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the City, and the operator shall be
liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
   (b)    No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent,
or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter
provided. (Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77.)
   181.05 REGISTRATION.
   Within thirty days after the effective date of this chapter, or within
thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any
hotel renting lodging to transient guests shall register such hotel with the
Tax Administrator and obtain from him a "Transient Occupancy Registration
Certificate" to be posted at all times in a conspicuous place on the premises.

   (b)    The address of the hotel;
   (c)    The date upon which the certificate was issued;

person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Transient
Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administratorfor the

remitting said tax to the treasurer. This certificate does not constitute a
permit."
      (Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77; Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
   181.06 REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the
close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period
which may be established by the Treasurer, make a return to the Treasurer, on
forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount
of tax collected for transient occupancies. All claims for exemption from tax
filed by occupants with the operator during the reporting period shall be filed
with the report. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax
collected shall be remitted to the Treasurer. The Treasurer may establish
shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary
in order to insure collection of the tax and he may require further information
in the return as such information is pertinent to the collection of the tax.
Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any
reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held
in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the
Treasurer. All returns and payments submitted by each operator shall be treated
as confidential by the Treasurer and shall not be released by him except upon
order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the
United States, the State, the County, or the City for official use only. (Ord.
77-2. Passed 2-22-77.)
   181.07 PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (a)    Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this
chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten percent of
the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (b)    Fraud. If the Tax Administrator determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to twenty-
five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the
penalties stated in subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)    Interest. In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the
rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax,
exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became
delinquent until paid.
   (d)    Penalties During Pendency of Hearing or Appeal. No penalty provided
under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed during the pendency of any
hearing provided for in Section
181.08 nor during the pendency of any appeal to the Board of Review provided
for in Section
181.09.
   (e)    Abatement of Interest and Penalty. In cases where a return has been
filed in good faith and an assessment has been paid within the time prescribed
by the Treasurer, the Tax Administrator may abate any charge of penalty or
interest or both.
(Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77; Ord. 2015-48. Passed 11-24-15.)
   181.08 FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION OF TAX BY CITY
TREASURER.
   If any operator fails or refuses to collect such tax and to make, within the
time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Tax Administrator shall proceed
in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to
base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax Administrator procures
such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the
assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who
has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and
remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the
tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such
determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall give a notice of the amount
so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known
place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or
mailing of such notice make application in writing to the Tax Administrator for
a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing
is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if
any, determined by the Tax Administrator shall become final and conclusive and
immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the Tax Administrator
shall give not less than five days written notice in the manner prescribed
herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice
why such amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest
and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why
such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such
hearing, the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted
and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed
herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and
penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days
unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section
 181.09.
(Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77; Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
   181.09 APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by the decision of the Tax Administrator with respect
to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the
Board of Review by filing a notice of appeal with them within fifteen days of
the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Board of Review
shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and shall give notice in
writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of
the Board of Review shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the
appellant in the manner prescribed in Section
181.08 for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be
immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.
(Ord. 77-2. Passed 2-22-77; Ord. 2015-40. Passed 11-24-15.)
   181.10 REFUNDS.
   (a)    Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
subsections (b) and (c) hereof provided a claim in writing therefor stating
under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded,
is filed with the Treasurer within three years of the date of payment. The
claim shall be on forms furnished by the Treasurer.
   (b)    An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Treasurer that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient guest; provided, however, that neither a refund
nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has
either been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently
payable by the transient guest to the operator.
   (c)    A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by
filing of a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) hereof, but only
when the transient guest having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to
the satisfaction of the Treasurer that the transient guest has been unable to
obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.
   (d)    No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless

   (c)    No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the

   313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is

   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
3            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified

device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the

notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the

the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred

section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of

   (a)    A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other

      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
   501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a mentally retarded,
developmentally disabled, or physically impaired child under twenty-one years
of age shall not begin to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
   501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
"The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 Type of Misdemeanor                   Maximum Fine
First degree                            $5000.00
Second degree                           4000.00

Minor misdemeanor not                    
specifically classified                 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

upon any unenclosed lands within the Municipality or upon any private property
without the consent of the owner or occupant thereof. (Ord. 2012-15. Passed 4-
24-12.)
   (b)   No person being the owner or having charge of any dog, whether

      (3)   Anyone who is walking a dog in a public place or away from the
premises where the dog is normally confined shall have the dog secured by a
strap or chain. An electronic collar or similar device does not fulfill this
requirement and does not comply with this code section. The strap or chain used
to control the dog must be securely attached to the dog so the person
controlling the dog has immediate and full physical control of the dog,
enabling the person to not only restrain the dog but to be able to pull the dog
away from other pets or people.
         (Ord. 2020-51. Passed 11-10-20.)

or fowl shall permit them to run at large so as to do damage to gardens, lawns,

damaged by any cat, dog or other animal or fowl, the person owning or harboring
such cat, dog, animal or fowl, is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. (Ord. 66-48.

   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
   505.02 IMPOUNDING AND DISPOSITION.
   The Safety-Service Director shall cause to be impounded every dog, cat or
other animal found in violation of Section
505.01. If such dog is found not wearing a valid dog license tag, the Safety-
Service Director shall turn it over forthwith to an officer or society charged
by law with the custody and disposal of such dogs. If such dog, cat or other
animal is wearing a valid dog license tag or the identity of the owner or
custodian is otherwise established, the Safety-Service Director shall
immediately give notice to the licensee, owner or custodian that the dog, cat
or other animal has been impounded. Such notice may be by telephone or by
certified or registered mail to the last known address of such licensee, owner
or custodian. The dog, cat or other animal shall not be released except upon
the payment of reasonable expenses for its taking and keeping. The charge for
the taking and keeping of such animal shall be fifty dollars ($50.00) for the
first two days, and twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per day thereafter. For a
second impoundment of the same animal within ninety days, or for an impoundment
of a different animal owned by the same individual or family member of the same
individual, the charge shall be doubled to one hundred dollars ($100.00) for
the first two days and fifty dollars ($50.00) per day thereafter.
   Any dog, cat or other animal unclaimed within twenty-four hours after
personal notice or within twenty-four hours after receiving the receipt from
such certified or registered mailing, either indicating delivery or lack of
delivery, shall be sold or otherwise disposed of as provided by law. (Ord. 79-
89. Passed 1-29-80; Ord. 96-69. Passed 11-12-96.)

   (a)   Except for guide dogs registered under Ohio R.C. 955.011 and dogs kept
by an institution or organization for teaching and research purposes under Ohio
R.C. 955.16, no person shall own, keep or harbor a dog more than three months
of age without annually registering such dog with the County Auditor. Failure
of any dog at any time to wear a valid registration tag shall be prima-facie
evidence of lack of registration and subject such dog to impounding and
disposition as provided by Ohio R.C. 955.16.

first offense and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree for each subsequent
offense.

twenty- eight hours after they are so placed without supplying them with
necessary food, water and attention, nor permit such stock to be so crowded as
to overlie, crush, wound or kill each other.
   (b)    Upon the written request of the owner or person in custody of any
particular shipment of livestock, which written request shall be separate and
apart from any printed bill of lading or other railroad form, the length of
time in which such livestock may be detained in any cars or compartments

the nuisance is a lawful order, and that failure to provide a written plan
could subject the owner to penalties pursuant to Section
521.17(d).
   (c)   Determination That Premises is a Chronic Nuisance. Whenever the City
Safety Service Director or his or her designee determines that an additional
nuisance activity has occurred at a premises for which a notice has been issued
pursuant to Section
521.17(b) and this nuisance activity occurs more than fourteen (14) days after
the notice has been issued, the city solicitor or his or her designee shall
determine that the premises is a chronic nuisance and issue a lawful order that
the owner abate the nuisance within thirty (30) days of the owner's receipt of
the notice. Failure to abate the nuisance shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter.
   The notice and order provided for in this section shall be deemed properly
delivered if sent by first class mail to the address for the owner listed on
the records of the Butler County or Hamilton County auditor. If the notice and
order are returned as undeliverable, the notice and order shall be deemed
properly delivered if they are either posted on the front door or in a
conspicuous location/manner of the premises that is the subject of the notice
and order or if they are delivered in person to the owner or operator.
   *The notice shall contain the following information:
   The street address or legal description sufficient for identification of the
premises;
   A description of the nuisance activity or activities for which the premises
owner is
notified of, including the dates of the nuisance activity or activities;
   An order that the nuisance activity be abated; and
   A statement that the premises owner may appeal the determination that the
owner's premises is a chronic nuisance as provided in Section
521.17(e).
   A determination that a premises is a chronic nuisance subject to fines or
criminal prosecution pursuant Section
521.17(d) shall be effective against the owner until the nuisance is abated
under the thresholds established in Section
521.17(b)
   (d)   Citations For Multiple Nuisance Activities; Penalties. Whoever
violates this chapter or fails to obey any lawful order issued by the City
Safety Services Director or his or her designee to abate a chronic nuisance
within thirty (30) days or to provide a written plan to abate the nuisance
activities within ten (10) days, is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree
on the first offense and guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree on the
second and subsequent offense. Each day's continuation of a violation or
failure to comply is a separate offense.
   With regard to any premises or unit where a violation occurs that
constitutes a nuisance activity, that premises or unit shall be a public
nuisance subject to abatement pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Chapter 3767
including, but not limited to, a one year closure of the premises or unit where
the nuisance activity occurred.
   Notwithstanding the requirements of this chapter, the Law Director is
authorized to file
suit under state and local law to abate nuisances existing at property or
premises, including seeking injunctive relief.
   Notwithstanding provisions under Section
521.17(c), no sanctions shall be issued under this Chapter if the owner submits
a written plan; that is approved by the Safety Services Director or his or her
designee, to abate the nuisance activities pursuant to Section
521.17(b) but the premises shall remain subject to abatement under Ohio Revised
Code Chapter 3767.
   (e)   Appeals.  
      (1)   A premises' owner may appeal the determination of the City Safety
Service Director or his or her designee pursuant to Section
521.17(c) that a premises is a chronic nuisance within thirty (30) days from
the date of the notification from the City Safety Services Director or his or
her designee that the premises is a chronic nuisance or within thirty (30) days
from the date the bill or civil citation is issued.
      (2)   Any appeal filed by an owner or operator must perfect that appeal
by filing a request in writing with the Clerk of Council. The Clerk of Council
will then schedule a public hearing to be held at a City Council meeting to be
held within thirty (30) days of the appeal request. A quorum of City Council is
required to proceed with the public hearing. Subsequent to the public hearing,
a vote on the appeal is to be held by City Council with a majority of votes
being needed to overturn the prior decision of the City Safety Service
Director.
   (f)   Rules and Regulations. The City Safety Service Director or his or her
designee shall establish rules, regulations, and policies for the maintenance
of information, notification of violations, determination of when calls for
service are counted for purposes of this ordinance, appeals of decisions made,
training for police officers or other City personnel, and all other relevant
issues necessary for implementation of this chapter.
   (g)   Retaliation Prohibited.
      (1)   Landlord-Tenant Issues (regulated by Ohio R.C. Chapter 5321). It is
understood that there is a substantial interest of a person who is living at a
property as a tenant. Therefore, It shall be unlawful for a landlord to
terminate the lease agreement or periodic tenancy of any tenant without good
cause or otherwise retaliate against any tenant because that tenant complained
to the police or other City official or employee about nuisance or criminal
activities on the landlord's premises or made calls for service to the police
related to nuisance or criminal activities on the landlord's premises. It shall
be unlawful for a landlord or any person acting as an agent for the landlord to
intimidate or actively discourage a tenant and/or persons associated with a
tenant from calling the police to report nuisance activity associated with a
property. It shall be presumed that any attempt to increase charges, reduce
services, or to otherwise harass or retaliate against the tenant during the
twelve (12)-month period following receipt of the complaint by the chief of
police constitutes unlawful retaliation under this section.
         Such presumption shall be rebutted by the preponderance of evidence
that the actions taken by the landlord were based upon good cause. "Good cause"
as used in this subsection means that a landlord must show good cause for his
or her actions, other than one related to or caused by the operation of this
section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tenant's lease agreement or periodic
tenancy may be terminated for a failure to pay rent; committing nuisance
activity as defined in Section
521.17(a); committing waste upon the premises; violating the terms and
conditions of the lease agreement or periodic tenancy; or as otherwise provided
in Ohio R.C. 5321. A landlord's failure to renew a lease agreement or periodic
tenancy upon expiration of such lease agreement or periodic tenancy shall not
be deemed a violation of this subsection.
      (2)   General Property Owner - Operator Issues. It is understood that
Property Owners and Operators have the ability to properly regulate conduct on
their property or premises. Some examples (without being all inclusive) are
ejecting an occupant or person associated with the property or premises who is
violating the rules of the property owner or operator. This can also include
terminating or disciplining an employee who works at the property or premises.
This can include denying a person service who is a customer at the property or
premises. It should be understood that these actions on the part of the
property owner or operator should be in accordance with federal and/or state
law that regulate such actions.
         However, an occupant has a responsibility as a good citizen to report
in good faith crime, disorder, or regulatory violations. These reports allow
the City of Sharonville to regulate conduct that poses a threat to the safety
and health of its citizens. Therefore, it shall be unlawful for an owner, or
operator; or any person acting as an agent for the owner, or operator to
intimidate or actively discourage an occupant and/or persons associated with an
occupant from calling the City of Sharonville to report in good faith a
potential nuisance activity associated with a property.
   (h)   Severability. The provisions of any part of this Chapter are
severable. If any provision or subsection hereof or the application thereof to
any person or circumstances is held invalid, the other provisions, subsection,
and applications of such ordinance to other persons or circumstances shall not
be affected thereby. It is declared to be the intent of this section that the
same would have been adopted had such invalid provisions, if any, not been
included herein
(Ord. 2024-54. Passed 10-8-24.)
   521.18 PROHIBITING SMOKING IN CITY-OWED PLAYGROUND AREAS.
SMOKEFREE PARKS FACT SHEET
Smoke free parks promote healthy living
   •    We go to parks to play with our kids, to participate in sports, or to
relax and enjoy the outdoors. Creating smokefree parks is a way for communities
to make outdoor spaces even more conducive to healthy living,
   •    By passing a law to create smokefree parks, a city or county can take
an important step to encourage healthy behaviors and make parks places where
people can expect to be free from secondhand smoke.
   •    Smokefree environments help adults model healthy behavior for kids, and
can encourage people who smoke to smoke less or even quit.1
It's legal to create smoke free parks
   •    Local governments have the legal right to adopt laws to protect
residents' health and safety. 4 This authority (known as the "police power")
enables communities to adopt smokefree laws to reduce exposure to harmful
secondhand tobacco smoke.
   •    Smoking restrictions do not discriminate against people who smoke.5
There are no constitutional guarantees allowing a person to smoke wherever they
wish.
Exposure to secondhand smoke is unhealthy - even outdoors
   •    Tobacco smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals and compounds,
including hundreds that are toxic and at least 69 that cause cancer. 6
   •    The U.S. Surgeon General has concluded there is no risk free level of
exposure to secondhand smoke:7 Secondhand smoke causes nearly 3,000 deaths from
lung cancer and 46,000 deaths from heart disease every year in the United
States. 8
   •    Studies have found that levels of secondhand smoke in outdoor areas can
be equal to amounts found inside where smoking is allowed. 9
   •    Exposure to concentrated amounts of secondhand smoke outdoors can cause
respiratory irritation and may trigger asthma attacks. 10
   •    To completely avoid exposure to secondhand smoke in an outdoor area, a
person may have to move as far as 25 feet from the person who is smoking -
equivalent to the width of a two-lane road. 11
Smokefree parks mean less litter
   •    Cigarette butts are the most commonly littered item in the United
States. 12 Americans discard more than 175 million pounds of cigarette butts
every year.13
   •    Laws establishing smokefree parks help reduce cigarette butt litter and
its effects on the environment by creating cigarette "butt-free zones" where
this type of trash won't blight outdoor recreational areas and inadvertently
pollute waterways.
   •    The cigarette filter - the white fluffy stuff that looks like cotton -
is actually plastic (cellulose acetate),which can take up to 15 years to
decompose. 14
   •    Cigarette butts get deposited into our streams, creeks, lakes, and
rivers (through storm drains), where they then leach toxins into these
waterways, impairing the water quality for aquatic life. 15
Smokefree parks laws are easy to enforce
   •    Laws restricting smoking in parks are, for the most part, self-
enforcing, which means that people "police" themselves and cooperate with the
law.
   •    When people know they aren't supposed to smoke in a particular place,
they generally comply. Knowledgeable community members also can help educate
those who don't know about the law.
   •    Posting "No Smoking" signs at park entrances, in playground and picnic
areas, and next to sports fields are important ways to provide clear and
constant reminders about the smokefree law.
   •    Media events, press releases, newsletter articles, website highlights,
and brochures are all great ways to inform and remind the public about the
health-promoting policy.

immediate family.
      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.

in danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider

subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal
setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide

   Any individual charged with indirect contempt of court shall have an
opportunity for a hearing, by himself or herself or with the assistance of
counsel, by an entry made upon the Mayor’s court journal. This provision does

Magistrate may elect to reimpose the suspended portion of the sentence if the
Mayor or Magistrate determines that the convicted individual has not complied
with the prior order or conditions imposed upon such individual.
   (e)   Punishment. An individual convicted of direct contempt of court may be
imprisoned for not more than ten days or fined not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00). In the event that the defendant is guilty of contempt of
court which consists of the omission to perform an act which the defendant has
the capability to perform, the defendant may be imprisoned after conviction
until the defendant performs the act. If the defendant has failed to appear
upon the date named, the court may issue an arrest warrant or order the
forfeiture of the appearance bond of the defendant, or both. An individual

      (1)    If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item,
antique, museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is
either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial
time, effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)    If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(l) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)    If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(l) hereof, and
the physical term is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)    As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall

   545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section 545.05, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
 
   545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

Ohio R.C. 4503.182, or any comparable temporary motor vehicle license
registration as prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United

   PREAMBLE: The Municipality has enacted this chapter to efficiently and
adequately regulate the businesses contained herein in order to protect the
community's safety and aesthetic concerns. In addition to possible dangerous
and unsightly conditions these businesses may produce, such business operations
also provide opportunities for a harboring and exchanging of stolen goods, even
if such legal status is unknown to the operator of the business. It has been
determined by this Municipality that these provisions should fairly protect the
interest of the community and the businesses covered herein. In addition, this
chapter regulates uses not permitted under the Municipality's zoning code which
are tolerated only as legal non-conforming uses. Such businesses often involve
outdoor storage of materials which may present health, safety and aesthetic
problems and are illegal under the zoning code.

hearings at such times as it determines to be appropriate. The Board shall make
a determination within thirty days from the conclusion date of any appeal
hearing and variance hearing held before such Board. All deliberation and
discussions by the Board shall be confidential and not subject to public
participation. The failure of the Board to act within the thirty-day period

being sought by the applicant.

determination made by the Safety Service Director or his designate concerning
the enforcement or application of the requirements of Chapter
717 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Sharonville. The Board may
reverse, affirm, modify or otherwise alter the contents and timing of any such
decision. The Board may swear in witnesses, record any such hearings and may
issue findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Board shall allow any
individual to testify at such hearing and to have an authorized agent or
attorney represent such individual at the hearing. The Board shall allow any
such party to subpoena witnesses and to subpoena documents and other tangible
evidence.
   (b)    The Board may authorize variances from the strict application of the
regulations of Chapter
717 by reason of exceptional lot configuration, unusual relationship between
the lot and adjoining properties and adjoining rights of way, or other
extraordinary situations which create an undue hardship based upon the strict
application of Chapter
717. No such variance shall substantially impair the public good or the
aesthetics of the surrounding community or the public safety considerations
benefited by the provisions of Chapter
717. The Board may reverse, affirm, modify or otherwise alter the contents and
timing of any such decision. The Board may swear in witnesses, record any such
hearings and may issue findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Board shall
allow any individual to testify at such hearing and to have an authorized agent
or attorney represent such individual at the hearing. The Board shall allow any
such party to subpoena witnesses and to subpoena documents and other tangible
evidence. A variance maybe granted by the Board if it finds by a preponderance
of the evidence that all of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   The granting of the variance is reasonably necessary to relieve a
hardship, to preserve the applicant’s right to continue operating a legal and
conforming business, not merely for the financial or practical convenience of
the applicant.
      (2)   The requested variance shall not constitute an increase in the
nonconforming use of the regulated business without proof that such extension
of a nonconforming use has been approved by the Sharonville Planning Commission
pursuant to the Zoning Code of the City of Sharonville.
      (3)   That special circumstances or conditions apply to the property and
the business in question and are unique to such property.
      (4)   That the special circumstances which are unique to the property in
question are not the result of previous actions taken by the applicant.
      (5)   The aesthetic and safety considerations of adjoining properties,
including public rights of way, will not be detrimentally affected by the
granting of the variance.
In a request for a variance, the applicant shall clearly state in writing the
above five criteria and how the requested variance shall address all of the
required criteria.    
   (c)   After the determination by the Architectural Review Board concerning
appeals and variances, the decision of the Architectural Review Board shall be
final. Any further remedy shall involve Court appeals at the discretion of the
applicant. No further action shall be necessary from the Safety Service
Director, the City Council or any other administrative body of the City of
Sharonville to enact the decision of the Architectural Review Board.
      (Ord. 2002-71. Passed 12-10-02.)

   751.02 INITIAL REVIEW OF BASIC CABLE RATES.
   (a)   Notice. Upon the adoption of this chapter and the certification of the
City by the FCC, the City or the ICRC shall immediately notify all cable
operators in the City, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the
City intends to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier
and associated equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992.
   (b)   Cable Operator Response. Within thirty days of receiving notice from
the City or the ICRC, a cable operator shall file with the City or the ICRC,
its current rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment and any
supporting material concerning the reasonableness of its rates.
   (c)   Expedited Determination and Public Hearing.
      (1)   If Council is able to expeditiously determine that the cable
operator’s rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are within
the FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable benchmark,
Council shall:
         A.   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         B.   Act to approve the rates within thirty days from the date the
cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the City.
      (2)   If Council or the ICRC takes no action within thirty days from the
date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the City, the proposed
rates will continue in effect.
      (3)   Such public hearing may be held in conjunction with other ICRC
communities under the direction of the ICRC.
   (d)   Extended Review Period.
      (1)   If Council is unable to determine whether the rates in issue are
within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or
if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, Council shall, within
sixty days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with
the City and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following
additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination:
         A.   Ninety days if Council needs more time to ensure that a rate is
within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard; or
         B.   150 days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service
showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark.
      (2)   If Council has not made a decision within the ninety or 150 day
period, the City Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the
period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts
received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are
paid.
   (e)   Public Hearing. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the proposed rate, Council or the ICRC shall hold at least one public
hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
   (f)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed initial basic rate may request the secretary to record the
objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing
anytime before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to
be made part of the record, the objector must provide the secretary with the
objector’s name and address.
   (g)   Benchmark Analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic
cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC’s reasonable rate
standard, Council or the ICRC shall review the rates using the benchmark
analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on
the Council or the ICRC’s findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be
established as follows:
      (1)   If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those
rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator’s rates
will be capped at that level.
      (2)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates
shall be the greater of the cable operator’s per channel rate on September 30,
1992, reduced by ten percent (10%), or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for
inflation and any change in the number of channels occurring between September
30, 1992 and the initial date of regulation.
      (3)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the
cable operator’s per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30,
1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for
inflation.
   (h)   Cost-of-Service Showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce
the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity
to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic
cable rates above the FCC’s reasonable rate standard. Council will review a
cost-of-service review. Council may approve initial basic cable rates above the
benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-
of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the
cable operator’s September 30, 1992 rates minimum ten percent (10%), will
prescribe the cable operator’s new rates.
   (i)   Decision.
      (1)   By Formal Resolution. After completion by the City or the ICRC of
its review of the cable operator’s proposed rates, Council shall adopt its
decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the following:
         A.   If the proposal is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard or
is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, Council shall approve the initial
basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or
         B.   If the proposal is not within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard
and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates,
Council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the FCC’s
reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service analysis.
      (2)   Rollbacks and Refunds. If Council determines that the initial basic
cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable
operator’s cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, Council may order the
rates reduced in accordance with subsections (g) or (h) above, as applicable.
In addition, Council may order the cable operator to pay to subscribers,
refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed at
applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and
additional tax payments), retroactive to September 1, 1993. The method for
paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC
regulations as directed in Council’s decision resolution.
      (3)   Statement of Reasons for Decision and Public Notice. If rates
proposed by a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there
were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution
must state the reasons for the decision and the City Council must give public
notice of its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once in
the official newspaper of the City.
   (j)   Appeal. Council’s decision concerning rates for the basic service tier
or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with
applicable Federal regulations. (Ord. 93-89. Passed 12-28-93.)
   751.03 REVIEW OF REQUEST FOR INCREASE IN BASIC CABLE RATES.
   (a)   Notice. A cable operator in the City who wishes to increase the rates
for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with
the City and the ICRC and notify all subscribers at least thirty days before
the cable operator desires the increase to take effect. This notice may not be
given more often than annually and not until at least one year after the
determination of the initial basic cable rates.
   (b)   Expedited Determination and Public Hearing.
      (1)   If Council or the ICRC is able to expeditiously determine that the
cable operator’s rate increase request for basic cable service is within the
FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap,
Council shall:
         A.   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         B.   Act to approve the rate increase within thirty days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the City.
      (2)   If Council takes no action within thirty days from the date the
cable operator filed its request with the City, the proposed rates will go into
effect.
      (3)   During the extended review period and before taking action on the
proposed rate, Council or the ICRC shall hold at least one public hearing at
which interested persons may express their views and record objections.
   (c)   Extended Review Period.
      (1)   If Council and the ICRC are unable to determine whether the rate
increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, Council
shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional
periods of time as applicable, to make a final determination:
         A.   Ninety days if Council or the ICRC needs more time to ensure that
the requested increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard as
determined by the applicable price cap; and
         B.   150 days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service
showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap.
      (2)   The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review
period.
      (3)   If Council has not made a decision within the 90 to 150 day period,
Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting
the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason
of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are paid.
   (d)   Public Hearing. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the requested rate increase, Council or the ICRC shall hold at least
one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and
record objections.
   (e)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed rate increase may request the secretary to record the objection
during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before
the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part
of the record, the objector must provide the secretary with the objector’s name
and address.
   (f)   Delayed Determination. If Council is unable to make a final
determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time
period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to
subsequent refund if Council later issued a decision disapproving any portion
of the increase.
   (g)   Price Cap Analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a
rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC’s price cap, Council shall
review the rate using a price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form
authorized by the FCC. Based on Council’s findings, the basic cable rates shall
be established as follows:
      (1)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap
established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable
rates.
      (2)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap
established by the FCC, Council shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and
order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap.
   (h)   Cost-of-Service Showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-
service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap,
Council will review the submission pursuant to the FCC standards for cost-of-
service review. Council may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the
cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service
determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable
operator’s then current rate will prescribe the cable operator’s new rate.
   (i)   Decision. Council’s decision concerning the requested rate increase,
shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by a cable
operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made by
other parties to the proposed rate increases, the resolution must state the
reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a
person requesting the city secretary to record the objection or may be
submitted in writing at anytime before the decision resolution is adopted.
   (j)   Refunds.
      (1)   Council may order refunds of subscribers’ rate payments with
interest if:
         A.   Council was unable to make a decision within the extended time
period as described in subsection (c) above; and
         B.   The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of
the extended review period; and
         C.   Council determines that the rate increase as submitted exceeds
the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify the rate
increase by a cost-of-service showing, and Council disapproves any portion of
the rate increase.
      (2)   The method of paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in Council’s decision resolution.
   (k)   Appeal. Council’s decision concerning rates for the basic service tier
or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with
applicable federal regulations. (Ord. 93-89. Passed 12-28-93.)
   751.04 CABLE OPERATOR INFORMATION.
   (a)   City May Require.
      (1)   In those cases when the cable operator has submitted initial rates
or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, Council or

that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a rate
determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request the information be
kept confidential in accordance with this section.

   (a)    No person, other than the duly authorized employees of the
Municipality, shall make any opening in the pavement of any street, alley,
sidewalk or public way, unless a permit to make such opening has been issued.
(Ord. 685. Passed 8-19-41.)
   (b)    A fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) shall be charged at the time the
permit is issued to cover the costs of inspection and supervision of the

(Ord. 87-7. Passed 2-24-87.)
   901.02 APPLICATION; SECURITY FOR RESTORATION.
   Permits for making openings in Municipal streets, sidewalks and public ways,
shall be issued only by the Sharonville Community Services Director or the
Safety-Service Director or his or her agent for some duly authorized purpose.
Applications for street opening permits shall be made on forms provided by the
Municipality. The application shall give the size and location of the proposed
opening and shall state the kind of paving where the cut is to be made. The
permit shall be issued only after ample security has been given the
Municipality to insure the proper restoration and subsequent maintenance of the
street pavement disturbed. Such security may be furnished in one of the
following ways:
   (a)    A cash deposit or a surety bond shall be posted with each
application, sufficient to cover the cost of restoration.
   (b)    In the case of Municipal contracts involving the cutting of street
pavements, permits may be issued without a cash deposit or surety bond but in
such cases, sufficient money to pay for the necessary street restoration shall
be withheld from the contract moneys owing to the contractor, until such street
restoration is completed by the contractor to the satisfaction of Council, or
until such contractor shall have paid the requisite amount for the street
restoration to the Municipality. (Ord. 685. Passed 8-19-41; Ord. 87-7. Passed
2-4-87.)
   901.03 PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATIONS.
   Public service corporations may do their own restoration work in connection
with the opening of streets for maintenance and construction work, and may
obtain permits to open streets without cash deposits, but such permits shall be
issued only when the restoration work is promptly done, and when the subsequent
opening proceeds at a rate no faster than the previous restoration. (Ord. 685.
Passed 8-19-41.)
   901.04 NOTICE TO PROPERTY OWNERS.
   Previous to the paving, repair, resurfacing or reconstruction of any street
or public way, the Safety-Service Director shall, under the direction of
Council, cause notices to be sent to all abutting property owners requiring
them to install any needed water or sewer service branches. Notice shall also
be sent to all public service corporations to install all necessary mains,
conduits, service branches and structures. Property owners and public service
corporations shall be allowed the necessary and reasonable time required for
the aforesaid installations before the new pavement is laid. Thereafter, during
the period of three years from the final completion and acceptance of the new
pavement, no permit for making any opening in such pavement shall be issued,
except by express authority from Council. Council shall exercise this special
authority only for reasons of public necessity or for undue private hardship
where the necessity for the opening arises from causes over which the applicant
has no control. Lack of foresight in not installing service connections prior
to the laying of a new pavement or the repairing or resurfacing of a pavement
shall not be considered an adequate reason for abrogation of the general rule.
In all cases where a street opening permit shall be issued during the three
year period, an additional suitable charge in excess of the scheduled rate,
shall be assessed. (Ord. 685. Passed 8-19-41.)
   901.99 PENALTY.

(Ord. 2001-49-E. Passed 8-28-01.)
   903.04 NATURE OF ISSUANCE.
   A Certificate of Registration shall not convey equitable or legal title in

limited right to occupy Rights of Way in the City for the limited purposes and
for the limited period stated in the Certificate of Registration and in
accordance with Codified Ordinances Chapter
903  and all Laws including any Ru1es and Regu1ations adopted by the City
Safety Service Director. The rights to locate Facilities and/or a System in and
the rights to occupy the Right of Way itself may not be subdivided or
subleased; provided, however provider may sublease capacity (or other
nonmaterial Facility aspects) and two or more Providers may collocate
Facilities in the same area of the Rights of Way so long as each such Provider
complies with the provisions of this Chapter. Collocating Providers may file a
joint application for a Construction Permit. A Certificate of Registration does
not excuse a Provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment
agreements before collocating its Facilities on Facilities of others, including
the City's Facilities. A Certificate of Registration does not prevent a
Provider from leasing space in or on the Provider's System, so long as the
sharing of Facilities does not cause a violation of Law, including the
provisions of this Chapter. A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a
Provider from complying with any provisions of this Chapter or other applicable
Law. (Ord. 2001-49-E. Passed 8-28-01.)
   903.05 OTHER APPROVALS, PERMITS AND AGREEMENTS.
   In addition to a Certificate of Registration, Providers shall obtain any and
all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for
the offering or provision of such Services from the appropriate federal, state
and local authorities and upon the City's reasonable request, shall provide
copies of such documents to the City. Further, a Certificate of Registration
issued pursuant to this Chapter shall not entitle a Provider to use, alter,
convert to, or interfere with, the Facilities, easements, poles, conduits,
lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable, or any other real or personal property
of any kind whatsoever under the management or control of the City.

payment is not made.
   903.08.5 No Accord and Satisfaction. 
   No acceptance by the City of any Registration Maintenance Fee shall be
construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor
shall such acceptance of such Registration Maintenance Fee payment be construed
as a release of any claim the City may have for additional sums payable.
   903.08.6 Costs of Publication.

new or additional Facilities within the Rights of Way if the Right of Way is
Full. In making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the Rights of Way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety, and welfare,
the condition of the Rights of Way, the time of year, the protection of
existing Facilities in the Rights of Way, future City and County plans for
public improvements, development projects which have been determined to be in
the public interest, and the non-discriminatory and competitively neutral
treatment of providers.
   (c)   Upon the concurrence of the City, or if it is determined by the
Construction Permittee and any appropriate local, state, or federal agency (or
other entity with jurisdictional authority) that any existing poles in the

removal and/or relocation, the City shall waive all applicable Construction
Permit Fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the Provider shall restore the
Rights of Way to a condition at least as good as its condition immediately
prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are required to be
removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be replaced with
reasonably obtainable poles of the same or similar size unless otherwise
permitted by the City. The City may request relocation and/or removal in order
to prevent unreasonable interference by the Provider's Facilities with:
      (1)    A public improvement undertaken or approved by the City, City, or
County;
      (2)    When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the Rights of Way.
   (b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Provider who has Facilities in the

   (c)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the City, a Provider fails to
commence the removal process and/or relocation of its Facilities as designated
by the City, within thirty (30) days after the City's removal order is served
upon Provider, or if a Provider fails to substantially complete such removal,
including all associated repair of the Rights of Way of the City, within twelve
(12) months thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable
Law, the City shall have the right to:
      (1)    Declare that all rights, title and interest to the Facilities
belong to the City with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to,
the right to connect and use the Facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the Facilities to another Person for operation; or
      (2)    Authorize removal of the Facilities installed by the Provider in,
on, over or under the Rights of Way of the City at Provider's cost and expense,
by another Person, however the City shall have no liability for any damage
caused by such action and the Provider shall be liable to the City for all
reasonable costs incurred by the City in such action; and
      (3)    To the extent consistent with applicable Law, any portion of the
Provider's Facilities in, on, over or under the Rights of Way of the City
designated by the City for removal and not timely removed by the Provider shall
belong to and become the property of the City without payment to the Provider,
and the Provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the City shall
request, in form and substance acceptable to the City, to evidence such

paving and its foundations in accordance with the standards established by the
City Safety Service Director, subject to any applicable Laws. The Permittee
must also inspect the area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the
same condition for twelve (12) months thereafter.
   (b)   In approving an Application for a Permit, the City may choose either
to have the Permittee restore the Rights of Way or the City may restore the
Rights of Way itself at the expense of the Permittee.
   (c)   If the City chooses to allow Permittee to restore the Rights of Way,
Construction Permittee shall at the time of Application of a Construction
Permit post a Construction Bond in an amount determined by the City to be
sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the Rights of Way to a condition at
least as good as its condition immediately prior to Construction. If, twelve

the Construction Bond shall be released.
   (d)   The Permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified and approved by the City.

Failure to pay, the City may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by
Permittee and/or pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies.
   903.18.10 Damage to Provider's Facilities and to Other Facilities.
   (a)   In the case of an Emergency, and if possible after reasonable efforts
to contact the Provider seeking a timely response, when the City performs work
in the Rights of Way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a
Provider's Facilities to protect those Facilities, the costs associated
therewith will be billed to that Provider and shall be paid within thirty (30)
days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the City may pursue all
legal and equitable remedies in the event a Provider does not pay or the City
may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by Permittee and pursue any
and all legal or equitable remedies.
   (b)   Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any

and conditions of the Permit and/or this Chapter.
   (d)   The Inspector may issue an order to correct work which does not
conform to the Permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. The
order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for

and by considerations relating to the public health, safety, and welfare.
   903.20.2 Permissive Denial. 
   The Safety Service Director may deny a Permit in order to protect the public
health, safety, and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and
convenience of ordinary travel over the Rights of Way, or when necessary to
protect the Rights of Way and its users. The Safety Service Director, in his or
her discretion, may consider one or more of the following factors: the extent
to which Rights of Way space where the Permit is sought is available; the
competing demands for the particular space in the Rights of Way; the
availability of other locations in the Rights of Way or in other Rights of Way
for the proposed Facilities; the applicability of this Chapter or other
regulations of the Rights of Way that affect location of Facilities in the
Rights of Way; the degree of compliance of the Provider with the terms and
conditions of this Chapter and its requirements, and other applicable
ordinances and regulations; the degree of disruption to surrounding communities

to that part of the public served by the expansion into additional parts of the
Rights of Way; and whether such Applicant or its agent has failed within the
past three (3) years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance, with
the requirements of this Chapter or, if applicable, any other Chapters of the
Codified Ordinances, or any other applicable Law.

practicable, notify the Department of Community Development of any event
regarding its Facilities which it considers to be an Emergency. The Provider

Emergency. Within two (2) business days, unless otherwise extended by the City
Safety Service Director, after the occurrence or discovery of the Emergency
(whichever is later), the Provider shall apply for the necessary Permits, pay
the fees associated therewith and fulfill all the requirements necessary to

the Provider or System Representative of each Provider affected, or potentially
affected, by the Emergency. In any event, the City may take whatever action it
deems necessary in order to respond to the Emergency, the cost of which shall
be borne by the Provider whose Facilities caused the Emergency.
   (b)   Non-Emergency Situations. Except in the case of an Emergency, any
Provider who Constructs in, on, above, within, over, below or through a Right
of Way without a valid Permit shall subsequently obtain a Permit, pay double

damage to the Rights of Way and comply with all of the requirements of this
Chapter.

a privilege and not as a right. The City reserves the right, as provided
herein, to revoke any Permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any Law or any provision or
condition of the Permit. A substantial breach by Permittee shall include, but

committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any Law or any
provision or condition of the Permit, the Safety Service Director shall serve a
written demand upon the Permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the Permit.
Upon, a substantial breach, as stated above, the Safety Service Director, may
place additional or revised conditions on the Permit. Any obligation of the
Safety Service Director in this Section and within this Chapter may be carried
out by a designated official of the Safety Service Director, including a third
party engineering firm if the Safety Service Director so directs.
   (c)   By the close of the next business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, Permittee shall contact the Safety Service Director
with a plan, acceptable to the Safety Service Director, for its correction.
Permittee's failure to so contact the Safety Service Director, or the
Permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or Permittee's failure to
reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation
of the Permit.
   (d)   From time to time, the Safety Service Director may establish a list of
standard conditions for the Permit. A substantial breach of any condition shall
also constitute an unauthorized use of the public Rights of Way as defined in
Section
903.14 .
   (e)   If a Permittee, commits a second substantial breach as outlined above,
Permittee's Permit will automatically be revoked and not be allowed further
Permits for one full year, except for Emergency repairs.
   (f)   If a Permit is revoked, the Permittee shall also reimburse the City
for the City's reasonable costs, including Restoration costs and the costs of
collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in com1ection with such
revocation.

considered as a revocable Permit with a mutual right in either party to
terminate without cause upon giving sixty (60) days written notice to the
other. The requirements and conditions of such a revocable Permit shall be the
same requirements and conditions as set forth in the Permit, right or
registration, respectively, except for conditions relating to the term of the

      (Ord. 2018-23-E. Passed 7-17-18.)
904.15 DESIGN AND SITING REQUIREMENTS.
   General Requirements.
   (a)   Wireless support structures shall align with other poles to achieve a
uniform inline appearance.
   (b)   Wireless support structures shall be setback from the edge of pavement
according to applicable safety and construction standards as set forth in
904.14(a).
   (c)   All small cell facilities and wireless support structures and any
related items shall be installed and maintained plumb and level and shall
maintain an orderly and neat appearance.
   (d)   The City may deny requests to install structures and facilities in the
right-of-way in an area where the City has required all structures and
facilities except those owned by the City to be placed underground or elsewhere
in the right-of-way or utility easement. These areas can be easily identifiable
as those locations where electric has been placed underground, such as within
the Northern Lights Entertainment District; however, if an applicant is
uncertain as to whether such facilities have been placed underground in the
area, the applicant should contact the City for clarification before applying
for or installing any wireless support structures and/or or small cell
facilities in the area. The applicant may request a waiver if unable to achieve
its service objective using a location in the right-of-way where the
prohibition does not apply, in a utility easement the applicant has the right
to access, or in or on other suitable locations or structures made available by
the City at reasonable rates, fees and terms.
   (e)   In residential districts, new wireless support structures should be
located to avoid obstructing the view of building facades by placing the
wireless support structure at a corner, intersection or along a lot line. New
wireless support structures should be located in the yard location where other
overhead utilities are located unless it is not technically feasible to do so.
Applicants shall clearly explain the rationale for requests that deviate from
this expectation.
   (f)   In the Downtown District, when collocating on the City's ornamental
black traffic signal mast arms, the preferred collocation spot is on the
traffic signal pole without attached street signs, with the antenna placed at
the top of the vertical pole immediately below the finial. Each proposed
collocation will be subject to a site-specific review. The City strongly
discourages the use of the City's ornamental green streetlights as wireless
support structures. They should be used only when no other options exist,
including the ability to install a new wireless support structure. If used, the
height may not be increased more than five (5) feet, the light fixture must be
located at the top of the pole, and the small cell facility must not interfere
with the attachment of flags, hanging planters and/or banners. If existing
utility poles are not available for collocation, applicants may propose a new
wireless support structure. Wireless support structures that will be more than
twenty (20) feet in height shall match the design of the City's ornamental
black traffic signal mast arms. New wireless support structures that will be
twenty (20) feet or less in heights shall match the City's ornamental green
streetlights. Applicants should look to the rear of properties. In order to
meet the service needs of applicants, the City will consider requests to locate
small cell facilities on City property in the downtown area, such as parking
lots.
   (g)   All equipment and enclosures shall be attached, anchored and/or
strapped tightly to poles using corrosion resistant steel hardware.
   (h)   Wireless support structures shall support no more than two small cell
facilities.
   (i)   A landscaping plan, approved by the Community Development Director
shall be required for each Application. Facilities shall be camouflaged using
existing land forms, vegetation and structures to screen the facilities from
view and to blend in with surrounding built and natural environment. The City
may require additional concealment elements before approving an application,
especially in residential districts. Concealment elements may include, but
shall not be limited to, fencing, public art, or strategic placement.
   (j)   Ambient noise suppression measures or placement of the equipment in
locations less likely to impact adjacent properties shall be required to ensure
compliance with all applicable noise regulations.
   (k)   Unless otherwise required for compliance with FAA or FCC regulations,
the small cell facility or wireless support structure shall not include any
permanently installed lights. Any lights associated with the equipment shall be
appropriately shielded from public view. This shall not be interpreted to
prohibit streetlights or the placement of luminaires by the City.
Location
   (a)   In accordance with ORC 4939.0314(D), Authority of a Municipal
Corporation, the City shall reserve the right to propose an alternate location
to the proposed location of a new wireless support structure, provided the
alternate location is within 100' or a distance equal to the width of the Right
of Way in or on which the new wireless support structure is proposed, whichever
is greater. The City of Sharonville also finds that certain locations and
collocation configurations are preferred. A preferred location and collocation
configuration should be utilized whenever possible and should only be surpassed
if in the determination of the Public Works Director, clear and convincing
evidence supports such a decision. Cost alone should not be grounds for such a
determination. The order of preference is as follows:
      (1)   First, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole or wireless structure within a utility easement. If so such pole or
wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
      (2)   Second, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole or wireless support structure within an alley. If no such pole or wireless
support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
      (3)   Third, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new wireless
support structure within a utility easement. If no such location is available
then proceed to the next preference;
      (4)   Fourth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within an alley. If no such location is available
then proceed to the next preference;
      (5)   Fifth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a wireless
support structure currently supporting a small cell facility located within the
City Right of Way. If no such wireless support structure is available then
proceed to the next preference;
      (6)   Sixth, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole located within the City Right of Way. If no such existing pole is
available then proceed to the next preference;
      (7)   Seventh, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within a utility easement. If no such
location is available then proceed to the next preference;
      (8)   Eighth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within an alley. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference
      (9)   Ninth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new wireless
support structure located within the City Right of Way.
   (b)   Any new wireless support structure shall be located at least 500' from
any existing small cell facility.
Wireless Facilities Design
   (a)   Wireless support structures shall be subject to the following design
standards:
      (1)   Wireless support structures shall be limited to 40 feet in height.
      (2)   Wireless support structures shall be capable of supporting at least
two small cell facility operators.
      (3)   New wireless support structures shall have the following design
elements:
         A.   Material - aluminum poles;
         B.   Color - black anodized;
         C.   Diameter - 12 inches;
         D.   Style - smooth round tapered profile;
         E.   Base - trapezoidal pedestal base on a reinforced concrete
footing/foundation pier;
         F.   Exception - If the aesthetics and character of the immediate area
would be better matched by a pole of a different material, color, style, or
base as determined by the Public Works Director, then such design elements may
be substituted with an alternate design element. Such determination shall be
based on the following factors:
            1.   The design features of nearby poles serving in a similar
capacity;
            2.   The design features of the existing or proposed streetscape,
district, or site;
            3.   The historical context of a district or specific site;
            4.   A desire to camouflage or conceal the pole from view.
   (b)   Small cell facilities shall be subject to the following design
standards:
      (1)   The City reserves the right to require the following:
         A.   Antenna and all associated equipment shall be concealed to the
extent deemed necessary by the Public Works Director in response to the
aesthetic context of the small cell facility. Some possible configurations
include but shall not be limited to the following:
            1.   Antenna(s) associated with the first fitting on a wireless
support structure shall be top-mounted and concealed within a radome that also
conceals the cable connections, antenna mount and other hardware. The Public
Works Director may approve a side-mounted antenna with the initial fitting if,
in the [Decision Maker]'s discretion, the side-mounted antenna would be a
better match to the aesthetics and character of the immediate area and would
promote the purposes of this Chapter.
            2.   GPS antennas be placed within the radome or directly above the
radome not to exceed six inches.
      (2)   Each Antenna and all associated equipment shall not exceed 6 cubic
feet in volume.
      (3)   All portions of a Small Cell Facility other than an antenna and as
identified by the ORC 4939.01 (P)2, shall not exceed 28 cubic feet in volume
per facility.
      (4)   Small cell facilities mounted to a wireless support structure shall
be completely concealed within a common enclosure capable of containing at
least two small sell facilities. Such common enclosures shall:
         A.   not exceed 21 cubic feet in volume;
         B.   not exceed 90 inches in height, 20 inches in width, or 20 inches
in depth;

the equipment cannot feasibly be pole-mounted, placed in an underground vault,
or hidden within or integrated into an existing streetscape element (i.e. - bus
stop shelter). Increased costs alone shall not be a consideration. If a ground
mounted enclosure is approved, the [Decision Maker] shall reserve the right to
require any of the following conditions:
            1.   Concealed Enclosure - All equipment shall be completely
concealed within a metal, composite, or equivalent material enclosure as
determined by the Public Works Director.

   (a)   The provisions in
904.15 shall not limit City Administration's discretion to promulgate and make
publicly available other information, materials, or requirements in addition
to, and separate from, these design guidelines so long as the information,
materials, or requirements do not conflict with state or federal law.
   
   (b)   The City Administration shall have the authority to update or
supplement the Design Guidelines to address relevant changes in law,

904.16 MINOR TECHNICAL EXCEPTIONS AND WAIVERS.
   (a)   The City recognizes that in some circumstances strict compliance with
these conditions and guidelines may result in undesirable aesthetic outcomes
and that minor deviations should be granted when the need for such deviation
arises from circumstances outside the applicant's control. In the event that
any applicant asserts that strict compliance with any provision in these
conditions and guidelines, as applied to a specific proposed small cell
facility, would effectively prohibit the provision of personal wireless
services, the City may grant a limited, one-time exemption from strict
compliance.
(Ord. 2018-23-E. Passed 7-17-18.)
904.17 RECOVERY OF COSTS.
   (a)   Application processing fee - for processing an application, the City
shall charge a fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) for each small cell
facility and wireless support structure requested. The City may adjust this fee
ten percent (10%) every five (5) years, rounded up to the nearest five dollars
($5).
   (b)   Annual collocation fee - for operator's attachment of small cell
facilities to wireless support structures owned or operated by the City and
located in the right-of-way, the City shall charge an annual fee of two hundred
dollars ($200.00) per small cell facility so attached. The City may adjust this
fee ten percent (10%) every five (5) years, rounded to the nearest five dollars
($5). (Ord. 2018-23-E. Passed 7-17-18.)
904.18 RESERVATION OF RIGHT OF WAY.
   (a)   The City reserves the right to reserve space for future public safety
or transportation uses in the right-of-way or on a wireless support structure
or pole owned or operated by the City in a documented and approved plan in
place at the time an application is filed. A reservation of space shall not
preclude placement of a pole or collocation of a small cell facility. If
replacement of the City's pole or wireless support structure is necessary to
accommodate the collocation of the small cell facility and the future use, the
small cell facility operator shall pay for the replacement of the pole or
wireless support structure, and the replaced pole or wireless support structure
must accommodate the future use.
(Ord. 2018-23-E. Passed 7-17-18.)
904.19 NONCONFORMITY.
   (a)   A nonconforming small cell facility and/or wireless support structure

compliance with all of the provisions of this chapter, and all other applicable
City laws and ordinances or be removed if any of the following conditions are
present:
      (1)   The nonconforming small cell facility and/or wireless support
structure or a part of the nonconforming small cell facility and/or wireless
support structure is altered, modified, relocated, replaced, or changed in any
manner whatsoever;
      (2)   The nonconforming small cell facility and/or wireless support
structure is damaged or deteriorated and requires any process of
reconstruction, repair, maintenance, or restoration, and the cost of said
reconstruction, repair, maintenance, or restoration exceeds fifty percent of
the small cell facility and/or wireless support structure's replacement cost;
      (3)   The nonconforming small cell facility and/or wireless support
structure is abandoned.
         (Ord. 2018-23-E. Passed 7-17-18.)

must procure and provide to the city a bond, or must provide proof of an
equivalent financial mechanism, to ensure compliance with all provisions of
Chapter
904. The bond or equivalent financial method must specifically cover the cost
of removal of unused or abandoned small cell facilities and/ or wireless
support structures or damage to city property caused by an operator or its
agent of each small cell facility and/ or wireless support structure in case
the city has to remove or pay for its removal. Two acceptable alternatives to a
bond include a funds set-aside and a letter of credit. (Ord. 2018- 23-E. Passed
7-17-18.)
904.21 CONFLICT WITH OTHER PROVISIONS.
   In the event that any other applicable law or code requires any more
restrictive requirements, the most restrictive requirement shall control.
(Ord. 2018-23-E. Passed 7-17-18.)
904.22 SEVERABILITY.
   The provisions of any part of this chapter are severable. If any provision
or subsection, or the application of any provision or subsection to any person
or circumstances, is held invalid, the remaining provisions, subsection, and
applications of such ordinance to other persons or circumstances shall not be
made invalid as well. It is declared to be the intent of this section that the
remaining provisions would have been adopted had such invalid provisions not
been included in this chapter when originally adopted by Council.

904.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person in violation of any of the terms of this chapter, or who,
being the owner or agent of the owner of any lot, tract, or parcel of land,
shall suffer or permit another to erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, repair,
convert, attach, or maintain any such facility, shall be deemed to have
violated the provisions hereof and commits a minor misdemeanor each day during
the period such violation continues.
   (b)   If any utility installation is erected, constructed, reconstructed,
altered, repaired, converted, attached, or maintained in violation of this
chapter or of any regulations made pursuant hereto, the proper officer of the
City, in addition to other remedies, may institute in the name of the City any
appropriate action or proceeding, whether by legal process or otherwise, to
prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration,
repair, conversion, maintenance, attachment, or use, to restrain, correct, or
abate such violation, to prevent the use of such utility installation, and/or
to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business, or use in or about such utility
installation.

(Ord. 2018-23-E. Passed 7-17-18.)
CHAPTER 905
Mailboxes
905.01    Repair or replacement of resident mailboxes damaged by City snow plow
operations.
   905.01 REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF RESIDENT MAILBOXES DAMAGED BY CITY SNOW PLOW
OPERATIONS.
   (a)   If a mailbox is damaged by City snowplowing, residents should, as soon
as the damage occurs, contact the Public Works Department to request a repair
evaluation. In all cases, claims shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the
alleged damage.
   (b)   Upon evaluation, attempts will be made to temporarily repair the
mailbox so mail can be received. If minor damage has occurred, a permanent
repair may occur at that time, with a letter being left stating that a repair
has been completed or if the mailbox and/or mailbox post needs to be completely
replaced. Mailbox repairs will occur as soon as reasonably possible.
   (c)   If replacement is needed, residents generally have two options: Option
A - the resident may replace the mailbox, submitting the letter left regarding
the damage, along with a name, address, and telephone number with a paid
receipt to the Public Works Department for reimbursement up to eighty dollars
($80.00). Mailboxes must be installed to United States Postal Service
specifications (e.g., installed at a height of forty-one to forty-five (41-45)
inches from the road surface to the bottom of the mailbox or point of mail
entry, along with being set-back six to eight (6-8) inches from the front face
of curb or road edge to the mailbox door). An inspection will occur before
reimbursement. Option B - the resident may request that the city install a
standard metal mailbox and/or wood post at no cost to the resident.
Installation will be per United States Postal Service requirements.
   (d)   In special circumstances, the above approach may not be sufficient to
address a particular issue, such as when residents have chosen to install a
decorative or expensive mailbox that has been damaged. Although decorative or
expensive mailboxes are currently permitted within the City, they are not a
requirement for mail delivery. When a resident would like the City to consider
an alternate approach under these circumstances, contact should be made to the
Public Works Director, who will discuss the particulars with the resident. The
City's policy is to reimburse the resident for expenses upon confirmation that
United States Postal Service requirements regarding mailbox placement have been
met. The City may choose to reduce costs of the replacement with City
installation by the Public Works Department. In this case, United States Postal
Service regulations must also be complied with. Special circumstances will only
be considered once per property owner with any subsequent mailbox damage
reverting back to subsections (b) and (c) hereof for resolution. For subsequent
issues, subsection (d) hereof will not be considered because the property owner
is on notice of this policy. (Ord. 2023-19. Passed 3-28-23.)

of base zoning districts where both districts affect the use of lots subject to
those districts.
      (3)   Where land is classified into an overlay zoning district as well as
a base zoning district, the regulations governing development in the overlay
district shall apply in addition to the regulations governing the underlying
base district. In the event of an expressed conflict between the standards of
the overlay zoning district and the base zoning district, the standards
governing the overlay district shall control.
   (c)   References to Previous Zoning Districts. Some of the district
classifications and names established within this code differ from previous
versions of this code. Table 1103-2 identifies how each of the previous
district classifications were renamed in this code. This table shall be used

hereafter referred to as the "zoning map." The zoning map, including any
notations, shall be incorporated and made a part of this code.
   (b)   Interpretation of Zoning District Boundaries. Where uncertainty exists
with respect to the boundaries of the various districts as shown on the zoning
map, the following rules apply:
      (1)   Where zoning district boundary lines are indicated as approximately
following a lot line, such lot line shall be the zoning district boundary.
      (2)   Where zoning district boundary lines are indicated as approximately
following a center line of a street or highway, alley, railroad easement, or
other right-of-way, or a river, creek, or other watercourse, such centerline
shall be the zoning district boundary. In the event of a natural change in the
location of such streams, rivers, or other water courses, the zoning district
boundary shall be construed as moving with the channel centerline.
      (3)   Where zoning district boundary lines are indicated as approximately
following City limits, such City limits shall be the zoning district boundary.
      (4)   When the actual street, right-of-way, property line boundary, or
other existing ground condition is in conflict with that shown on the zoning
map, the Director of Community Development shall provide the necessary
interpretation. The person contesting the location of the district boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to submit technical evidence to
illustrate the boundary.
   (c)   Zoning of Vacated Properties. Whenever any street, alley, or other
public right-of-way is vacated in a manner authorized by law, the zoning
district adjoining each side of such street, alley, or public right-of-way
shall be automatically extended to the center of such vacation and all areas
included in the vacation shall then and henceforth be subject to all
regulations of the extended district.
   (d)   Zoning of Annexed Territories. All territory which may hereinafter be
annexed to the City, if already zoned, shall be continued in its existing
zoning classification until amended in conformance with the procedures outlined
in Section
1129.03.

1129.04.). Conditional uses may be subject to use-specific standards as
identified in the last column of Table 1105-1. Conditional uses are subject to
all other applicable standards of this code.
         B.   The existence or lack of additional use-specific standards for
conditional uses in this code shall not be implied to be the only standards the
conditional use is required to meet. Any conditional use listed in the table
shall be subject to the general review standards for all conditional uses
established in Section
1129.04(d).
         C.   Where a use is listed as PS/C, there may be certain circumstances
in which a conditional use approval may be required rather than the use being
permitted with standards. The specific approval required shall be as
established in the use-specific standards.
      (4)   Overlay Districts.
         A.   Table 1105-1 includes a column for the Northern Lights Overlay
District (NLO) because the NLO alters how uses allowed in underlaying base
zoning districts per the following:
            i.   Where a use is permitted (P), permitted with standards (PS),
conditional (C), or prohibited (XX) in the NLO District under Table 1105-1,
then such use is permitted or prohibited, as applicable, in the NLO District
regardless of how it is allowed or if it prohibited in the underlying base
zoning district.
            ii.   A "UD" in a cell under the NLO District establishes that the
use is permitted in the same manner as the underlying zoning district.
         B.   Uses in the Reading Road Gateway North Overlay District (RRO) are
allowed pursuant to underlying base zoning district.
         C.   See Chapter
1107: Overlay Zoning Districts for additional standards related to all overlay
zoning districts.
      (5)   Prohibited Uses (XX).
         A.   An "XX" in a cell indicates that a use is specifically prohibited
in the applicable zoning district.
         B.   Any use not specifically listed in the table shall be considered
prohibited unless approved as a similar use (See Section
1105.02(d).) or through a code text amendment.
         C.   There may be districts where a specified use is prohibited either
by an overlay zoning district or by the use-specific standards referenced in
the last column of Table 1105-1.
         D.   The following uses are specifically prohibited in the City of
Sharonville and may not be approved as a similar use in accordance with Section
1105.02(d):
            i.   Medical marijuana dispensary;
            ii.   Medical marijuana cultivation;
            iii.   Medical marijuana processing;
            iv.   Medical marijuana business;
            v.   Battery reclamation or manufacturing, the manufacturing or
processing of regulated substances as the principal activity, the manufacturing
of paints, varnishes, lacquers, and enamels, or any similar type of use that
could potentially create a brownfield site;
            vi.   Transfer, storage, or disposal facilities requiring a permit
under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976;
            vii.   Junk and scrap metal yards, and auto salvage and recycling
yards;
            viii.   Sanitary landfills and solid waste landfills;
            ix.   Construction and demolition debris landfills;
            x.   Correctional institutions;
            xi.   Outdoor storage of goods, materials, or vehicles as the
principal use of a property; and
            xii.   Any gambling activity that is not expressly allowed by state
law within a building or use allowed under this code.
      (6)   Use-Specific Standards.
         A.   The column titled "Use-Specific Standards" includes cross-
references to a section containing standards that apply specifically to the
listed use.
         B.   Use-specific standards shall only apply if the use is permitted
with standards (PS) or is a conditional use (C) in the zoning district.
         C.   Standards referenced in the "Use-Specific Standards" column apply
in all zoning districts unless otherwise expressly stated.
         D.   The land uses and activities covered by this section shall comply
with the applicable use-specific standards in all districts unless otherwise
specified, in addition to all other applicable provisions of this code.
   (c)   Multiple Uses. If multiple uses are proposed on a single lot or in a
single building, then each of the individual uses shall be allowed in the
applicable zoning district and reviewed in accordance with how the individual
use is allowed in the district (i.e., permitted, permitted with standards, or
conditional use).
   (d)   Similar Use Determination and Unlisted Uses.
      (1)   The Director of Community Development shall make the determination
if a proposed use is permitted, permitted with standards, conditional, or
prohibited under the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   The Director of Community Development may determine that a proposed
use is substantially similar to a use that is permitted, permitted with
standards, conditional, or prohibited as established in Table 1105-1 based on:
         A.   The proposed use activities;
         B.   The character of the proposed use as compared to other uses;
         C.   Similarity to existing uses within the City; and/or
         D.   Information on the use that may be available from third-party or
governmental land use resources such as documentation from the American
Planning Association, Urban Land Institute, the U.S. Census Bureau, or similar
organizations.
      (3)   If the Director of Community Development determines that the
proposed use is substantially similar to a use established in Table 1105-1, the
application shall be processed in the same manner as the similar use.
      (4)   In finding that a proposed use is similar to a use established in
Table 1105-1, the Director of Community Development shall make a note of the
similar use on the application form submitted by the applicant (e.g.,
certificate of zoning approval, site plan review, conditional use, etc.).
      (5)   If the Director of Community Development makes the determination
that a use is not allowed, the application shall be denied. Such decision may
be appealed to the BZA pursuant to Section
1129.13.

regulations, to the extent permitted by law, to apply the standards set forth
in this section to specifically accomplish the following:
         A.   Accommodate the need for cellular or wireless communications
towers and facilities for the provision of personal wireless services while
regulating their location and number in the City;
         B.   Minimize adverse visual effects of communications towers and
support structures through proper siting, design and screening;
         C.   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from communications
towers and support structure failure;
         D.   Encourage the joint use of any new and existing communications
towers and support structures to reduce the number of such structures needed in
the future; and
         E.   Facilitate modifications to existing communication facilities.
      (2)   Exemptions. The following shall be exempt from the provisions of

      (3)   Standards and Processes for New Wireless Communications Towers and
Antenna.
         A.   Standards of Approvals Applicable to All New Cellular or Wireless
Communications Antennas and Towers as Conditional Uses.
            i.   The applicant shall demonstrate that the tower and/or antenna
is the minimum height required to function satisfactorily. No tower or antenna
that is taller than this minimum height shall be approved. In no case shall a
tower exceed 200 feet in height.
            ii.   If a cellular or wireless communications tower is to be
constructed, the minimum distance between the base of the tower or any guy wire
anchors and the property line shall be the greater of the following:
               a)   Forty percent (40%) of the tower height;
               b)   The minimum setback in the underlying zoning district; or
               c)   Fifty (50) feet.
            iii.   The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed cellular
or wireless communications tower and its antennas are safe and that the
surrounding properties will not be negatively affected by tower failure,
falling ice or other debris, electromagnetic fields or radio frequency
interference. Furthermore, all cellular or wireless communications towers shall
be fitted with anti-climbing devices as approved by manufacturers.
            iv.   Cellular or wireless communications sites shall be set back a
minimum of 1,000 feet from any lot in a residential zoning district.
            v.   A fence shall be required around the cellular or wireless
communications tower and its support structure(s), unless the antenna is
mounted on an existing structure. The fence shall be minimum of eight (8) feet
in height and shall be erected to prevent access to non-authorized personnel.
            vi.   Landscaping shall be required to screen, to the greatest
extent possible, the support structures, the fence surrounding the cellular or
wireless communications tower, and any other ground level features and, in
general, shall soften the appearance of the cellular or wireless communications
site. The City may permit any combination of existing vegetation, topography,
walls, decorative fences or other features instead of landscaping, if they
achieve the same degree of screening as the required landscaping. If the
antenna is mounted on an existing structure, and other equipment is housed
inside of an existing structure, landscaping shall not be required. Any
freestanding cellular or wireless communications tower shall incorporate
landscaping which includes trees, shrubs and other landscaping vegetation that
is subject to review and is acceptable to the Planning Commission. In addition.
existing vegetation on and around the site shall be preserved to the greatest
extent possible.
            vii.   In order to reduce the number of antenna support structures
needed in the City in the future, the proposed cellular or wireless
communications tower shall be required to accommodate other uses, including
other cellular or wireless communications companies, personal wireless
services, and the local police, fire, and ambulance departments.
            viii.   The communications company must demonstrate to the City
that it is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
            ix.   If the cellular or wireless communications site is fully
automated, adequate parking shall be required for maintenance workers. If the
site is not fully automated, the number of required parking spaces shall equal
the number of employees working on the largest shift. All parking
specifications and requirements shall be consistent with the applicable parking
requirements as established in this code.
            x.   Cellular or wireless communications towers under 200 feet in
height shall be painted silver or have a galvanized finish retained in order to
reduce visual impact. Cellular or wireless communications towers shall meet all
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. No cellular or wireless
communications towers may be artificially lighted except when required by the
FAA. Furthermore, no cellular or wireless communication tower or antenna shall
contain any signage except safety signage, or signage required by the FAA or
FCC.
            xi.   The cellular or wireless communications company shall be
required to demonstrate, using the latest technological evidence, that the
antenna or tower must be placed where it is proposed in order to satisfy its
necessary function in the company's grid system.
            xii.   If the communications company proposes to build a cellular
or wireless communications tower (as opposed to mounting the antenna on an
existing structure), it shall be required to demonstrate that it has contacted
the owners of nearby tall structures within a one-mile radius of the site
proposed, asked for permission to install the cellular communications antenna
on those structures, and was denied for reasons other than economic ones. "Tall
structures" shall include, but not be limited to: smoke stacks, water towers,
buildings over fifty (50) feet in height, antenna support structures of other
cellular or wireless communication companies, other communication towers and
roadway lighting poles.
            xiii.   The City may deny the application to construct a new
cellular or wireless communications tower if the applicant has not made a good
faith effort to mount the antenna on existing structures.
            xiv.   Applications for new cellular or wireless communications
antennas and towers shall also be reviewed against the applicable review
criteria for conditional uses under Section
1129.04 of this code.
         B.   Process of Approvals Applicable to All New Cellular or Wireless
Communications Antennas and Towers.
            i.   The process for review of applications for all new cellular or
wireless communications antennas and towers as conditional uses shall be as
established in Section
1129.04, as modified in this section.
            ii.   Site Plan Required
               a)   In addition, a full site plan shall be required for all
proposed new cellular or wireless communications sites in accordance with the
submittal requirements established by the Director of Community Development.
See Section
1129.07 for the site plan review process.
               b)   Upon submission of a complete application for site plan
review to the Director of Community Development, the application shall be
transmitted to the Planning Commission which shall review the site plan to
determine if it meets the purpose and requirements as established in this
section, of the zoning district where the proposed cellular or wireless
communications site is located, and of any other applicable section of the
code.
               c)   Notwithstanding the deadlines and timelines established for
the reviews of applications for conditional uses pursuant to Section
1129.04 and for site plans pursuant to Section
1129.07, and subject to current federal "shot clock" rules, applications for
new cellular or wireless communications antennas and towers shall be processed
and acted upon within ninety (90) days for collocation applications and within
150 days for applications other than collocations. These deadlines begin to run
when an application is first submitted, not when the application is deemed
complete. These deadlines can be paused if the Director of Community
Development notifies the applicant within thirty (30) days that the application
is incomplete. The Director of Community Development may pause the application
review timeline again if he/she provides written notice within ten (10) days
that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in
the original notice delineating missing information. Additionally, these review
periods may be tolled by mutual agreement between the City (through the
Director of Community Development) and the applicant. The timeframe for review
is not tolled by a moratorium on the review of applications.
         C.   Necessity to Collocate. Any applicant for a conditional use to
construct a cellular or wireless communication system shall demonstrate to the
City of Sharonville that such user has made all reasonable efforts to collocate
its equipment upon an existing tower owned either by the applicant or by
another entity. Such efforts to collocate shall be documented by clear and
convincing evidence of such attempts, and if such attempts are not feasible,
the lack of feasibility shall also be documented by clear and convincing
evidence that collocation is unfeasible. Collocation shall also be required on
tall structures in the vicinity of that proposed by the applicant. As a
guideline, all owners of tall structures and other cellular and wireless
communications systems within a one-mile radius shall be contacted and
permission requested to install such structure. In addition, any applicant to
construct such a system must indicate its willingness to cooperate in the
future to allow collocation by another user. Refusal to cooperate in
collocation requests by either the applicant for a new structure or the owner
and operator of a current structure shall represent grounds for denial of
future requests by such users. Applicants who request the right to collocate
are expected and required to bear an equitable share of capital operating and
other expenses in connection with such shared use.
      (4)   Standards and Processes for Modifications to Existing Towers and
Base Stations.
         A.   Purpose. This section implements Section 6409(a) of the Middle
Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (47 U.S.C. § 1455), as
interpreted by the Federal Communications Commission's ("FCC") Acceleration of
Broadband Deployment Report & Order (29 FCC Rcd 12865), which requires a state
or local government to approve Eligible Facilities Requests for a modification
of an existing tower or base station that does not result in a substantial
change to the physical dimensions of such tower or base station.
         B.   Application Review Process.
            i.   Application. The City shall prepare and make publicly
available an application form which shall be limited to the information
necessary for the City to consider whether an application is an Eligible
Facilities Request. The application may not require the applicant to
demonstrate a need or business case for the proposed modification.
            ii.   Type of Review. Upon receipt of an application for an
Eligible Facilities Request pursuant to this chapter, the Director of Community
Development shall review such application to determine whether the application
so qualifies.
            iii.   Timeframe for Review. Within sixty (60) days of the date on
which an applicant submits an application seeking approval under this chapter,
the City shall approve the application unless it determines that the
application is not covered by this chapter.
            iv.   Tolling of the Timeframe for Review. The sixty (60)-day
review period begins to run when the application is filed, and may be tolled
only by mutual agreement between the City and the applicant, or by the Director
of Community Development in cases where the Director of Community Development
determines that the application is incomplete. The timeframe for review is not
tolled by a moratorium on the review of applications.
               a)   To toll the timeframe for incompleteness, the City must
provide written notice to the applicant within thirty (30) days of receipt of
the application, specifically delineating all missing documents or information
required in the application.
               b)   The timeframe for review begins running again when the
applicant makes a supplemental submission in response to the City's notice of
incompleteness.
               c)   Following a supplemental submission, the City will notify
the applicant within ten (10) days that the supplemental submission did not
provide the information identified in the original notice delineating missing
information. The timeframe is tolled in the case of second or subsequent
notices pursuant to the procedures identified in this section. Second or
subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or
information that were not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness.
            v.   Interaction with 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7). If the City determines
that the applicant's request is not covered by Section 6409(a) as delineated
under this chapter, the presumptively reasonable timeframe under 47 U.S.C. §
332(c)(7), as prescribed by the FCC's Shot Clock order, will begin to run from
the issuance of City's decision that the application is not a covered request.
To the extent such information is necessary, the City may request additional
information from the applicant to evaluate the application under 47 U.S.C. §
332(c)(7), pursuant to the limitations applicable to other reviews under that
section.
            vi.   Failure to Act. In the event the City fails to approve or
deny a request seeking approval under this chapter within the timeframe for
review (accounting for any tolling), the request shall be deemed granted. The
deemed grant does not become effective until the applicant notifies the
applicable reviewing authority in writing after the review period has expired
(accounting for any tolling) that the application has been deemed granted.
            vii.   Remedies. Applicants and the City may bring claims related
to Section 6409(a) to any court of competent jurisdiction.
      (5)   Maintenance. Any owner of property used as a cellular or wireless
communications site shall maintain such property and all structures in good
condition and free from trash, outdoor storage, weeds and other debris. Any
cellular or wireless communications tower that has discontinued its service for
a period of 180 continuous calendar days or more shall be removed, along with
all accessory structures related thereto. Discontinued shall mean that the
structure has not been properly maintained, has been abandoned, become
obsolete, is unused or has ceased the daily activities or operations which had
occurred.
      (6)   Removal of Abandoned Facilities. Any license renewal requires that
all providers utilizing wireless communications towers present a report to the
City of Sharonville of any tower and accessory facilities/structures located in
the City of Sharonville whose use will be discontinued and the date this use
will cease. If at any time the use of the wireless communications tower and
accessory facilities/structures is discontinued for a continuous period of 180
days, the Director of Community Development may declare the wireless
communications tower and accessory facilities/structures abandoned. The owner/
operator of the wireless communications tower and accessory facilities/
structures will receive written notice from the Director of Community
Development and be instructed to either reactivate use of the wireless
communications tower and accessory facilities/structures within 180 days or
dismantle and remove the wireless communications tower and accessory
facilities/structures.
      (7)   Nonconforming Facilities. Except as provided in this chapter, any
use being made of an existing tower or antenna support structure on the
effective date of this code and any amendment thereto shall be allowed to
continue, even if it is in conflict with this section. Any change or
improvement made to an existing wireless communications tower shall comply with
this section.
      (8)   Technical and Legal Consultants. At its discretion, the City may
engage outside technical and/or legal consultants to evaluate and/or verify the
information used to support application or any testimony in City proceedings.
The reasonable cost for the consultants shall be borne by the applicant. An
advance deposit for the estimated cost of the fees for the outside consultants
shall be promptly paid to the City by the applicant upon request by the City.
Failure to pay such deposit shall render any pending application incomplete
until paid. After the consultant's work has been completed, if the amount of
the deposit was insufficient to cover the cost of the consultants' fees the
applicant shall immediately reimburse the City for any shortfall. If the cost
of the work is less than the estimate the amount over shall promptly be repaid
to the applicant at the conclusion of the application proceedings.
   (i)   Adult Entertainment Establishments.
      (1)   Purpose and Findings.
         A.   It is the purpose of this section to regulate adult entertainment
establishments in order to promote the public health, safety, morals,
convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare of the citizens of the
City, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the
deleterious location and concentration of adult entertainment establishments
within the City. The provisions of this chapter do not have the purpose or
effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Further, it is
not the intent of this section to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually
oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment of their
intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone
or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

CHAPTER 1107
Overlay Zoning Districts
1107.01   Purpose.
1107.02   Reading Road Gateway North Overlay District.
   1107.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the Northern Lights Overlay District (NLO) is
to:
      (1)   To leverage public dollars invested in the expansion of the
Sharonville Convention Center, improvement of the Chester Road corridor, and
investment in the Princeton City School District facilities by encouraging land
uses and site design that complement the Convention Center and corridor as
envisioned in the Comprehensive Plan and the Northern Lights District Master
Plan;
      (2)   To enhance property values, protect property rights, stabilize and
improve the Chester Road corridor, and increase economic and financial benefits
to Sharonville businesses and inhabitants;
      (3)   To encourage innovative and creative site design, outdoor lighting,
and architecture;
      (4)   To promote development that emphasizes safe pedestrian connections
and amenities while accommodating automobile access; and
      (5)   To encourage mixed-use development that creates a vibrant
hospitality, entertainment, and office district that responds to changing
market demands and conditions.
   (b)   Creation and Boundaries. The boundaries of the NLO District are
depicted on the zoning map.
   (c)   Effect of Northern Lights Overlay District Designation.
      (1)   The NLO District regulations apply in combination with underlying
base zoning district regulations and all other applicable standards of this
code. When the NLO District standards conflict with the underlying base zoning
district regulations, or other standards of this code, the regulations of the
NLO District will apply.
      (2)   When the NLO District does not regulate an issue that is regulated
by an underlying base zoning district, the underlying base zoning district
regulations shall apply.
   (d)   Site Plan Review Procedure.
      (1)   All new construction, structure alterations, and site improvements
in the NLO District are subject to the full site plan review procedure in
Section
1129.07.
      (2)   Applicants shall be required to meet with the Director of Community
Development for a pre-application meeting unless such meeting is waived by the
Director of Community Development.
      (3)   The Sharonville Northern Lights Overlay District Standards and
Guidelines (See Section
1107.01(f).) contain both mandatory standards and an elective set of
guidelines. Applications must meet one hundred percent (100%) of the mandatory
standards in order to receive any zoning approval. Applications also must meet
a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the guidelines established for the NLO
District.
   (e)   Permitted Uses. Table 1105-1 establishes what principal uses are
permitted or prohibited in the NLO District by establishing how uses are
permitted in accordance with the underlying base zoning district, permitted
across the entire NLO District, regardless of the underlying base zoning
district, or specifically prohibited in the NLO. See Section
1105.02(b)(4).
   (f)   NLO District Standards and Guidelines. The following are the specific
district standards and guidelines established for the NLO District. As noted
earlier, all standards are mandatory and guidelines are elective, although all
applications must meet fifty percent (50%) of the guidelines. Not all
components of design have guidelines. Additionally, other sections of this code
may be applicable to the NLO District including, but not limited to, Section
1113.02 and Section
1113.06.
      (1)   Architecture.
         A.   Overall Design Intent.
            i.   Building design will create a coordinated, modern
architectural style that distinguishes the NLO District, while reinforcing a
pedestrian scale.
            ii.   A primary objective for architectural design in the NLO
District is to discourage architectural styles historically rooted in pre-
1920's expression and create a distinctly modern district.
            iii.   Recommended building features include, but are not limited
to:
               a)   Streamlined appearance with limited ornamentation (except
as needed to achieve a pedestrian scale);
               b)   Sharp and angular elements with smooth transitions to
faceted and curvilinear geometries;
               c)   Curved and/or rounded corners;
               d)   Sweeping, striated thrusting lines found in horizontal,
vertical and curvilinear motifs;
               e)   Ziggurat (Stepped) parapets at facades;
               f)   "Eyebrow"-shaped fixed cantilevered canopies;
               g)   Bullet shapes;
               h)   The use of lighting from within translucent walls; and
               i)   Surfaces with a glistening, shimmering or crystalline
appearance.
         B.   Building Materials.
            i.   Intent. Building Materials must offer a crystalline, polished
appearance. Rougher textures should be utilized only as accent materials.
Examples of preferred materials include metal panels, perforated metals,
translucent panels, glass block, glass with etched and frosted glazing, and
decorative concrete.
            ii.   Standards.
               a)   The use of vinyl, shingles, or shakes is prohibited.
               b)   E.I.F.S. material is prohibited from being used on the
first floor of any building but may be used for the facades of second or higher
floors.
         C.   Building Facades.
            i.   Intent. Buildings must convey a street presence that is
decidedly modern and pedestrian in scale. The core of the NLO District (between
Greenwood Road and Clinton Avenue) should include a more densely developed
atmosphere with taller buildings than surrounding areas.
            ii.   Standards.
               a)   Buildings located on properties with frontage on Chester
Road, between Clinton Avenue and BAPS Lane, shall be a minimum of sixteen (16)
feet tall.
               b)   Although taller buildings are permissible, the front
portion of the building must be built at a pedestrian scale and impacts on
surrounding residential areas should be minimized. Maximum heights are provided
below for specific locations within the NLO District. Maximum height applies to
the front facade of the building, or for parcels that are adjacent to a
residential district that is outside the NLO District, and for any facade
facing such a residential district.
                  1)   Properties with frontage on Chester Road between Clinton
Avenue and Baps Lane: forty-five (45) feet.
                  2)   All other locations in the NLO District: thirty-five
(35) feet. Taller building sections must be set back by one additional foot per
additional foot of height.

Figure 1107-A: The above is an illustration of the maximum building height
requirement.
               c)   Front facades must incorporate vertical piers or other
vertical elements to break the plane of building facades that exceed a width of
fifty (50) feet. See also Figure 1107-A.
               d)   Front facades must incorporate clear window glass that
permits a full, unobstructed view of the interior to a depth of at least four
(4) feet on at least forty percent (40%) of the building facade area between a
height of two (2) feet and ten (10) feet above grade. This standard applies
only to building facades that have frontage facing Chester Road. The pattern of
window glass must continue on the side facades for a minimum of twenty percent
(20%) of the length of such side facades.

Figure 1107-B: The above is an image provides an example of facade transparency
with the
use of windows and glass doors along the facade that provide for visibility of
at least
four (4) feet into the building.
         D.   Building Placement.
            i.   Intent. The Sharonville NLO District is pedestrian in scale,
yet campus-like in design. Buildings should be placed close to the street to
encourage pedestrian activity, while allowing space for landscaping, pedestrian
plazas and outdoor dining. Building setbacks should vary, creating a meandering
street wall that is visually interesting and consistent with the meandering
nature of the Chester Road streetscape design.
            ii.   Standards.
               a)   Principal building shall be set back a minimum of ten (10)
feet from the planned right-of-way or public roadway easement, whichever depth
is greatest.
               b)   New buildings shall not be set back more than twenty (20)
feet from the planned right-of-way or public roadway easement, whichever depth
is greatest. The maximum front yard setback may be extended by an additional
ten (10) feet for up to thirty percent (30%) of the facade length, as long as
the supplemental front yard is used for outdoor dining, pedestrian walkways, or
a formally landscaped plaza. The maximum front yard setback standard does not
apply to the alteration or enlargement of existing buildings.
               c)   These setbacks shall apply to all street frontages if the
lot has multiple street frontages (i.e., a corner lot or through lot).

Figure 1107-C: The above is an illustration of front yard setback standards in
the NLO District.
               d)   The following shall be the minimum rear and side yard
setbacks for buildings in the NLO District:
                  1)   No side yard setback is required, however, there shall
be a minimum of ten (10)-feet of separation between building facades when side
building facades do not abut one another on adjacent properties.
                  2)   Buildings in the NLO District shall be set back a
minimum of twenty (20) feet from an adjacent residential district that is
located outside the NLO District. The rear or side yard setback must
incorporate screening consistent with Section
1119.06 of this code.
            iii.   Guidelines.
               a)   Buildings should have a variation of front yard setback
from adjacent properties but still remain within the ten (10) to twenty (20)-
foot set back requirement.
               b)   Buildings should include projections and recesses in order
to create variation in the setback within individual buildings.
               c)   Buildings should be oriented so front entrance faces
Chester Road.

Figure 1107-D: The above is an illustration of front entrances oriented toward
the street
(Chester Road).
         E.   Parking.
            i.   Intent. While adequate off-street parking must be provided,
parking lots must not be a dominant visual feature. Parking lots that are
concealed and minimized reinforce an attractive, pedestrian-oriented
environment, reduce stormwater runoff and maximize areas devoted to landscaping
and pedestrian use.
            ii.   Standards.
               a)   Parking lots or stacking spaces located between a building
and the Chester Road right-of-way are prohibited.
               b)   The following shall be the minimum off-street parking
setbacks in the NLO District:
                  1)   Off-street parking areas shall be set back a minimum of
ten (10) feet from any planned right-of-way or public roadway easement,
whichever distance is greatest.
                  2)   Off-street parking areas located on the side of
buildings shall be set back a minimum of ten (10) feet from any adjacent lot
line in a residential district that is located outside the NLO District. The
rear or side yard setback must incorporate screening consistent with Section
1119.06 of this code.
                  3)   No parking setback is required for side and rear yards
within the NLO District that do not abut a right-of-way or public roadway
easement.
               c)   A minimum of thirty percent (30%) of all parking spaces
shall be located to the rear of a building.

               d)   The minimum number of parking spaces shall be provided in
accordance with Chapter
1121: Parking, Access, and Connectivity. The Director of Community Development
may reduce minimum parking requirements if parking is shared as provided for in
this chapter and in Section
1121.04(h).
               e)   Parking lots that are visible from any street right-of-way
shall be screened with a decorative wall or fence or a continuous row of shrubs
with a height no less than three (3) feet and no more than four (4) feet.
Decorative walls and fences must be constructed of masonry, stone, or
ornamental metal. Shrubs must be a minimum of three (3) feet tall at
installation and provide fifty percent (50%) winter opacity within two (2)
years of planting.

Figure 1107-F: The above is an image of the Chester Road streetscape that
illustrates the decorative screening of parking areas from Chester Road.
               f)   Interior landscaping consists of landscaped islands that
are distributed throughout the parking lot to define major circulation routes
and driving lanes and provide visual and climatic relief from broad expanses of
pavement. For parking lots that contain more than twenty (20) parking spaces,
interior landscaping shall cover a minimum of five percent (5%) of the parking
lot.
               g)   Each landscape island must measure at least five (5) feet
in any horizontal direction.
               h)   The parking lot landscaping shall include at least one
shade tree and two (2) shrubs per ten (10) spaces within landscaped islands,
provided there is no impairment to visibility of motorists or pedestrians (See
Section
1113.02.). As an alternative to this standard, landscaped islands as stormwater
infiltration islands, as described in Section
1107.01(f)(1)E.iii.b), may be provided. In providing this alternative, the
applicant shall be in compliance with both the standard and the guideline, as
required in Section
1107.01(d)(3).
               i)   Where a parking lot exceeds the minimum requirements
established in Section
1121.04, the minimum interior landscaping requirement described in Section
1119.05(d) shall be doubled.
               j)   Off-street parking that is enclosed in a multilevel garage
is exempt from Paragraphs c) and e) through i), above. Such garages shall
maintain consistency with the standards and guidelines listed in Chapter
1117: Architectural Standards for parking garages located at building lines
along Chester Road.
            iii.   Guidelines.
               a)   Shared parking represents an arrangement whereby two (2) or
more uses provide their required off-street parking in the same parking lot,
thereby reducing the number of individual parking lots and the number of curb
cuts required to serve such lots. The Planning Commission may reduce the
required off-street parking spaces if the applicant provides an alternative
parking solution (shared, off-site, or land banking) in accordance with Section
1121.04(h).
               b)   Stormwater infiltration islands are planted areas that are
designed to accept stormwater runoff from parking areas, providing temporary
storage and on-site infiltration. Applicants should utilize interior landscaped
islands required in Section
1107.01(f)(1)E.ii as infiltration islands. Additionally, applicants should
utilize areas between parking rows and connect to landscaped islands at the
ends of the row. Below are guidelines for constructing infiltration islands:
                  1)   Incorporate curb cuts or flat curbs along the edges of
the island that allow water to flow into the island;
                  2)   Create a shallow depression of six (6) to eighteen (18)
inches to allow for ponding in the island;
                  3)   Locate ponding areas at least ten (10) feet away from
any building foundations to ensure that the ponded water does not drain to
foundations;
                  4)   Include perennial flowers, ornamental grasses, shrubs
and edges created by attractive walls, pavers or a band of turf, in order to
create an attractive appearance in the island;
                  5)   Include plants that tolerate snow storage and winter
salt and sand; and
                  6)   Plant the tallest flowers and shrubs in the deepest part
of the island.

Figure 1107-G: The above is an image of an infiltration island used in a
parking area.
               c)   Where there is a multi-level parking garage that has a
facade that faces Chester Road, the applicant should incorporate ground-floor
commercial space that is oriented toward Chester Road in parking garages built
at a building line, along Chester Road, as a method of screening the parking
garage.
         F.   Landscape Design.
            i.   Intent. Site design must emphasize landscaping and pedestrian
areas to the same degree as buildings. Pedestrians will walk through an
environment of lush landscaping interspersed with inviting pedestrian gathering
spaces.
            ii.   Standards.
               a)   The front yard, along any street frontage, shall be planted
with live vegetation, shade trees and conifers, except for paved areas
expressly designed for pedestrians or approved driveways. Include one tree per
fifty (50) lineal feet of lot frontage along Chester Road.
               b)   All vegetation installed to comply with these landscaping
standards shall comply with Section
1119.04 on the minimum landscaping requirements. Where fences and walls are
permitted to be a part of and landscaping or screening requirements (Section
1119.06), such wall or fence shall utilize materials and colors that complement
the design of the principal building.
            iii.   Guidelines.
               a)   The applicant may include pedestrian amenities that offer
attractive spaces for customer and visitor interaction and create an inviting
image, as an alternative to landscaped areas. Pedestrian amenities may include
outdoor pedestrian plazas, dining areas, street furniture, water features,
clock towers, public art, or a combination thereof. Pedestrian amenities must
be a minimum of ten (10) square feet in ground coverage and be located in the
front or side yards of parcels adjacent to Chester Road.
               b)   The applicant may plant at least fifty percent (50%) of the
front yard area (not including areas designated for pedestrian use) with
flowers, shrubs, trees, and ground cover other than turf.
               c)   The applicant may incorporate landscape beds and pedestrian
plazas in a curvilinear, meandering fashion, consistent with the Sharonville
Northern Lights design theme. This may include accomplishing the meandering
design element with edges of landscape beds, arrangement of vegetation within
the landscape beds, edges of pedestrian plazas and/or the pavement texture of
pedestrian plazas.

Figure 1107-H: The above images illustrate examples of meeting guidelines for
landscape design.
         G.   Lighting Design.
            i.   Intent. A central element of the Sharonville NLO District is a
multi-layered lighting design that reinforces the Sharonville Northern Lights
images throughout the NLO District. The use of lighting in all architectural
and landscaping elements in the NLO District provides opportunity to immerse
the viewer in the NLO District experience. The ambience of the lighting will
encourage interaction of visitors with the surrounding environment.
            ii.   Standards. Development within the NLO District shall meet the
standards of Section
1113.03.
            iii.   Guidelines.
               a)   Development in the NLO District should incorporate lighting
of landscape elements in order to contribute to the ambience of the NLO
District. Landscape lighting fixture styles shall be consistent with the
lighting designs currently found in the district or compatible with the general
lighting styles found in the district.
               b)   Development in the NLO District should incorporate building
facade lighting that enhances a building's architectural features and creates a
visual effect for pedestrian and distance viewers. Building facade lighting
fixture styles shall be consistent with the lighting designs currently found in
the district or compatible with the general architectural style of the
building.
               c)   Lighting in vehicular use areas within the NLO District
should utilize luminaire and pole assembly styles in parking lots and
pedestrian areas that complement, in appearance, those used for lighting along
Chester Road. Figure 1107-I includes illustrations of permitted luminaire and
pole assembly styles.

in the NLO District.
         H.   Pedestrian Circulation.
            i.   Intent. Site design must provide a safe and attractive
environment for pedestrians. Pedestrian connections must be separated from
automobile traffic. Walkways should be designed to continue the design theme of
the Chester Road streetscape.
            ii.   Standards.
               a)   Plans shall provide pedestrian walkways between the primary
entrances of multiple buildings on a site and buildings, located on adjacent
properties. Such plans shall provide crosswalks where walkways cross driveways
or parking lots.
               b)   Plans shall include a pedestrian walkway from a parking lot
to a building entrance.
               c)   The minimum width of all walkways, sidewalks, or crosswalks
shall be five (5) feet.

Figure 1107-J: Illustration of pedestrian connection examples.
         I.   Vehicular Circulation.
            i.   Intent. The NLO District will provide safe, efficient
vehicular access by reducing vehicular conflicts, minimizing delays, and
reducing congestion. These attributes will sustain the Sharonville Northern
Lights revitalization effort and attract visitors. Accordingly, site design
must incorporate access management standards which include but are not limited
to the following: providing cross access between properties, shared driveways
between properties, right-in/right-out access and full access intersections
located at strategic locations only.
            ii.   Standards.
               a)   The minimum curb cut spacing requirements may be set on a
case-by-case basis by the Director of Community Development in consultation
with the City Engineer, but in no instance shall be less than the distances
listed in Table 1107-1. Distances are measured according to the methods
described in Table 1107-1.
                  1)   For sites with insufficient frontage to meet the
criteria in Table 1107-1, such site shall be permitted one driveway curb cut.
However, the Director of Community Development, in consultation with the City
Engineer, may require construction of a driveway from a side street or a shared
driveway with an adjacent property.

               b)   Lots that have multiple driveway curb cuts that are less
than required in Table 1107-1 shall be required to eliminate at least one curb
cut.
               c)   Corner lots are encouraged to have driveway curb cuts off
of secondary streets.
               d)   Drive-through windows or canopies must be attached to the
principal building and located to the rear of the building.
            iii.   Guidelines.
               a)   For any use or development proposed in the NLO District,
the property owner is encouraged to grant an access easement to all properties
on the same block between intersecting streets. The purpose of the easement is
to facilitate movement of customers and their vehicles from establishment to
establishment (lot to lot) without generating additional turning movements on
Chester Road. The inter-parcel access easement shall be provided subject to the
following provisions:
                  1)   Such inter-parcel access easements shall be submitted to
the City for review and approval before being recorded with the applicable
county recorder office. A reference to deed book and page of such recorded
easement shall be provided to the Director of Community Development.
                  2)   Such inter-parcel access easement agreements shall
include joint maintenance agreements including the responsibilities of the
property owner and benefited parties.
                  3)   The inter-parcel access easement shall grant access
easement rights and permit automobile access from all properties on the same
block between intersecting streets to driveways and service drives intended for
customer or tenant use.
                  4)   The granting of such easement shall be effective upon
the granting of reciprocal easements by the remaining property owners.
                  5)   The location of access easements and underlying
vehicular connections across a property shall be determined by the Director of
Community Development, in conjunction with the City Engineer and applicable
fire/EMS authority and adjoining property owners.

Figure 1107-K: Illustration of inter-parcel access/cross access.
                  6)   Unless already in place, the pavement or other surfacing
of the owner's driveways and/or service drives or parking lots shall be
extended to the property line. The stub drive shall be designed and constructed
to make it visually obvious that the service drive is intended to connect to
adjoining properties and to provide cross access.
                  7)   Service drives and access lanes needed to accommodate
inter-parcel access shall be designed and constructed with:
                     A)   A minimum pavement width of twenty-four (24) feet
measured from edge of pavement to edge of pavement;
                     B)   Pavement geometrics to safely support a ten (10)
miles per hour design speed;
                     C)   Wider pavement widths at curves to accommodate
delivery truck circulation; and
                     D)   An eight (8)-inch asphalt or six (6)-inch concrete
pavement.
         J.   Utility Areas.
            i.   Intent. Utility areas include trash collection areas, grease
disposal receptacles, loading and service bays, transformers, electric and gas
meters, and similar uses. These areas must be screened in order to mitigate
undesirable effects such as noise, odors, and an unattractive appearance.
            ii.   Standards.
               a)   Visible utilities shall be buried or rerouted to an
unobtrusive location. All gas and electric meters, downspouts, and other
appurtenances shall be incorporated into the structure or utilize a similar
color and/or materials to the principal structure.
               b)   Loading areas shall be located to the rear of the building.
Loading areas shall be screened so that they are not visible from adjacent
properties, public thoroughfares, or parking lots, with walls or landscaping to
a minimum height of six (6) feet. Landscaping must reach a minimum height of
six (6) feet and a minimum ninety percent (90%) winter opacity within two (2)
years of planting. When using walls for screening, utilize materials and colors
that complement the design of the building.
         K.   Signs.
            i.   Intent.
               a)   Businesses and uses require identification of some type,
whether it is the name of the establishment or merely the street address. In
constructing signs, businesses and uses must consider the broader impact on the
appearance and image of the Sharonville Northern Lights District. An important
component of the Northern Lights vision is an integrated graphics package that
includes signs in the right-of-way as well as private property.
               b)   The intent of the signage within the district is to promote
the businesses and uses while aesthetically and architecturally supporting the
overall brand and theme character of Sharonville Northern Lights District. The
materials, scale, modularity, lighting and type of sign can be expressive of
the Sharonville Northern Lights theme through a coordinated approach while
showcasing the individual businesses.
            ii.   Standards. All signs within the NLO District shall meet the
standards of Chapter
1123: Signs.
               (Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1107.02 READING ROAD GATEWAY NORTH OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the Reading Road Gateway North Overlay
District is to:
      (1)   To improve the general environment of a major entrance into and a
major thoroughfare within the City of Sharonville, that being the section of
Reading Road between Parcel Number 608-0011-0092-00 (Book 608, Page 11, Parcel
92) and the Butler County Line;
      (2)   To facilitate development within the RRO District by providing
reduced yard and area regulations to accommodate lots that may otherwise be too
small for those uses which are permitted within the Sharonville industrial
zoning categories;
      (3)   To maintain the applicability of the underlying industrial land
uses (CS, GI, and ITC Districts);
      (4)   To provide for the applicability of the underlying yard and area
regulations and any other regulations that are not otherwise regulated by the
provisions of the overlay district; and
      (5)   To promote the most desirable use of land in accordance with the
objectives of the Sharonville Comprehensive Plan.
   (b)   Allowed Uses. The uses allowed in the RRO District shall be those
allowed in the underlying base zoning districts. Such uses shall be allowed in
the same manner as allowed in those underlying base zoning districts. See
Section
1105.02.
   (c)   Minimum Development Regulations for Lots 185 Feet or Less in Depth.
      (1)   All development in the RRO District on lots that are 185 feet or
less in depth as measured from the public right-of-way shall comply with the
following:
         A.   The minimum lot frontage at street right-of-way shall be 100
feet.
         B.   The minimum lot width shall be 100 feet.

or vehicular use areas.
         F.   The minimum lot area shall be 5,000 square feet.
         G.   The maximum lot coverage of all buildings shall be fifty percent
(50%).
         H.   The maximum building height shall be (2) two stories, and in no
case taller than twenty-five (25) feet.
      (2)   See Section
1113.01 for the measurement methods of lot area, lot width, setbacks, lot
coverage, and building height.
   (d)   Applicability of Underlying Zoning. Where the RRO District provisions
are silent on a zoning regulation, then the requirements of the underlying
zoning district shall apply.

CHAPTER 1109
Planned Unit Developments
1109.01   Purpose.
1109.02   Scope and liability.
1109.03   PUD review process.
1109.04   Review criteria.
1109.05   Permitted uses.
1109.06   Development standards.
   1109.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is to provide a
means for encouraging ingenuity, imagination and flexibility in the planning
and designing of medium and large-scale developments where traditional base
zoning districts may be too restrictive for the range of proposed uses or
design. The PUD regulations provide a controlled flexibility by utilizing
objectives and performance standards rather than rigid design requirements, the
intent being to encourage developments that possess greater amenities and/or
provide greater environmental protection than standard zoning district
requirements. It is not the intent of the PUD to allow applications to
circumvent the intent of this code or to permit residential density, uses,
housing types, or street and utility layouts which conflict with the
Comprehensive Plan, other adopted plans and policies, or the character of the
area. It is furthermore the purpose of the PUD regulations to:
   (a)   To provide more desirable living, shopping, and working environments
by helping to achieve the goals of the Comprehensive Plan in a manner that
allows for the comprehensive review of a medium to large-scale development;
   (b)   To encourage creative and high-quality developments that are
compatible with surrounding land uses, achieve a high degree of pedestrian-
vehicular separation, and contribute to the overall quality of Sharonville;
   (c)   To provide for a flexible arrangement of buildings, densities and a
variety of housing types to meet the needs of the residential market;
   (d)   To encourage the creation of open space and the development of
recreational facilities and neighborhood commercial facilities in a generally
central location within reasonable distance of any residential components of
the development;
   (e)   To promote a harmonious design amongst the various elements and uses
within the development while mitigating any potential negative impact on
surrounding properties;
   (f)   To allow phased construction with the knowledge that subsequent phases
shall be approved as originally planned and approved by the City;
   (g)   To ensure that there are adequate services and infrastructure to serve
the proposed development; and
   (h)   To reserve adequate land areas for schools, parks and other public
uses.
      (Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1109.02 SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   The intent of the PUD regulations is to provide a means for applying
comprehensive and flexible planning and design techniques on properties
substantially sized to accommodate such a plan. As such, the minimum size of
any PUD project or plan shall be five acres. PUD proposals should not be
applied to small areas as a means of bypassing traditional district
regulations.
   (b)   A PUD of less than five acres may be considered for medium or high-
density residential areas as defined by the Comprehensive Land Use Plan. The
Planning Commission and City Council must approve such reduction in size.
   (c)   Any PUD approved and constructed prior to the effective date of this
amendment shall carry forward with the approved plans. All future construction
or changes in previously approved PUDs shall comply with the applicable
approved plan unless a modification is required, in which case, the
modification shall be reviewed in accordance with this chapter.
(Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1109.03 PUD REVIEW PROCESS.
   (a)   Ownership. In order to submit an application for PUD review, the tract
or tracts of land included within the proposed PUD shall be in one ownership or
control, or shall be subject to a joint application by the owners of all
properties included within the proposal.
   (b)   PUD Submission and Review Procedure.
      (1)   Step 1 - Pre-Application Meeting (Required). An applicant shall be
required to have a pre-application meeting with the Director of Community
Development, and additional staff, to informally discuss the application and
any concept plans. Such meeting shall be subject to Section 1129.02(f).
      (2)   Step 2 - Application. The applicant shall submit an application in
accordance with Section
1129.02 and the provisions of this section.
      (3)   Step 3 - Preliminary Development Plan and Zoning Map Amendment.
         A.   The PUD Preliminary Development Plan approval procedure involves
a zoning map amendment to rezone the subject property to a PUD with an approved
PUD Preliminary Development Plan.
         B.   The procedure for this stage shall comply with the requirements
of Section
1129.03.
         C.   In accordance with the zoning map amendment review procedure, the
Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing to review the PUD Preliminary
Development Plan and make a recommendation to City Council to approve, approve
with modifications, or deny the application. The recommendation shall be made
based on review of the application using the criteria contained in Section
1109.04. The Planning Commission may, in its recommendation to City Council,
require that the PUD Final Development Plan be submitted in stages upon
evidence assuring completion of the entire development in accordance with the
PUD Preliminary Development Plan and phased development schedule.
         D.   In accordance with the zoning map amendment review procedure,
City Council shall hold a public hearing on the PUD Preliminary Development
Plan and PUD zoning map amendment and decide to approve, approve with
modifications, or deny the recommendation of the Planning Commission using the
criteria contained in Section
1109.04, of this chapter.
            i.   If City Council moves to adopt the recommendation of Planning
Commission, such action shall only require concurring vote of four members of
City Council.
            ii.   If City Council moves to adopt the recommendation of Planning
Commission with modification, or deny the recommendation, such action shall
require a favorable vote of six members of City Council.
         E.   In making its recommendations or decisions, the Planning
Commission and/or City Council may impose such conditions of approval as are in
its judgment necessary to insure conformity to the applicable criteria and
standards of this zoning code and to the Comprehensive Plan. In so doing, the
Planning Commission and/or City Council may permit the applicant to revise the
plan and resubmit it as a PUD Preliminary Development Plan within sixty (60)
days of such action.
      (4)   Step 4 - PUD Final Development Plan Review.
         A.   Within one year after the approval of the PUD Preliminary
Development Plan, the applicant shall file a PUD Final Development Plan for the
entire development, or when submitting in stages, as authorized by the Planning
Commission during the PUD Preliminary Development Plan review, for the first
phase of the development.
         B.   If more than one year passes from the date of approval of the PUD
Preliminary Development Plan and the PUD Final Development Plan has not been
submitted for approval, or a request for an extension not to exceed one year
has been filed with the Planning Commission, then the PUD Preliminary
Development Plan shall be deemed expired and the applicant must resubmit such
plan.
         C.   In no case shall a PUD Preliminary Development Plan be valid for
more than two years, including an approved extension.
         D.   After the PUD Preliminary Development Plan has expired, the PUD
zoning designation shall remain in place, but no development shall be
authorized unless the property owner, or authorized agent, submits a new PUD
Preliminary Development Plan for review pursuant to this chapter, or submits an
application for a zoning map amendment to another zoning district.
         E.   Once an applicant submits a PUD Final Development Plan for
review, upon determination by the Director of Community Development that the
PUD Final Development Plan submissions are complete, such plans shall be
submitted to the Planning Commission for review at its next regularly scheduled
meeting, or at a special meeting. The Planning Commission will review the PUD
Final Development Plan to determine whether it conforms in all substantial
respects to the previously approved PUD Preliminary Development Plan and to all
other applicable standards of this code.
         F.   Preliminary subdivision plat approval may occur concurrently with
the PUD Final Development Plan approval if permitted by the Director of
Community Development. If submitting plats for subdivision review
simultaneously with the PUD Final Development Plan, the plats shall be subject
to all applicable subdivision standards and requirements including the
applicable review process.
         G.   The Planning Commission shall hold a public meeting on the PUD
Final Development Plan and decide to approve, approve with modifications, or
deny the application using the criteria contained in Section
1109.04 of this chapter.
         H.   In its decision, the Planning Commission may impose such
conditions of approval as are in its judgment necessary to insure conformity to
the applicable criteria and standards of this code and with the Comprehensive
Plan. In so doing, the Planning Commission may permit the applicant to revise
the plan and resubmit it as a PUD Final Development Plan within sixty (60) days
of such action. Such conditions shall be made a part of the terms under which
the development is approved. Any violation of such conditions shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter and no certificate of zoning approval will be issued.
      (5)   Step 5 - Certificate of Zoning Approval Issuance. Certificates of
zoning approval shall not be issued until the lot or applicable subdivision has
been fully recorded in the office of the Hamilton or Butler County Recorder's
Office, as applicable, and public improvements have been installed in
accordance with the applicable subdivision regulations.
   (c)   Time Limit.
      (1)   Any PUD Final Development Plan shall be valid for a period of two
(2) years after the date of approval by the Planning Commission. If no
development has begun (development being defined as the start of construction
of the required public/private improvements as shown on the approved PUD Final
Development Plan for one or more phases of the project) within two years from
the date of approval, such approval shall lapse and be of no force and effect.
      (2)   Two (2) one-year extensions of the time limit set forth in section
1109.03(c)(1), above, may be granted by the Planning Commission if such
extension is not in conflict with the most current comprehensive land use plan
and if such extension is in the best interests of the entire community. The
developer/owner shall apply for an extension and shall state the reason for the
extension.
      (3)   If an approved PUD Final Development Plan lapses as provided in
this section, the originally approved PUD Preliminary Development Plan shall
also be considered void. Notice of such lapse shall be filed by the Planning
Commission and forwarded to the City Council.
      (4)   Voiding of the PUD preliminary and Final Development Plans shall
not rezone the property. After such plans are voided, the Planning Commission,
City Council, or property owners may initiate a rezoning to a base zoning
district in accordance with Section
1129.03, or the property owner, or their agent, may resubmit a PUD Preliminary
Development Plan in accordance with the procedures of this chapter.
   (d)   Changes to Approved PUDs.
      (1)   A PUD shall be constructed and completed in accordance with the
approved PUD Final Development Plan including all supporting data and
conditions. The PUD Final Development Plan and supporting data, together with
all recorded amendments, shall be binding on the applicants, their successors,
grantees and assignees, and shall limit and control the use of premises
(including the internal use of buildings and structures) and the location of
structures in the PUD as set forth therein.
      (2)   Where a property owner on a lot in a PUD seeks a variance from the
applicable standards for an individual property that will not apply to any
other property in the PUD, the property owner shall request such variance in
accordance with Section
1129.11.
      (3)   Any request to change or otherwise modify the approved PUD Final
Development Plan as it applies to more than one property owner, shall be
reviewed based on whether the change is considered major or minor, in
accordance with this subsection.
         A.   Major Change.
            i.   Major changes to a PUD require the prior approval of the
Planning Commission and the City Council in the same process, and with the same
hearings, as was used to review of the PUD Preliminary Development Plan. The
Director of Community Development shall have the authority to determine if a
proposed change is a major change. Major changes include, but are not limited
to:
               a)   Expansion of the PUD project beyond the original tract
coverage;
               b)   Removal or subtraction of land from the original tract
coverage; and
               c)   Proposed changes that will result in an increase in
residential dwelling units of more than five percent (5%) of the total dwelling
units proposed or an aggregate increase of more than ten percent (10%) in
nonresidential square footage.
            ii.   Changes that require the approval of only the Planning
Commission at a public hearing include, but are not limited to, the following:
               a)   Changes in the site plan relative to the size and
arrangement of buildings, the layout of streets or circulation patterns, the
size, configuration and location of common open space, and changes in any
approved elements of the PUD; and
               b)   Amendments to the conditions that were attached to the PUD
Preliminary Development Plan or PUD Final Development Plan approval.
         B.   Minor Changes.
            i.   Minor changes are those proposed by the developer/owner which
do not disturb or affect the basic design and approved PUD Preliminary
Development Plan, and which are essentially technical in nature, as determined
by the Director of Community Development.
            ii.   Examples of minor changes include, but are not limited to,
changes in the intensity of lighting, changes in the size or location of water
and sewer lines within approved easements, and changes in the location or
number of fire hydrants.
            iii.   Additionally, the Director of Community Development shall
have the authority to approve structural dimensional changes that do not
increase density, that do not change building height by more than ten (10)
feet, or that do not change building or perimeter setbacks by more than fifteen
(15) feet when necessary to accommodate minor shifts in the location of
improvements or infrastructure.
            iv.   The Director of Community Development shall notify the
Planning Commission of all such approved minor changes.
   (e)   Revocation.
      (1)   In the event of a failure to comply with the approved plan or any
prescribed condition of approval, including failure to comply with the stage
development schedule, the Planning Commission may, after notice and hearing,
revoke the approval of the PUD Preliminary Development Plan or Final
Development Plan. The Planning Commission shall at the same time recommend
whether to maintain the PUD zoning district or to rezone the properties to
another zoning district.
      (2)   The revocation shall become final thirty (30) days after City
Council passes an ordinance to rezone the property to a base zoning district,
other than a PUD, or a decision by the Planning Commission to revoke the
approved plans but retain the PUD zoning.
      (3)   Where the PUD zoning remains without an approved PUD Preliminary
Development Plan or a PUD Final Development Plan, the property owner or agent
shall be required to submit a new PUD Preliminary Development Plan in
accordance with the review procedures of this chapter.
   (f)   Recording. The recording of the subdivision related to the PUD
approval shall be done in the same manner as outlined in Section
1129.06.

single-family and two-family dwellings shall not be less than fifteen (15) feet
or one-half the height of the higher structure, whichever is greater.
         D.   For multi-family dwellings, principal buildings should be
oriented in a manner that will provide the most privacy to individual dwellings
through creative placement, building orientation, and increased separation.
   
   (b)   Design and Development Standards. Where this code provides for design
and development standards (e.g., parking, landscaping, architectural standards,
etc.) not specifically addressed in this chapter, development within a PUD
shall comply with the applicable standard found elsewhere in the code.
      (1)   Illumination. All development shall comply with the outdoor
lighting standards of Section
1113.03 unless the Planning Commission and City Council allows for modification
of the standards.
      (2)   Off-Street Parking and Loading. All development shall comply with
the requirements of Chapter
1121: Parking, Access, and Connectivity unless otherwise approved by the

      (4)   Common Open Space.
         A.   Common open space shall be required in all applications where
there is a proposed PUD that contains any residential uses.
         B.   The common open space requirements for a PUD shall be based on
the proposed residential density and shall be in accordance with Table 1109-1.
         C.   In the case of phased developments, open space shall be provided
in proportion with each developed phase.
 
TABLE 1109-1: PUD COMMON OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS
Proposed Residential Density (Gross Density) Common Open Space Requirements
Under 4 Dwelling Units per Acre              10 Percent
4 to 8 Dwelling Units per Acre               15 Percent
Over 8 Dwelling Units per Acre               20 Percent
         D.   The percentage of open space shall be based on the gross site
area of the proposed project, including all rights-of-way.
         E.   When open space is required, such space should be designed in a
manner that is beneficial to the entire development and is not solely land that
is not developable or that appears to be an extension of proposed lots. Such
design shall be as approved by the Planning Commission and City Council during
the PUD Preliminary Development Plan review.
         F.   Retention or naturalized stormwater management areas that are
designed to be an amenity (e.g., improved ponds, decorative features, etc.),
may be considered as open space if approved by the Planning Commission and City
Council during the PUD Preliminary Plan review.
         G.   The following areas shall not be counted toward compliance with
open space requirements:
            i.   Private and public roads, and associated rights-of-way;
            ii.   Public or private parking spaces, access ways, and driveways
related to any residential use;
            iii.   Required minimum spacing between buildings and required yard
setbacks;
            iv.   Vehicular use areas;
            v.   Land that is subject to pre-existing conservation easements or

pursuant to Section
1109.06(b)(4)F, above.
            viii.   Substations and public utility easements;
            ix.   Leftover land that has no value for development and is not a
natural resource (e.g., river or stream corridor, large forest stand, wetland)
that contributes to the quality of the overall project, as determined by the
Planning Commission, the City Council or the Director of Community Development,
as may be applicable based on the review procedure.
         H.   All common open space shall be designed in accordance with the
following:
            i.   The location, shape, size and character of common open space
shall be suitable for the proposed residential uses in relation to the
location, number and types of dwelling units it is intended to serve. In any
case, it shall be highly accessible to all residents or users of the PUD.
            ii.   The common open space shall be used for amenity and/or
recreational purposes. Any uses and/or buildings authorized for the common open
space must be appropriate to the scale and character of the PUD in relation to
its size, density, expected population, topography and the type of dwellings.
            iii.   The common open space shall be suitably improved for its
intended use, but common open space containing natural features worthy of
preservation may be left unimproved. The buildings, structures and improvements
which are permitted in the common open space shall be appropriate to the uses
which are authorized for the common open space and shall conserve and enhance
the amenities of the common open space regarding its topography and unimproved
condition.
            iv.   Where appropriate, open space should be arranged in order to
provide connections to existing or future open space areas, trails, or similar
features on adjoining parcels.
      (5)   Protection and Maintenance of Common Open Space. Adequate provision
shall be made for the long-term maintenance and/or operation of all common open
space in accordance with this section.
         A.   Reclamation of Disturbed Open Space. Any required land areas
designated for use as open space that are disturbed during construction or
otherwise not preserved in their natural state, shall be landscaped with non-
invasive vegetation that appeared in those respective areas prior to
construction or with other native vegetation. The planting of invasive plant
species is prohibited.
         B.   Future Subdivision and Development of Open Space. All required
open space shall be restricted from further subdivision or development by deed
restriction, conservation easement, or other agreement in a form acceptable to
the City of Sharonville and duly recorded in the office of the Hamilton or
Butler County Recorder, as applicable. Subject to permanent restrictions as set
forth above, required open space in an open space residential subdivision shall
be owned by a homeowners' association, a land trust or other conservation
organization, or by a similar entity recognized by the City of Sharonville.
Required open space may be held by the individual members of a homeowners'
association as tenants-in-common or may be held in common ownership by a
homeowners' association, community association, or other similar legal entity.
         C.   Conservation Easements. With the permission of the City of
Sharonville, the owner(s) of required open space may, in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the ORC, grant or transfer a conservation easement to
any entity described in the ORC, provided that the entity and the provisions of
the conservation easements are acceptable to the City of Sharonville. When a
conservation easement is proposed as the method of restricting further
subdivision of land designated as open space, the City of Sharonville shall be
named as a party to such conservation easement with approval authority over any
changes thereto. The conveyance must contain appropriate provision for
assignment of the conservation easement to another entity authorized to hold
conservation easements under the ORC, in the event that the original grantee
becomes unwilling or unable to ensure compliance with the provisions of the
conservation easement.
         D.   Homeowners' Associations. The following shall apply where a
homeowners' association will be established to maintain any open space or other
common areas as required by this article:
            i.   A homeowners' association shall be established to permanently
maintain all open space, common areas and conservation easements related to the
open space unless such open space is preserved in another manner allowed by
this chapter.
            ii.   All homeowners' association agreements shall be submitted for
approval as part of a zoning certificate, conditional use, planned unit
development application, as applicable. Copies of the proposed covenants,
articles of incorporation, and bylaws of the association shall be submitted
with said agreements. No set of proposed covenants, articles of incorporation,
or bylaws of a homeowners' association shall permit the abrogation of any
duties set forth in this section.
            iii.   All homeowners' associations shall guarantee maintenance of
all open space and common areas within the boundaries of the development. In
the event of a failure to maintain such open space or common areas, the City
may do any of the following:
               a)   If the open space or common area is owned by the City, a
City-approved land trust or other qualified organization, county, state or park
district, the City may remedy the failure to maintain at its own cost and seek
reimbursement from the homeowners' association, or seek to enforce the
homeowners' association's duty to maintain through an injunction or any other
civil remedy.
               b)   If the open space or common area exists pursuant to a
conservation easement to which the City is a party, the City may seek to
enforce the terms of the conservation easement as provided in Section
1109.06(b)(5)C.
            iv.   If the open space or common area is owned jointly or in
common by the owners of the building lots, or by any other owner of the
property to be maintained, the City may seek to enforce the association's
nonperformance of its obligations and duties through an injunction or any other
civil remedy.
      (6)   Signs.
         A.   Signs shall be integrated into the building and landscaping plans
to enhance the overall appearance while providing adequate identification of
the development.
         B.   The requirements of Chapter
1123: Signs, may only be waived as part of the approval of the preliminary PUD
plan when the applicant submits a master sign plan for the entire PUD. In such
cases, the master sign plan shall not allow for more than a ten percent (10%)
increase in the total sign area allowed in Chapter
1123: Signs.
      (7)   Development Layout. Dwelling units shall be grouped or clustered to
provide interest and diversity in the arrangement, maximize privacy, collect
and maximize the common open space and promote the individual character and
coordinated layout of each lot, cluster and grouping. Streets and cul-de-sacs
shall be laid out so as to discourage through and high-speed traffic unless
such through street is needed to be in compliance with the approved City plans.
      (8)   Vehicular Access Points.
         A.   Adequate and properly arranged facilities for internal pedestrian
and traffic circulations shall be provided.
         B.   Topography, landscaping and existing vegetative clusters shall be
utilized as necessary to make the project attractive and provide screening
between areas of substantially different character.
         C.   The street and thoroughfare network shall be designed to minimize
truck and through traffic passing through residential areas of the development.
         D.   A minimum of two ingress and egress points shall be provided for
any PUD. If a PUD is phased, each phase shall have a minimum of two ingress and
egress points at the time of construction.
         E.   Where a PUD is located adjacent to a vacant lot, connections
shall be planned for the future connection to the future development of the
vacant lot unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission and City
Council. Where such connections are made, a temporary turnaround may be
established and the future connection shall be noted on the PUD Final
Development Plan and the final subdivision plat. An easement shall be provided
on the final plat of the subdivision to keep the land open in perpetuity for
the connection.
      (9)   Circulation Plan.
         A.   The circulation system and parking facilities shall be designed
to fully accommodate the automobile with safety and efficiency. Any driveway to
arterial and collector streets shall be placed at locations where the traffic
can be controlled and operated effectively with the minimum interference with
the capacity and flow of the existing streets.
         B.   An interconnecting walkway system shall be designed to promote
easy and direct barrier-free access, using accepted criteria, to all areas of
the development in a carefully conceived total service plan while also
considering the security of the residents in the design. Wherever possible, the
vehicular and pedestrian circulation patterns shall be completely separate and
independent of one another.
         C.   A PUD shall consider bicycle plans adopted by the City and/or a
regional agency, where applicable, on or adjacent to the site. A component of
the bike plan which is proposed within a planned unit development shall be
assured for public access by easements, agreements or covenants as may be
appropriate after review by appropriate departments and approval by Council.
   (c)   Improvement Standards.
      (1)   Subdivision Compliance. Unless alternative standards are approved
as part of a subdivision modification, all PUDs shall comply with the
applicable subdivision improvement and design standards established in Chapter
1125: Subdivision Design.
      (2)   Streets. All streets proposed within a PUD shall be public streets,
dedicated to the City of Sharonville in accordance with the applicable
subdivision regulations, unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission
and City Council as part of the PUD Preliminary Development Plan approval.

      (2)   Accessory uses and structures shall be constructed on the same lot
as the principal use that it serves.
      (3)   No accessory structure shall be constructed on any lot until the
construction of the principal structure has commenced.

accessory structure shall be allowed to remain on the lot or property without
the principal building to which it is supposed to be an accessory on the
following conditions:
         A.   Up to twelve (12) months consistent with that allowed by Chapter
1131: Nonconformities.
         B.   A certificate of zoning approval and building permit is obtained
for the reconstruction of the principal structure, the construction of which
shall take place within twelve (12) months. Failure to complete reconstruction
of the principal structure will be an automatic cause for the removal of the
accessory structure at the owner's expense unless cause is given, in which case
the Director of Community Development may approve an extension of up to twelve
(12) months.
      (5)   Small accessory structures such as doghouses, mailboxes, lending
libraries, benches, garden decorations, barbeque equipment, etc. that are not
otherwise addressed in this chapter, shall be exempt from the provisions of

      (7)   An accessory building that is attached to the principal building
shall be considered an integral part of the principal building and shall comply
with the site development standards and all other development standards of the
applicable zoning district. Any accessory structure shall be considered as an
integral part of the principal building if it is connected to the principal
building either by common walls or by a breezeway or roof.
      (8)   The accessory use regulations of this chapter shall not apply to
any public park lands owned by the City, Butler or Hamilton Counties, or the
State of Ohio.
   (c)   Height, Setback, and Size Requirements.

         A.   The maximum height of any detached accessory structure shall be
fourteen (14) feet, measured to the peak, unless otherwise provided for in this
code.

less than ten (10) feet, the accessory structure shall be protected with a
fire-resistant material and shall conform to the same yard requirements as the
principal building. Detached accessory structures that are less than 200 square
feet in floor area shall be set back a minimum of five (5) feet from the
principal building.
         C.   Detached accessory buildings and structures shall be set back a
minimum of twenty (20) feet from the street right-of-way line and a minimum of
five (5) feet from any side or rear lot line, except where the rear lot line is
coterminous with an alley, in which case, the setback may be reduced to one
foot.
         D.   No detached accessory building shall exceed 600 square feet in
floor area.
      (2)   Nonresidential Zoning Districts.
         A.   The maximum height of accessory buildings and structure shall not
exceed the height of the principal building.
         B.   The maximum floor area of a detached accessory building or
structure shall not exceed that of the floor area of the principal building.
      (3)   The floor area of all detached accessory buildings shall count
toward the maximum lot coverage as established in Section
1113.01(g).
   (d)   Prohibited Structures for Accessory Uses.
      (1)   Unless approved as a temporary use pursuant to this code, accessory
structures that are constructed with fabric, canvas, tarpaulin, or other
similar materials shall be prohibited. Inflatable garages or storage structures
shall also be prohibited
      (2)   Portable containers, shipping containers, and semi-tractor trailers
used for storage (with or without wheels) shall not be used as permanent
accessory structures in any residential or the OB, LB, GB, CBD, or SM-D zoning
districts. Temporary storage in portable storage units is permitted in
accordance with Section
1111.02(c)(7).
   (e)   Accessory Uses in the Planned Unit Developments.
      (1)   The types of accessory uses allowed in a PUD shall be considered as
part of the PUD review. Generally:
         A.   Accessory uses for single-family residential dwellings shall be
those allowed in the R1-A District.
         B.   Accessory uses for multi-family residential dwellings shall be
those allowed in the R-M District.
         C.   Accessory uses for nonresidential uses shall be those allowed in
the GB District.
      (2)   The Planning Commission and City Council may approve alternative
accessory uses and structures within a PUD if allowed as part of the PUD
preliminary development plan approval process.
   (f)   Permitted Accessory Uses. The following is an explanation of Table
1111-1.
      (1)   The symbols for permitted uses (P), permitted uses with standards
(PS), conditional uses (C), and prohibited (XX) are defined in the same manner
as Section
1105.02(b).
      (2)   A blank cell indicates that a use is prohibited in the respective
zoning district.
      (3)   Accessory uses in the Northern Lights Overlay District shall be
controlled by the underlying zoning district.
      (4)   Yards Permitted. This column identifies within which yards the use
may be permitted. See the use-specific standards for any restrictions related
to placement in individual yards.
      (5)   Lot Coverage Calculation. This column identifies when the accessory
structure is "included" in the calculation of maximum lot coverage requirements
in Section
1113.01(g).
      (6)   Certificate of Zoning Approval Required. A "Yes" in the
"Certificate of Zoning Approval Required" column shall mean that the applicable
accessory structure or use requires a certificate of zoning approval in order
to be constructed.
      (7)   Use-Specific Standards. The numbers contained in the "Use-Specific
Standards" column are references to additional standards and requirements that
apply to the listed accessory use or structure. Standards referenced in the
"Use-Specific Standards" column apply in all zoning districts unless otherwise
expressly stated.
      (8)   Similar Use Determination and Unlisted Uses. The determination of
whether a proposed accessory use or structure is permitted, permitted with
standards, a conditional use, or a prohibited use under the provisions of this
section shall be made in the same manner as principal uses. See Section
1105.02(d).

   (g)   Standards for Specific Accessory Uses and Structures. The following
requirements apply to the specific types of accessory uses and structures
listed, in addition to the requirements of Section
1111.01(b).
      (1)   Accessibility Ramps.
         A.   Ramps that provide access to buildings for the disabled are
permitted in all zoning districts and may encroach in all setbacks but shall
not encroach on a public sidewalk, right-of-way, or street.
         B.   Such ramps shall be an open structure, without a roof.
      (2)   Agricultural Uses. The raising of fruits, vegetables, and nursery
stock for private use, including cultivated plots, tracts of land, or raised
beds containing single variety or multiple varieties of vegetables, fruits,
berries, or any other edible or otherwise consumable agricultural product or
produce, provided that such areas shall be permitted in accordance with the
following:
         A.   Such uses may take place in the rear yard or any side yard,
without any limitation on setback or total area of land occupied by
agricultural uses.
         B.   Such uses may be located in a front yard provided that square
footage of all agricultural areas in the front yard does not exceed 100 square
feet and shall not encroach into the front yard any more than ten (10) feet
from the front building line.
      (3)   Amateur Radio Towers and Antenna.
         A.   No more than one amateur radio tower and/or antenna shall be
permitted on each lot.
         B.   Ground-mounted amateur radio towers, antennas, and related guy
wire anchors must be located in the rear yard.
         C.   Building-mounted amateur radio towers and antennas must be
located to the rear of the centerline of the principal building.
         D.   Such tower shall not exceed sixty -five (65) feet in height or
the maximum height of the applicable zoning district, whichever is greater. The
measurement shall be made from the grade directly beneath the tower to the
highest point on the antenna or tower, whichever is the tallest point of the
structure.
         E.   Antennas and guy wire anchors shall not overhang or otherwise be
located within required accessory structure setbacks or on adjacent lots.
         F.   When an amateur radio tower and antenna is no longer being used

antenna must be removed no more than 180 days after cessation of the FCC
license or the transfer or property ownership or lease to an individual without
an FCC license.
         G.   Amateur radio towers and antennas that do not comply with the
provisions of this section shall require a conditional use approval (See
Section
1129.04.). The application for a conditional use approval for amateur radio
towers and antennas must demonstrate that compliance with the provisions of
this section would prevent the amateur radio operator from exercising the
rights granted to them by the FCC or the State of Ohio by license or law. If
the Planning Commission determines that expertise beyond that of City staff is
necessary to determine compliance with this criterion, then the applicant shall
reimburse the City for any expenses necessary for hiring a third-party
consultant to make this determination.
      (4)   Community Gardens.
         A.   Community gardens may be allowed as an accessory use when
associated with a public or institutional principal use (e.g., religious

pesticides, and fertilizer will not drain onto adjacent properties.
         F.   There shall be no retail sales on site, except for produce grown
on the site.
         G.   Benches, bike racks, raised/accessible planting beds, picnic
tables, seasonal farm stands, garden art, and rain barrel systems may be
permitted if the community garden is located on a lot where the principal use

garages and carports, detached storage or utility sheds, gazebos, pergolas,
pool houses, and other similar buildings, as determined by the Director of
Community Development.
         B.   Detached garages and carports shall be served by a paved driveway
extending completely from the detached garage or carport to the street.
         C.   Detached accessory buildings shall include accessory structures
that are enclosed, regardless of the materials used for enclosure including,

buildings and subject to these requirements.
      (6)   Drive-Through Facilities and Pick-Up Windows.
         A.   The following standards shall apply to businesses that contain a
drive-through facility regardless if the drive-through is part of another use

(e.g., automatic teller machine).
            i.   Drive-through facilities may only be permitted if approved as
a conditional use by the Planning Commission.
            ii.   Audible electronic devices such as loudspeakers, automobile
service order devices, and similar instruments shall not be located within 100
feet of any residential dwelling unit.
            iii.   All drive-through areas, including but not limited to drive-
through signs, waiting lanes, trash receptacles, audio equipment, drive up
windows, and other objects associated with the drive-through area shall be
located in the side or rear yard of a property to the maximum extent feasible,
and shall not cross, interfere with, or impede any public right-of-way.
            iv.   If the drive-through window, drive-through signage, or any
audio equipment are located in the front yard, they shall be screened with an
opaque, landscaped screen of with a height that will fully screen the window,
signage, or audio equipment. Such screening shall not be required for stacking
spaces that are located in a front yard.
            v.   Drive-through facilities shall be required to include vehicle
stacking spaces as established in Section
1121.07.
         B.   The following standards shall apply to pick-up windows where
there is no vehicular access to the window.
            i.   Pick-up windows are a permitted accessory use in connection
with any restaurant, microbrewery, microdistillery, or microwinery. Such use
will require a certificate of zoning approval.
            ii.   Pick-up windows, and other objects associated with the pick-
up window, shall be located in the side or rear yard of a property to the
maximum extent feasible, and shall not cross, interfere with, or impede any

considered in the CBD when accessory to a restaurant, financial institution, or
other use where the majority of services are provided to customers indoors
(e.g., no stand-alone ATMs, coffee kiosks with no seating, etc.).
      (7)   Food Trucks. Food trucks are permitted in the OB, LB, GB, CS, GI,
and ITC Districts as an accessory use in accordance with the following:
         A.   A maximum of one food truck is permitted to routinely park on the
same lot as the use it will serve or is associated with, at any one time.
         B.   A certificate of zoning approval shall be required in order to
demonstrate the location of the food truck and compliance with these standards.
The certificate of zoning approval shall apply to the property and is not
intended to limit the use of only one food truck operator/provider to the lot
(i.e., different food trucks may rotate operation on the lot provided all the
food trucks comply with the certificate of zoning approval conditions.).
         C.   Such certificate of zoning approval application shall include a
statement from the property owner indicating agreement to the location of the
food truck on such lot.
         D.   Food trucks shall only be permitted on private property and shall
be parked and operate in an off-street, paved parking space.

         I.   Food trucks that are in operation as part of an event or on a
temporary basis shall be subject to the temporary use regulations.
      (8)   Home Occupations. The following standards for home occupations are
intended to provide reasonable opportunities for employment within the home,
while avoiding changes to the residential character of a dwelling that
accommodates a home occupation, or the surrounding neighborhood, where allowed
by this section.
         A.   General Standards.
            i.   The home occupation shall be clearly secondary to the full-
time use of the property as a residence.
            ii.   Permitted home occupations shall not create an adverse effect
on the residential character of the zoning district or interfere with the

not be altered in any manner that is intended to change the residential
appearance of the dwelling to a building with a commercial appearance. There
shall be no separate entrance created solely for the home occupation.
            iii.   All home occupation activities shall take place in the
dwelling and there shall be no use of an outdoor area or accessory structures
for the home occupation, including for storage of materials, goods, supplies,
or equipment. A home occupation may be permitted in an accessory building if
approved by the Planning Commission through a conditional use approval.
            iv.   The sale of goods or services shall be limited to:
               a)   Products that are produced or processed on the premises;
or,
               b)   The sale of goods as part of a mail order, online business,
or direct sale product distribution (e.g., Amway, Avon, Creative Memories,
Pampered Chef, etc.) where there is no stock-in-trade on the site.
            v.   No equipment shall be used which will create any dust, noise,
odors, glare, vibrations or electrical disturbances beyond the lot.
            vi.   Activities conducted and equipment or material used shall not
change the fire safety or occupancy classifications of the premises.
            vii.   Only residents of the dwelling shall operate the home
occupation.
            viii.   The operator of a home occupation in a rental unit shall be
able to demonstrate that the property owner has authorized the use of the unit
for a home occupation.
            ix.   No more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the floor area of
the dwelling unit shall be devoted to such home occupations.
            x.   There shall be no signs other than the wall signs allowed on a
dwelling in Section
1123.02(h).
            xi.   No additional off-street parking or loading facilities shall
be provided beyond that traditionally used for residential uses. No additional
driveways shall be established for the use of the home occupation.
            xii.   Traffic shall not be generated by such home occupation in
significantly greater volume than would normally be expected in the residential
neighborhood.
            xiii.   There shall be no window display or outdoor storage or
display of equipment, materials, or supplies associated with the home
occupation.
            xiv.   When any home occupation results in an undesirable condition
interfering with the general welfare of the surrounding residential area, such
home occupation may be terminated by the Director of Community Development.
         B.   Prohibited Home Occupations. The following are business
activities that are prohibited as home occupations:
            i.   Animal hospitals and boarding facilities;
            ii.   Automotive and other vehicle repair and service, except when
such repair or service is within an attached garage and the vehicle is owned or
leased by the occupant of the dwelling units.
            iii.   Construction, landscaping, or similar contractor facilities
and storage (an office-only use is allowed in compliance with the above
section) and other outdoor storage;
            iv.   Fitness/health facilities that provide group activities or
services;

required, a yard for any structure shall be located on the same lot as the
structure and shall not include any yard or open space areas from an adjacent
lot.
         B.   While a yard is defined as an open area, certain structures and
uses may be permitted in required yards as specified in this code.
         C.   Where the term "required" is used before any yard type, that
required yard shall be the area of the yard between the applicable lot line and
the required yard setback distance from the applicable lot line, regardless of
the presence of a building. See Figure 1113-A.

Figure 1113-A: The above image illustrates the use of the term "required yards"
on a typical interior lot versus the location of the full front, side, and rear
yards as defined in the next sections of this code.
      (2)   Measurements and Exceptions.
         A.   Setbacks refer to the unobstructed, unoccupied open area between
the foundation or base of a structure and the property line (lot line) of the
lot on which the structure is located. Setbacks shall not contain any structure
except when in conformance with this code.
         B.   A setback shall not be reduced in any manner to less than the
required dimensions for the district in which it is located, and a setback of
less than the required dimensions shall not be further reduced in any manner
unless otherwise noted in this code (e.g., nonconforming structures or by
variances).
         C.   Front Yard Exception for Partially Built-Up Blocks. Where fifty
percent (50%) or more of the block face on which a principal building is to be
constructed, is occupied by buildings of the type and use permitted in the
district before the effective date of this code, with a front yard setback of
less than required by this code, the minimum front yard for new buildings shall
be no less than the average setback distance of existing buildings located
within 100 feet on either side of the applicable lot. However, front yard
setback resulting therefrom shall not be less than one-half of the dimensions
specified in the schedule in Table 1113-3. See Figure 1113-B.

            v.   For signage as allowed in this code;
            vi.   Walls and fences as permitted in accordance with Section
1113.06;
            vii.   For the ordinary projections that are a part or feature of a
building which extends or projects outside of the exterior, enclosing facades.
It is intended that certain features may project into required yards, but they
shall be regulated so as not to substantially interfere with the reception of
sun, light, air and the use of adjacent lots as follows:
               a)   Architectural features such as a belt course, balcony,
cornice, gutter or chimney may project into a front and side yard for a
distance of two (2) feet;
               b)   Entrance features such as an open platform, landing, steps,
terrace, or other feature not extending above the first-floor level of a
building may extend six (6) feet into a front yard and three (3) feet into a
side yard.
               c)   An unenclosed shelter (e.g., entrance hood or open, but
roofed porch), open deck, porch, platform, landing, steps, terrace or other
feature that is not fully enclosed and does not extend above the first-floor
level of a building may extend:
                  1)   Ten (10) feet into the front yard provided such
encroachment does not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the width of the front
building facade;
                  2)   Six (6) feet into a front yard along the entire width of
the front building facade; and
                  3)   Three (3) feet into a side yard.
               d)   An enclosed entry or porch shall not project into any
required yard area. See also Section
1113.01(d)(2)D.
      (3)   Lot Configurations and Rules for Setbacks and Yards.
         A.   Interior Lots.
            i.   Unless otherwise stated, the required minimum front yard
setback shall be measured from the street right-of-way or, where a right-of-way
is not identified, the front lot line. See Figure 1113-C.
            ii.   The lot line located directly behind the rear of the
structure, as determined by the Director of Community Development, shall be the
rear lot line and the rear yard setback shall be applied. See Figure 1113-C.
            iii.   All other lot lines shall be considered the side lot line
and the side yard setback shall be applied. See Figure 1113-C.

Figure 1113-C: Typical setback and yard locations for an interior lot.
         B.   Corner Lots. Lots that have street frontage on two intersecting
streets shall be considered a corner lot, subject to the following:
            i.   The lot line that runs parallel with the front facade of the
building on the rear of the lot shall be the rear lot line, and the minimum
rear yard setback shall be applied from such lot line. See Figure 1113-D.
            ii.   All other lot lines shall be a side lot line, and the minimum
side yard setback shall be applied from such lot lines. See Figure 1113-D.
            iii.   In residential districts, the required minimum front yard
setback shall be provided from each street right-of-way or, where a right-of-
way is not identified, the lot line adjacent to the street. See Figure 1113-D.
Where the rear yard of the corner lot abuts the rear yard of the adjacent lot,
the front yard along the side street (parallel with the side of the building)
may be reduced to twenty (20) feet. See Figure 1113-E.
            iv.   In the OB, LB, GB, CBD, and SM-D Districts, the front yard
requirement on the side street may be reduced to ten (10) feet.
            v.   An alley shall not be considered a street for the purposes of
determining a corner lot.
            vi.   Such setbacks and yard locations shall apply, regardless of
the orientation of the building.
            vii.   Buildings on corner lots should be oriented to face the
street on which the lot has the narrowest frontage but may also be oriented
toward the corner of the lot, in which case, the setbacks and yard locations
shall be as illustrated in Figure 1113-F.

way shall be considered as side yards and shall have the required minimum side
yard setback provided for each side lot line. See Figure 1113-G.
            iii.   For the purposes of allowing accessory uses and fences,
which are allowed in a rear yard, the yard that is located to the rear of the
principal building shall be considered the rear yard and the setbacks of
Section
1113.01(d) shall apply to all accessory uses or structures. Such accessory uses
or structures shall not be permitted in the required front yard areas adjacent
to each street.
            iv.   Where alleys exist in the City, any lots that have frontage
along the alley shall not be considered a double frontage (through) lot and
shall either be regulated as an interior lot or corner lot depending on the
location of the subject lot within the block.
         D.   Panhandle (Flag) Lots. Panhandle lots (flag) lots shall be
discouraged and shall only be approved if necessitated by unique topographic
features or other special physical conditions as deemed necessary by the

   (g)   Maximum Lot Coverage.
      (1)   Measurement. Where used, lot coverage is that portion of a lot, or
a specified yard, which when viewed directly from above, would be covered by
principal and accessory buildings. Decks, pervious paver blocks, driveways,
patios, parking lots, and structures that are not buildings shall not count as
impervious surfaces. The Director of Community Development shall have the final
determination of what are considered buildings and the total coverage that is
considered impervious surfaces.
      (2)   Maximum Lot Coverage Standards.
         Table 1113-5 establishes the maximum lot coverage for all buildings on
an individual lot within the applicable district.

   1113.02 INTERSECTION VISIBILITY.
   No fence, wall, sign, structure, vehicle, or planting shall be erected,
established or maintained on any lot which will obstruct the view of drivers in
vehicles approaching an intersection of two (2) roads or the intersection of a
road and a driveway or curb cut. Fences, walls, signs, structures, vehicles or
plantings located in the triangular area described below shall not be permitted
to obstruct cross-visibility between a height of thirty (30) inches and five
(5) feet above the lowest point of the intersecting roads. The unobstructed
triangular area is described as follows:
   (a)   At intersections of driveways with streets, the sight triangle shall
be established by locating the intersection of the street curb with the
driveway edge, and by measuring from this point a distance of ten (10) feet
along the driveway to a point and a distance of twenty (20) feet along the
street curb to a point and connecting these points.
   (b)   At street intersections, the sight triangle shall be formed by
measuring at least thirty-five (35) feet along curb lines and connecting these
points. Within the first twenty (20) feet of the street intersection sight
triangles, no structure or landscaping material is permitted except required
ground cover. Within the portion of sight triangle that is located between
twenty (20) feet and thirty-five (35) feet, signs and trees shall be permitted
only when the pole or trunk is the only part of a sign or tree that is visible
between the ground and five (5) feet above the ground, or otherwise does not
present a traffic visibility hazard.
      (Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1113.03 OUTDOOR LIGHTING.
   (a)   Purpose.
      (1)   The overall purpose of this section is to control the installation
of outdoor lighting fixtures to prevent light pollution in the forms of light
trespass and glare, and to preserve, protect, and enhance the character of the
City and the lawful nighttime use and enjoyment of property located within the
City. Appropriate site lighting, including lights for signs, buildings and
streets, shall be arranged so as to provide safety, utility and security, and
to control light trespass and glare on adjacent properties and public roadways.
      (2)   In addition to the overall purpose above, outdoor lighting is a
central element of the Sharonville NLO District where development is encouraged
to have a multi-layered lighting design that reinforces the Sharonville
Northern Lights vision throughout the district. The use of lighting in all
architectural and landscaping elements in the district provides opportunity to
immerse the viewer in the district experience. The ambience of the lighting
will encourage interaction of visitors with the surrounding environment.
   (b)   Applicability. The standards of this section shall apply to all
development activities, subject to review under this code, with the following
exceptions:
      (1)   Lighting related to single-family dwellings are exempt; however,
all lighting for these uses, with the exception of low-voltage landscaping
lighting, shall be completely shielded from adjacent properties.
      (2)   Decorative outdoor lighting fixtures with bulbs of less than twenty
-five (25) watts, installed seasonally, are exempt from the requirements of
this section.
      (3)   Fully shielded decorative lighting attached to a building or placed
in landscaping and directed onto a building shall be exempt from the
requirements of this section, provided direct light emissions are not intended
to be visible above the building's roof line. This exception shall not include
decorative lighting used to illuminate a sign, which is regulated by Chapter
1123: Signs.
      (4)   Light fixtures used to illuminate flags, statutes, and any other
objects mounted on a pole, pedestal, or platform shall be exempt from the
requirements of this section, provided these objects are illuminated using a
narrow cone beam or light fixtures designed to minimize light spillage beyond
the illuminated object.
      (5)   Lighting for certain outdoor recreational uses, because of their
unique requirements for nighttime visibility and their limited hours of
operation, are exempt from this section. However, such uses, including but not
limited to, ball diamonds, playing fields, tennis courts and other similar
outdoor recreational uses, shall be required to meet the following standards:
         A.   Cutoff from a lighting source that illuminates an outdoor
recreational use may exceed an angle of ninety (90) degrees from the pole,
provided that the luminaries are shielded to prevent light and glare to spill
over to adjacent residential properties.
         B.   The maximum permitted illumination at the lot lines shall be two
footcandles.
         C.   Exterior lighting for an outdoor recreational use shall be
extinguished no later than 11:00 p.m.
      (6)   Temporary construction or emergency lighting is exempt from the
requirements of this section. Such lighting shall be discontinued immediately
upon completion of the construction work or abatement of the emergency
necessitating such lighting.
      (7)   Nothing in this chapter shall apply to lighting required by the FAA
or any other federal regulatory authority.
   (c)   Applicability and Exterior Lighting Plan.
      (1)   A lighting plan is required for all uses that are required to file
for site plan review and shall be approved according to the procedures set
forth in Section
1129.07. Such lighting plan shall not be required to include a photometric
study unless the proposed use is a multi-family dwelling with ten (10) or more
units or a nonresidential use is proposed to be located adjacent to a lot in a
residential district or that is occupied by an existing residential use.
      (2)   All existing uses on which outdoor lighting is installed or changed
shall conform to these standards, regardless if a lighting plan is required.
      (3)   The lighting plan shall demonstrate compliance with the outdoor
lighting standards of this section.
   (d)   General Requirements.
      (1)   All outdoor lighting fixtures regulated according to this section,
including but not limited to those used for parking areas, buildings, building
overhangs, canopies, signs, displays and landscaping, shall be full-cutoff type
fixtures, unless exempted per Section
1113.03(b).
         A.   Any use that has a canopy with lighting fixtures attached to the
bottom of the canopy shall utilize recessed ceiling fixtures.
         B.   Signs that are wholly illuminated from within and freestanding
signs that are externally illuminated with an exposed incandescent lamp not
exceeding forty (40) watts shall not require shielding.
         C.   Non-cutoff luminaires may be used when the maximum initial lumens
generated by each luminaire shall not exceed 9500 initial lamp lumens per
luminaire.

areas, and signs shall be designed so as not to shine onto any adjacent
residential property or building, or to cause glare onto any public street or
vehicle thereon.
      (3)   Illumination that is required consistently across the site shall be
designed so as not to create dark spots that may create safety issues in such
areas as vehicular use areas and connecting pedestrian paths.
      (4)   For all nonresidential uses in any residential district, all
outdoor lighting fixtures, including parking, display, and aesthetic lighting,
shall be turned off after business hours. Only that lighting needed for safety
or security may remain lit after close of business, in which case the lighting
shall be reduced to the minimum level necessary.
      (5)   The lighting under vehicular canopies shall be designed so as not
to create glare off-site, with a maximum point of horizontal illuminance of
24.0 maintained footcandles. Acceptable lighting methods include one or more of
the following:
         A.   Recessed luminaire incorporating a lens cover that is either
recessed or flush with the bottom surface (ceiling) of the vehicular canopy;

provides a cutoff optic or shielded light distribution;
         D.   Surface mounted luminaire, typically measuring two (2) feet by
two (2) feet, with a lens cover that contains at least two percent (2%) white
fill diffusion material; or
         E.   Indirect lighting where light is beamed upward and then reflected
down from the underside of the vehicular canopy. Such luminaires shall be
shielded such that direct illumination is focused exclusively on the underside
of the vehicular canopy.
      (6)   There shall be a maximum illumination of 0.5 footcandles at the lot
line in all residential districts and for any nonresidential use that abuts a
lot in a residential zoning district or lot occupied by an existing residential
use.
      (7)   There shall be a maximum illumination level of 0.2 footcandles
along any street right-of-way.
      (8)   Beyond the maximum illumination levels above, the outdoor lighting
shall produce an average light level along pedestrian walkways of at least 0.6
maintained footcandles.

a certificate of zoning approval, unless specifically exempted from the permit
requirement in this code.
      (2)   Certificates of zoning approval are not required for repairs of
existing fences or walls. However, such work or structures are still subject to
the applicable standards of this section. The replacement of an existing fence
or wall shall not require a certificate of zoning approval if the replacement
is for a conforming fence or wall and where the materials and height of the
fence or wall are the same as the one being replaced.
      (3)   Replacement of nonconforming fences or walls shall be subject to
Section
1113.06(c).
      (4)   A certificate of zoning approval is not required for fence or wall
structures that are less than two (2) feet in height.
      (5)   A certificate of zoning approval shall not be required for short
sections of fencing or walls that are designed as an architectural feature or
utilized for decorative purposes and are not intended to enclose an area of
land. Such sections shall not exceed twenty-five (25) feet in length and shall
comply with the vision clearance requirements of this code.
      (6)   Hedges, shrubbery, trees, bushes and plantings shall be excluded
from classification as fences but shall be subject to the intersection
visibility requirements of this code. See Section
1113.02.
   (b)   General Requirements.
      (1)   Unless a specific distinction is made in this section, any
regulation that applies to fences shall apply to walls and vice versa.
      (2)   All fences and walls shall be subject to the intersection
visibility requirements of Section
1113.02.
      (3)   All fences and walls, and any related supporting structures or
appurtenances, shall be contained within the lot lines of the applicable lot
and shall not encroach into adjoining or abutting lots and/or rights-of-way.
Property owners, with written permission from abutting property owners, may
connect to fences or walls on adjoining properties.
      (4)   A certificate of zoning approval shall be required for each
property when a connection of existing fences or walls is proposed on two (2)
or more different properties. Such applications shall also include signatures
of all property owners to document the agreement of such connection.
      (5)   Fences or walls are permitted along property lines provided only
one fence is located on the lot line. Where separate fences or walls are
proposed for adjacent properties, such fences and walls shall be separated by
two and one-half (2½) feet for maintenance.
      (6)   The smooth finished side of the fence or wall shall be the side of
the fence that faces outward from the lot or yard being fenced. If a fence has
two (2) similarly finished sides, either side may face the adjacent property.
      (7)   Posts, poles, or other mechanisms used to secure the fence to the
ground or support the fence shall be located on the inside of the fence (i.e.,
located on the property of the applicant).
      (8)   All diagonal or supporting members shall face the property on which
the fence or wall is constructed.
      (9)   All fences and walls shall be maintained in a neat and orderly
manner. This shall include keeping fences and walls clear of vegetation and
growth unless such fence or wall is being used for a living fence (e.g., ivy
walls), in which case, such fence or wall shall be maintained in a manner as to
prevent such vegetative growth from encroaching onto the side of the fence or
wall facing a neighboring lot.
      (10)   Walls shall be prohibited within all utility easements. Fences
that are placed in utility easements shall require the written permission from
the applicable utility company. Without such permission, fences are subject to
removal without notice by utility companies or the City when work is being done
in the utility easements. Fences shall not be placed in any City easement
unless the plat specifically permits the placement of such fence. The City of
Sharonville is not responsible for the determination of easements on private
properties.
      (11)   Replacement of fences removed by the City or utility company shall
be at the property owner's expense.
      (12)   Fences and walls shall not impede, inhibit, or obstruct culverts,

shall be designed to direct water to drainage channels or other outlets to
eliminate the possibility of the accumulation of water behind the wall.
      (13)   Fences and walls for conditional uses shall comply with the
standards of this section unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission
as part of the conditional use review procedure.
      (14)   It shall be the duty of each lot owner and contractor, or an agent
thereof, to determine lot lines and to ascertain that the fence or wall does
not deviate from the plans as approved by the Director of Community Development
issuing the certificate of zoning approval, and that the fence does not
encroach on another lot or existing easement. The issuance of the certificate
of zoning approval and any inspection by the City shall not be construed to
mean that the City has determined the fence is not encroaching on another lot,
nor shall it relieve the property owner of the duty imposed on them herein.
   (c)   Nonconforming Fences and Walls.
      (1)   Where a nonconforming fence or wall is to be maintained or
repaired, such nonconforming fence or wall may continue to exist. Repair or
maintenance shall include any general maintenance of a fence or wall while

repair or maintenance work provided the same fence or wall is replaced in the
same position.
      (2)   If fifty percent (50%) or more of the length of a nonconforming
fence or wall is to be removed and replaced, even as part of maintenance, such
replacement shall conform with the requirements of this code and shall require
the issuance of a new certificate of zoning approval. Such fifty percent (50%)
shall be the aggregate over the course of time, following the effective date of
this code so that full, conforming replacement shall be required once fifty
percent (50%) of the length has been removed, no matter if done as a whole or
partially over time.

Historic Preservation
1115.01   Purpose and intent.
1115.02   Limitations on issuance of building, zoning, and demolition permits.
1115.03   Historic preservation standards.
   1115.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to preserve and protect historic
properties in the City of Sharonville, and any subsequently designated local
landmarks, historic district(s), contributing buildings, and historic sites. In
order to preserve and protect the historic character of existing and future
historic districts and/or landmarks, the regulations of this chapter are
imposed in addition to other regulations in this code.
   (b)   The character of the City is directly linked to the economic, social,
historical, and cultural health and well-being of the community. Therefore,
this chapter establishes procedures to maintain the historic character of
select landmarks and/or districts within the City in order to obtain the
following objectives:
      (1)   To enhance the Sharonville Comprehensive Plan and safeguard the
City's attractions to prospective residents, businesses and visitors by
preserving the distinctive character of historic landmarks and/or districts;
      (2)   To safeguard the architectural integrity of the City's landmark
buildings and allow for future addition of landmarks and/or districts to the
list contained herein;
      (3)   To safeguard the heritage of the City by preserving sites,
buildings, objects, landscapes and works of art that reflect elements of the
City's cultural, social, economic, political or architectural heritage;
      (4)   To seek alternatives to demolition or incompatible alterations of
landmarks and/or districts within the City before such acts are performed;
      (5)   To afford the widest possible scope of continuing vitality through
private renewal and architectural creativity within appropriate controls and
standards;
      (6)   To encourage the use or appropriate development of vacant
properties, as applicable, in accordance with the character of landmarks and/or
districts;
      (7)   To combat urban blight caused by neglect of aging buildings, sites
and districts and their setting;
      (8)   To encourage investment in historic resources and strengthening of
the City's economy;
      (9)   To enhance the environmental and aesthetic quality of the City;
      (10)   To stabilize and improve property values;

buildings; and
      (12)   To protect public health, safety, convenience, comfort,
prosperity, and general welfare.
   (c)   It is the further intent of this chapter to discourage the
construction of major new buildings on lots containing historic landmarks and
the subdivision of lots containing historic landmarks for the construction of
new buildings in close proximity to any landmark buildings.
(Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1115.02 LIMITATIONS ON ISSUANCE OF BUILDING, ZONING, AND DEMOLITION PERMITS.
   No construction, reconstruction, addition, demolition or removal of any
building or significant exterior architectural feature thereof to any listed
landmark, contributing building, or any other structure within an historic
district shall be undertaken prior to obtaining a Certificate of
Appropriateness (COA) from the Planning Commission and a certificate of zoning
approval, where applicable. No certificate of zoning approval shall be issued
for the construction, addition, demolition or removal of a listed landmark,
contributing building or noncontributing building and historic sites, in or
outside of a historic district, except in cases falling within the exclusion
set forth in this code, unless the application for such work is approved by the
Planning Commission through the issuance of a COA in the manner prescribed in
Section
1129.08.
(Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1115.03 HISTORIC PRESERVATION STANDARDS.
   (a)   Design Requirements and Guidelines for Existing Landmarks or
Contributing Buildings.
      (1)   Alterations.
         A.   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved.
         B.   The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
         C.   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, to the maximum extent practicable.
         D.   Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials.
         E.   Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by
documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
      (2)   Additions. New additions, exterior alterations, or related new
construction should be compatible in character with the original building. They
should be sympathetic but not duplicative in design. In general, additions
should avoid changing significant elevations that are visible from public
rights-of-way and should not overpower the original building.
      (3)   Materials. Buildings shall have exterior materials of painted wood,
brick, stucco, stone masonry, or other materials deemed appropriate by the
Planning Commission. Vinyl, aluminum and synthetic stucco are not appropriate.
      (4)   Window and Door Openings.
         A.   Window and door openings are a major character-defining feature
of a building and usually occupy twenty percent (20%) to fifty percent (50%) of
the front elevation. They are typically vertically aligned and proportioned
with a 2:1 ratio of height to width and defined by elements such as lintels and
sills. The original openings should be maintained.
         B.   New windows should have a configuration that is historically
appropriate such as one-over-one, two-over-two or six-over-six double-hung
sashes.
         C.   Tinted or reflective glass is not appropriate.
      (5)   Scale and Massing. Overall building height to width ratios, chimney
construction, roof pitch, footprint size, both absolute footprint size and size
relative to lot size, placement and orientation, and other pertinent data, as
deemed important to the overall building appearance shall be considered in the
design of any addition, alteration or replacement of existing structures.
      (6)   Accessory Buildings. Accessory buildings exceeding 300 square feet
of floor area shall be of the same architectural style and same exterior
material as the main building unless the accessory building is a reconstruction
of an accessory building that previously existed on the lot, in which case
substantial freedom shall be afforded the applicant to replicate the structure
as it previously existed.
   (b)   Design Requirements for New Buildings in Historic Districts.
      (1)   Scale and Massing. New buildings shall be similar in size, scale,
mass and architectural style as the surrounding contributing buildings. Overall
building height-to-width ratios, roof pitch, size, placement, orientation, and
other pertinent data, as deemed important to the overall building appearance
shall be considered in the design of any new or replacement structures.
      (2)   Materials. New buildings shall have exterior materials of painted
wood, brick, stucco, or stone masonry, or other material deemed appropriate by
the Planning Commission. Vinyl, aluminum and synthetic stucco are not
appropriate.
      (3)   Window and Door Openings. Window and door openings are a major
character-defining feature of a building and usually occupy twenty percent
(20%) to fifty percent (50%) of the front elevation. They are typically aligned
vertically with a 2:1 ratio of height to width and defined by elements such as
lintels and sills. New windows should have a configuration that is historically
appropriate such as one-over-one, two-over-two or six-over-six double-hung
sashes. In all cases, glass should be clear; tinted or reflective glass is not
appropriate.
      (4)   Site Location of New Buildings. In order to maintain historic
landscapes around landmarks and contributing buildings, no new buildings shall
be built on lots in front of landmarks or contributing buildings. New lots can
be next to or behind landmarks and contributing buildings. New buildings shall
have front yard setbacks similar to surrounding contributing buildings,
provided that no new front yard of greater than fifty (50) feet shall be
required.
      (5)   Garages. In order to maintain the characteristics of a historic
district, no new house may be built with garage doors on the front elevation of
said house facing the street. For corner lots, garage doors may face the street
on the side elevation. Detached garages built behind the rear elevation of new
or existing houses may have garage doors facing the front or side of the lot.
      (6)   Accessory Buildings. Accessory buildings exceeding 300 square feet
of floor area shall be of the same architectural style and same exterior
material as the main building unless the accessory building is a reconstruction
of an accessory building that previously existed on the lot, in which case
substantial freedom shall be afforded the applicant to replicate the structure
as it previously existed.
   
   (c)   Design Guidelines for Site Improvements to Landmarks and Historic
Sites.
      (1)   Building Signage. Any sign requiring a permit from the City, which
is proposed to be attached to a landmark or contributing building shall be of
material and style harmonious with the building and its surroundings. All such
signs shall be presented to the Planning Commission for a Certificate of
Appropriateness approval prior to initiation or erection of such sign.
      (2)   Parking and Paving. Reducing green space by adding additional
pavement for driveways or parking areas should be limited whenever possible.
New driveways and parking areas shall respect existing contours and natural
features and be set back from adjoining property lines at least five (5) feet.
   (d)   Demolition. The demolition of existing buildings shall not be
unreasonably denied. The Planning Commission shall consider the following
criteria in evaluating applications for demolition.
      (1)   Public Safety. Demolition has been ordered by the Building Official
for public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition that constitutes
an emergency.
      (2)   Commercial Property. The owner can demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the Planning Commission that the building cannot be reused nor can a
reasonable economic return be gained from the use of all or part of the
building proposed for demolition.
      (3)   Dwellings and Accessory Buildings. The owner can demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Planning Commission that the building cannot be
economically restored and will not adversely affect the character of the City.
      (4)   Nonsignificant Items. The demolition request is for an
inappropriate addition or a nonsignificant portion of building and the
demolition will not adversely affect those parts of the building that are
significant as determined by the Planning Commission.
      (5)   Noncontributing Buildings. Noncontributing buildings may be
demolished if the demolition will not adversely affect the character of the
district. Any new construction on the cleared site will be subject to the
guidelines for new construction and site improvements.
      (6)   Demolition by Neglect. No owner of a building or structure in the
historic district shall by action(s) or willful neglect, fail to provide
sufficient and reasonable care, maintenance and upkeep to ensure such
building's or structure's perpetuation and to prevent destruction of such
building or structure by deterioration.
   (e)   Subdivision of Lots Containing Landmark Buildings.
      (1)   The subdivision of any lot containing a landmark shall be
accomplished in such way that both the new lot and reduced lot conform to the
minimum lot size in the zoning district and shall provide sufficient space so
that a minimum thirty (30)-foot distance is maintained between any landmark
building and any structure proposed on the new lot.
      (2)   Any new lot created from the subdivision of a lot containing a
landmark must be at least one-half the size of the remaining portion of the lot
containing the landmark.

a minimum dimension of five (5) feet in any direction to provide a suitable
living environment for the landscaping.
      (7)   If an existing tree is to be used to meet the requirements of this
subsection, the landscape island shall be equal in size to the tree's drip line
area to protect the root system of the existing tree.
         (Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1119.06 SCREENING.
   (a)   Screening of Service Areas. In addition to the other forms of required
landscaping, screening shall be required to conceal specific areas of high
visual or auditory impact or hazardous areas from adjacent, less intensive uses
and from views from public rights-of-way. Such areas shall be screened at all
times, unless otherwise specified, regardless of adjacent uses, districts, or
other proximate landscaping material.
      (1)   The following areas shall be screened in accordance with this
section:
         A.   Large waste receptacles (e.g., dumpsters and cardboard recycling
containers) and refuse collection areas;
         B.   Accessory outdoor storage and bulk sales;
         C.   Pipes, conduit, and cables associated with the building or use;
         D.   Outdoor service areas that are necessary to support common
business operations (e.g., outdoor freezer or refrigeration units, storage
units, etc.);
         E.   Ground-level or facade-mounted mechanical equipment; and
         F.   Roof top equipment that is not otherwise hidden by the roofline,
parapet wall, or other similar feature.
      (2)   Screening shall not be required if any of the above items are not
visible from adjacent rights-of-way or from adjacent lots in residential zoning
districts.
      (3)   All sides of the item shall be screened with the exception that one
side of the item may be screened with a gate or other similar feature to allow
access while screening the item when access is not necessary.
      (4)   Screening Methods.
         A.   The following items are permitted for use as screening materials,
and more than one method may be used on a lot or site.
            i.   Vegetative materials that provide a fully opaque screen to the
minimum height necessary to fully screen the facility from off-site views (See
Figure 1119-C.); or
            ii.   An opaque fence or wall consistent with the standards of
Section
1113.06; or
            iii.   Integration into the building design (e.g., false walls or
other architectural screening) that utilizes the same building materials and
colors as the principal building.

Figure 1119-C: The above image illustrates a vegetative screen that hides
HVAC equipment and a dumpster.
         B.   The required screening shall have a height sufficient enough to
screen the applicable item(s) provided it is in accordance with any other
applicable sections of this code.
         C.   To the maximum extent feasible, pipes, conduit, and cables should
be located along the rear facade of buildings if conditions do not allow for
them to be enclosed within the building itself. Pipes, conduit, and cables
shall be located as far away from public view as practical and shall be painted
a similar color as the building facade to further reduce visibility.
         D.   In all cases, fences and walls are limited to the heights allowed
by Section
1113.06 unless the wall used for screening is an extension of the principal
building, in which case, the wall may be the same height as the principal
building wall that from which it is extended. See Figure 1119-D.

Figure 1119-D: The above image illustrates a wall and fence that is an
extension of the principal building that is designed to screen outdoor storage
areas.
   (b)   Screening between Land Uses. This section shall provide for the
screening of land uses that may be of a different intensity, or are otherwise
incompatible, for the purposes of mitigating impacts such as parking areas,
noises, and other potential effects. Screening of land use shall be established
in the following manner:
      (1)   In Table 1119-2, identify the required screen type by locating the
district in which the proposed use is in along the left-hand column. The
required screen type will be in the right two columns based on the adjacent
residential uses.
      (2)   Screen types are identified by a letter. Where nonresidential
districts are adjacent to other nonresidential zoning districts, screening
between land uses will not be required.
      (3)   Find the screen type in Table 1119-3, which identifies the minimum
screen to be established as required in this chapter. An alternative screening
type may be proposed in accordance with Section
1129.10.

displayed any more than two used motor vehicles for casual sale at any one
time.
   (l)   Bicycle and e-Scooter Parking. When bicycle or e-Scooter parking
accommodations are provided on a site, they shall be located in an area
adjacent to the primary building and separate from vehicular or pedestrian
traffic circulation to prevent unnecessary conflicts and safety hazards between
vehicles, people, bicycles and e-Scooters.
      (Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1121.04 OFF-STREET PARKING STANDARDS.
   (a)   Number of Parking Spaces Required.
      (1)   Computation. In computing the number of parking spaces required by
this code, the following shall apply:
         A.   Where floor area is designated as the standard for determining
parking space requirements, floor area shall be as defined by this code but is
not intended to mean gross floor area.
         B.   Where seating capacity is designated as the standard for
determining parking space requirements, the capacity shall mean the number of
seating units installed, and where individual seats are not provided (bench,
pew, etc.), one seat shall be for each twenty-four (24) lineal inches of
seating facilities.
         C.   Fractional numbers shall be increased to the next highest whole
number.
         D.   Parking spaces shall be provided according to the schedule of
uses in this subsection. In residential use areas, garages or carports may be
counted as a part of the required parking.
      (2)   Mixed Use Occupancy. In the case of mixed or multiple uses in one
building or on one property, the total requirements for off-street parking may
be reduced as follows:
         A.   The reduction shall be based on the sum of the minimum parking
spaces required in the table in this subsection, computed separately, and
reduced by not more than twenty-five percent (25%). Any reduction in spaces
shall be reviewed and approved by the Director of Community Development.
         B.   The remaining spaces shall not be reserved for any one use and
shall be available to all patrons or residents of that development.
   
   (b)   Number of Parking Spaces Required. The number of off-street parking
spaces required shall be based on the requirements of Section
1121.04(b)(1) below, or an alternative parking space plan may be provided in
accordance with Section
1121.04(b)(2).
      (1)   Minimum Parking Spaces Table.
         A.   Table 1121-3 establishes the minimum number of parking spaces
required for individual uses. For uses that are not specifically stated, the
Director of Community Development may identify a parking requirement that most
closely reflects the land use and intensity of the proposed use or may require
an alternative parking space plan as established in Section
1121.04(b)(2).
         B.   In order to prevent excessive lot coverage, the artificial
increase in ambient air temperature, and an unnecessary increase in surface
water run-off, no application shall propose more than twenty-five percent (25%)
of the spaces required in Table 1121-3 unless good cause can be shown by the
applicant and approved by the BZA through the variance process. Single-family
dwellings and two-family dwellings shall be exempt from this provision.
         C.   An alternative parking space plan is not permitted for uses
marked with an asterisk (*) in Table 1121-3. An alternative parking space plan
shall only be permitted when the applicant wants to propose less than the
number required by Table 1121-3.
         D.   The required spaces as determined by the schedule and standards
in this section may be modified by the Planning Commission in the CBD District
where free parking areas or publicly owned parking areas are readily accessible
and where land is not available for development of accessory off-street parking
as required herein.

vehicular access by means of a driveway, or driveways, to a public street in a
manner which shall least interfere with adjacent traffic movements and interior
circulation. The access drive of an off-street loading facility shall be
located so that the driveway center line shall not be less than fifty (50) feet
from the nearest intersecting street right-of-way line.

be measured in accordance with Table 1121-6 with the spaces located after the
convergence point counting toward both stacking lanes.
      (4)   Vehicles shall not be permitted to wait within the public right-of-
way for service at such drive-in or drive-thru facilities.
   (d)   The Planning Commission may reduce the number of required stacking
spaces when the applicant provides credible documentation, such as studies from
similar sites, that fewer than the required number of stacking spaces does not
impede vehicular traffic flow on the site and ingress/egress to the site.

   It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to establish reasonable
regulations which preserve the public health, safety, convenience, comfort,
prosperity and general welfare of the public, while protecting each person's
constitutional right to freedom of speech, as indicated by the following
objectives:
   (a)   To prohibit signs which pose an unreasonable risk to the public
safety;
   (b)   To limit the visual dominance of signs without unconstitutionally
restricting the information conveyed;
   (c)   To provide for reasonable and appropriate methods for locating goods,
services, and facilities in all zoning districts by relating the size, type and
design of signs to the size, type and design of the uses and districts;
   (d)   To control the design of signs so that their appearance shall be
aesthetically harmonious with an overall urban design for the area;
   (e)   To promote traffic safety by preventing obstructions within public
rights-of-way, minimizing visual distractions to motorists, ensuring that sign
size and height are appropriate to their location and preventing conflicts with
public safety signs and police and fire protection;
   (f)   To promote the most desirable developments and economic activity in
accordance with the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan; and
   (g)   To promote the public right to receive religious, political, economic,
social, philosophical and other First Amendment protected messages.

   Unless otherwise specifically stated, the following regulations shall apply
to all signs within the City:
   (a)   All signs shall be professionally manufactured, or of equivalent
quality. Permanent signs shall be fabricated with rigid materials that are of
good quality and good durability.
   (b)   The construction, erection, safety, and maintenance shall comply with
all applicable building and electrical codes. In the event there is a conflict
between the provisions of this section and the provisions of any applicable
building or electrical codes, the provisions of the more restrictive code shall
govern.
   (c)   No sign or sign structure shall be placed on private or public
property without the consent of the owner or agent thereof.
   (d)   The lowest component of all signs that project (or are supported on
posts that project) shall not be less than eight (8) feet above the finished
grade of a sidewalk or any other pedestrian way. If located over a pavement
used for vehicular traffic or within eighteen (18) inches of the vertical
projection of the edges of such pavement, the lowest component of the sign
shall not be less than fifteen (15) feet above the finished pavement.
   (e)   Signs shall be anchored to prevent any lateral movement that would
cause wear on supporting members or connections.
   (f)   All signs shall be subject to the intersection visibility standards
established in Section
1113.02.
   (g)   Permitted permanent signs should be designed so as to be similar in
character with regard to materials, color and size to signs designed or located
on the same building and on adjoining buildings in order to equalize the
attention they are meant to attract, and to produce an overall unified effect,
and shall also be designed in accordance with the standards set forth in this
section.
   (h)   The back side of all permanent signs that do not contain a second sign
face or structural supports shall be completely enclosed.
   (i)   Signs in Rights-of-Way.
      (1)   Signs shall be prohibited in the right-of-way with the exception
of:
         A.   Signs installed by the City of Sharonville, Butler or Hamilton
Counties, the State of Ohio, federal government, or public transit agencies;
         B.   Any warning signs or traffic safety signs required by public

signs shall be permitted to be illuminated in compliance with the following:
      (1)   Where illuminated signs are permitted, such illumination may be
through internal or external lighting sources.
      (2)   Light sources shall be shielded from all adjacent buildings and
streets and shall be focused exclusively on the sign.
      (3)   Lights shall not be of such brightness so as to cause glare that is
hazardous to pedestrians or motorists, or will cause reasonable objection from
adjacent residential districts.
      (4)   An illuminated sign or lighting device shall employ only light of
constant intensity.
      (5)   In the NLO District, internally illuminated signs that have a
translucent background shall be avoided. Applicants shall utilize an opaque
background with translucent text.

signs that are allowed as part of permitted signs. See Section
1123.08(a)(4)J for specific standards related to electronic message centers.
         (Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1123.05 CALCULATION AND MEASUREMENTS.
   (a)   Sign Setback. All required setbacks for signs shall be measured as the
distance in feet from the applicable lot line, or other stated point of
measurement, to the closest point on the sign structure.
   (b)   Sign Height.
      (1)   The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the
base of the sign at normal grade (average grade at the base of the sign) to the
top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be
construed to be the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of
any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely undertaken for the purpose
of locating or increasing the height of sign.
      (2)   The filling of a hole or depression to create an average grade the
same level as that surrounding the hole or depression is permitted, provided
such filling is allowed by other ordinances.
      (3)   In cases where the normal grade is below grade at street level,
sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the
normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest
point of the crown of a public or private street. See Figure 1123-A.

Figure 1123-A: Illustration of the measurement of sign height when the grade at
the bottom of the sign is below the grade of the adjacent street.
   (c)   Sign Area. The surface of a sign to be included when computing maximum
allowable square footage of sign area shall be calculated as established in
this section. For the purposes of calculating sign area, one of the following
shapes may be used: circle, ellipse, triangle, square, rectangle, trapezoid,
pentagon or hexagon.
      (1)   The calculation of sign area shall not include any supporting
framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall unless such structural support
is determined to constitute an integral part of the sign design by means of
text or other commercial message, as determined by the Director of Community
Development. See Figure 1123-B.
      (2)   For sign copy mounted or painted on a background panel, cabinet or
surface that is distinctively painted, textured, lighted or constructed to
serve as the background for the sign copy, the sign area shall be computed by
means of the single smallest permitted shape that encompasses the extreme
limits of the background panel, cabinet or surface. See Figure 1123-B and
Figure 1123-C.

      (3)   For sign copy where individual letters or elements are mounted on a
building facade or window where there is no background panel, cabinet or
surface that is distinctively painted, textured, lighted or constructed to
serve as the background for the sign copy, the sign area shall be computed by
means of the single smallest permitted shape that encloses all of the letters
or elements associated with the sign. See Figure 1123-D.

individual letters.
      (4)   In cases where there are multiple elements of sign copy on the same
surface, any areas of sign copy that are within two (2) feet of one another
shall be calculated as a single sign area that shall be computed by means of
the smallest permitted shape that encloses all sign copy within two (2) feet of
one another, otherwise the sign area shall be computed for each separate piece
of sign copy. See Figure 1123-E.

on a window sign.
      (5)   When two identically sized, flat sign faces are placed back-to-back
with no more than twelve (12) inches in separation, so that both faces cannot
be viewed from any one point at the same time, the sign area shall be computed
by the measurement of one of the sign faces. The twelve (12)-inch separation
distance shall not apply in cases where the two (2) faces are part of a single
sign cabinet or structure that is fully enclosed. If the two (2) faces are
unequal, the sign area shall be calculated based on the larger of the two (2)
faces.
      (6)   In the case of a three-dimensional sign, where the sign faces are
not mounted back-to-back, the sign area shall be calculated by the single
smallest permitted shape that encompasses the profile of the sign message. The
profile used shall be the largest area of the sign message visible from any one
point.
         (Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)

   1123.09 TEMPORARY SIGNS.
   The following are the types of temporary signs allowed in the City of
Sharonville, including any applicable regulations for each type of sign.
   (a)   Standards Applicable to All Temporary Signs.
      (1)   Temporary signs shall not be mounted, attached, affixed, installed
or otherwise secured in a manner that will make the sign a permanent sign.
      (2)   No temporary sign shall be mounted, attached, affixed, installed or
otherwise secured so as to protrude above the roofline of a structure.
      (3)   All temporary signs shall be secured in such a manner as to prevent
swinging or other significantly noticeable movement resulting from the wind
that could pose a danger to people, vehicles or structures.
      (4)   Unless otherwise specifically stated, temporary signs shall not be
illuminated.
      (5)   No temporary sign shall require a foundation, support, wiring,
fittings, or elements that would traditionally require a building permit or
electrical permit.
      (6)   Temporary signs shall not be affixed to any permanent sign or
permanent structure except when a banner sign is permitted to cover a permanent
sign in accordance with this section or when such sign is attached to the
principal building as permitted in this chapter.
      (7)   No streamers, spinning, flashing, windblown devices or similarly
moving devices shall be allowed as part of, or attachments to, temporary signs.
      (8)   Where a temporary sign is designed to have two sign faces (portable
signs or temporary yard signs), such sign faces shall be of the same size and
mounted back-to-back. In the cases of an A-frame portable sign, the sign faces
shall be mounted back-to-back but may have an angular separation between faces
to form the A-frame shape.
      (9)   For certificate of zoning approval applications related to the
establishment of a new use or change of use within an existing building, where
there is existing permanent sign, a banner sign may be approved for up to sixty
(60) consecutive days to cover the existing permanent signs. Such banner sign
shall not exceed the sign area of the permanent sign and shall require a
certificate of zoning approval.
      (10)   Temporary signs shall be constructed of a material that is
substantial enough to withstand typical winds and weather for the duration of
the placement.
      (11)   Because of the nature of materials typically used to construct
temporary signs and to avoid the unsightliness of deteriorating signs and all
safety concerns which accompany such a condition, temporary signs shall be
removed or replaced when such a sign is deteriorated.
      (12)   Temporary signs shall not be located in the right-of-way. Where
the right-of-way is unknown, the temporary sign shall be set back a minimum of
ten (10) feet from the edge of any street pavement.
   (b)   Temporary Sign Allowances.
      (1)   Table 1123-3 establishes the allowances for temporary signs in all

            (Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1125.08 GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   General Suitability of Land for Development. If the Planning
Commission and the City Council find that land proposed to be subdivided is
unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding, poor drainage,
topography or inadequate water supply, wastewater treatment facilities,
transportation facilities, or such other conditions as may endanger health,
life or property, and if, from investigations conducted by the public agencies
concerned, it is determined that, in the best interest of the public, the land
should not be developed for the subdivision proposed, the Planning Commission
and the City Council shall not approve the land for the purpose unless adequate
methods are advanced by the subdivider for solving the problems that will be
created by the development of the land.
   (b)   Topography, Floodplain Areas, Wetlands, and Natural Areas.
      (1)   Natural amenities (including views, creeks, riparian corridors, and
similar features) shall be preserved and incorporated into proposed development
to the greatest extent feasible.
      (2)   All subdivisions of land and installation of public improvements
involving areas subject to flooding, as defined by National Flood Insurance
Program Maps and Data, shall conform to all applicable floodplain regulations
and the requirements of adopted regulations involving the City's participation
in the National Flood Insurance Program.
      (3)   Land which is determined by the Planning Commission to be
unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding, the presence of
Federal Jurisdiction Wetlands, or other features which will reasonably be
harmful to the safety, health and general welfare of the present or future
inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding areas shall not be
subdivided or developed unless methods adequate to resolve the problems are
formulated by the developer and approved by Council, upon recommendation by the
Planning Commission and upon advice of the Director of Community Development.
      (4)   The natural topography shall be retained wherever possible in order
to reduce excessive runoff onto adjoining property and to avoid extensive
regrading of the site.
      (5)   Floor elevations of all buildings shall be carefully studied in
relation to existing topography, proposed street grades, existing trees and
other pertinent site features.
   (c)   Subdivision Names. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not
duplicate or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other
subdivision in the City, Butler County, or Hamilton County. The City shall have
final authority to designate the name of the subdivision.
   (d)   Shade Trees. The Planning Commission is hereby authorized to require,
restrict or regulate the planting of trees within a public way, street or alley
in any new subdivision, prior to acceptance thereof by the Planning Commission.
The Planning Commission may require any and all such restrictions or
regulations to be made a part of the recorded plat for any and all new
subdivision plats presented for approval to such Planning Commission.
   (e)   Traffic Control Devices. The subdivider shall provide all traffic
control devices for the proposed development, including, but not limited to,
traffic signals, signs, pavement markings and the like. Refer to the Ohio
Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (OMUTC) for details of the devices to
be used, and, in some cases, warrants for their use.
   (f)   Debris and Waste. No cut trees, diseased trees, timber, debris, earth,
rocks, stones, soil, junk, rubbish or other waste materials of any kind shall
be buried in any land, or left or deposited on any lot or street at the time of
the zoning compliance inspection. No items and materials as described in the
preceding sentence shall be left or deposited in any area of the subdivision at
the time of dedication of public improvements.
   (g)   Cornerstones, Monuments, Markers and Pins.
      (1)   For the purpose of this section, the term "corner" shall be
considered any change in direction of a property line. Curved property lines
may be exempt from placement of permanent markers at all corners as determined
by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   At the time of surveying and laying out a subdivision, the
subdivider of a subdivision shall direct the surveyor to place and set at least
four permanent markers, one such marker to be located at each corner along the
perimeter of the subdivision. Additionally, one such marker shall be placed at
all corners of each interior lot. All permanent markers shall be placed in a
manner so that the line of sight between such markers can be observed from one
marker to the other.
      (3)   If the location for a permanent marker is originally determined to
be in an area of solid rock, it may be relocated and offset from its original
position. Such relocation must be noted on the plat.
      (4)   All permanent markers shall be made of either stone or concrete at
least four (4) inches in diameter, or four (4) inches square, and properly
marked. The markings on such markers shall consist of a crosscut with the legs
of the cross at least three inches long and at least one-eighth (1/8) inch
deep. All stone and concrete markers shall be at least thirty (30) inches long
and the bottom of such markers shall be set at least thirty (30) inches below
finished grade.
      (5)   All permanent markers shall be clearly designated on the plat
before it is presented to the Planning Commission for approval.
      (6)   Improvements shall not be accepted until the City Engineer has
verified in the field, that monuments, shown on the plat and certified by the
surveyor and/or engineer, have been placed.
         (Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1125.09 LOTS.
   (a)   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will
provide satisfactory building sites that can accommodate a structure and
required setbacks in the applicable zoning district. Lots shall also be
arranged so that all lots will have frontage on a public street or road and
will provide building sites properly related to topography and the character of
surrounding development.
   (b)   The lots shall be generally rectangular in form; triangular,
elongated, or other shapes that restrict its use as a building site shall be
avoided to the maximum extent feasible unless the applicant can demonstrate
special circumstances requiring irregular lots to the Planning Commission.
   (c)   All side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines and radial
to curved street lines except where the Planning Commission determines that a
variation to this rule will provide a better street and sublot layout.
   (d)   Lots shall be subject to the provisions of Section
1113.01(d)(3) and shall be of sufficient width to permit the required building
setbacks.
   (e)   Excessive length in relation to width shall be avoided.
   (f)   Every lot shall have access to it that is sufficient to afford a
reasonable means of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles as well as for
all those likely to need or desire access to the property in its intended use.
   (g)   Where compliance with the site development standards of Section
1113.01(d)(3) will result in a requirement for a greater lot area or width than
the standards set forth herein, the more restrictive requirement shall take
precedence and shall be required.
(Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1125.10 BLOCKS.
   (a)   The arrangement of blocks shall be such as to conform to the street
planning criteria set forth in Section
1125.13 and shall be arranged to accommodate lots and building sites of the
size and character required for the zoning district as set forth in this code.
   (b)   Subdivisions shall be designed with blocks of sufficient width to
permit two (2) tiers of lots of appropriate depth, except where an interior
street parallels a limited access highway, arterial street, or railroad right-
of-way.
   (c)   Irregularly shaped blocks, including superblocks, indented by cul-de-
sacs, containing interior parks or playgrounds and adequate parking spaces,
will be acceptable when properly designed and covered by agreements as to
maintenance of such park areas.
   (d)   Blocks shall have a maximum length of 1,800 feet. In reviewing the
subdivision plat, the Planning Commission can modify these requirements for
blocks that will be located adjacent to nonresidential uses or where there are
unusual topographic or natural features. Where a block is over 900 feet in
length, the Planning Commission may require a mid-block crosswalk.
   (e)   Blocks intended for business or industry shall be of such length as
may be considered most suitable for their prospective use, including adequate
provision for parking and deliveries.
   (f)   Where a subdivision adjoins a major thoroughfare, the block shall be
oriented so that there will be the fewest points of direct ingress and egress
along such major thoroughfare as possible.
   (g)   Irregularly shaped blocks, those intended for cul-de-sac or loop
streets, and those containing interior parks or playgrounds, may be approved if
properly designed and located, and if the maintenance of interior public spaces
is covered by agreements.
(Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1125.11 STREET LIGHTING.
   (a)   The developer shall pay the utility company all charges associated
with the installation of street lights in all subdivisions having underground
utilities. Street light pole standards and fixtures shall be selected by the
developer and approved by the Planning Commission during the major subdivision
review process. The selection of standards and fixtures are limited to those
units as listed in the street lighting contract. The rated lumens and the
locations of the standards and fixtures shall be determined by the City and the
utility company.
   (b)   Street lights shall be located at every intersection and at the neck
of every cul-de-sac. At other locations, street lights shall be located as
specified by the Planning Commission.
   (c)   The monthly costs for the street lighting units shall be borne by the
developer until these streets are accepted and dedicated by the City. Upon
acceptance and dedication, the City shall assume the monthly costs for street
lighting as part of its contract with the utility company.
(Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1125.12 PUBLIC OPEN SPACES AND SITES.
   (a)   Where, as indicated by the Comprehensive Plan or other adopted plans,
a proposed subdivision contains, wholly or in part, a proposed public open
space or a proposed site for a public building, the Planning Commission will
immediately notify the public authority concerned (City Council, Park Board,
Board of Education, etc.).
   (b)   If within thirty (30) days thereafter, the Planning Commission is not
advised that such property has been acquired by negotiation and agreement, or
within a second period of thirty (30) days after such notification that such
authority has commenced the necessary procedure to acquire such property by
appropriation, then the Planning Commission will not require that such open
space or site be reserved or included in the subdivision plats.
(Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1125.13 STREET DESIGN.
   (a)   General Street Design.
      (1)   The arrangement, character, width, grade, construction, and
location of all streets shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan, or other
approved plans, for the City that are in effect at the time of final plat
submission.
      (2)   The street layout shall provide access to all lots and parcels of
land within the subdivision.
      (3)   When a proposed development is adjacent to or contains a State
highway, the developer and the Planning Commission should seek information from
the Ohio Department of Transportation as to the status of such highway in
reference to width and direction and also to access of such highway.
      (4)   If a new subdivision involves frontage on a modified highway, the
street layout should be planned to avoid, as far as possible, any private
residential driveways from having direct access to such modified highway. In
such cases, access should be provided by means of a service roadway with motor
access at suitably spaced points.
      (5)   Access control at major arterials and highways shall be taken into
consideration in the design of the subdivision plat. The City or ODOT has the
right to define and limit access along major arterials or highways.
      (6)   The subdivider shall provide within the boundaries of the
subdivision plat the necessary right-of-way for the widening, continuance, or
alignment of such streets in conformity with the Comprehensive Plan or other
approved plans.
      (7)   The class of streets in a new subdivision shall be not less than
the minimum class established in this code. The street and alley arrangement
shall not cause a hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their
own land and seek to provide for convenient access to it.
      (8)   Residential local streets shall be designed to discourage through
traffic, but offset streets shall be avoided whenever possible.
      (9)   Where practical, the arrangement of streets in new subdivisions
shall make provision for the continuation of existing streets in adjoining
areas.
      (10)   Where adjoining areas are not subdivided or developed, the
arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the proper
projection of streets (i.e., provide for temporary dead-end streets where
street connections can be made to the adjacent land) as required by the
Planning Commission.
      (11)   A street that is not constructed to City standards will not be
accepted by the City for dedication as a public street.
      (12)   All streets shall have concrete combined curbs and gutters and
shall conform substantially to the Comprehensive Plan, or any other plans
adopted by the City.
      (13)   Whenever a tract to be subdivided includes any part of a street
indicated as a thoroughfare in a plan adopted by the City, such part of the
street shall be dedicated by the subdivider, except as provided in this
chapter. This required dedication shall also apply to the widening of existing
bordering streets except in cases where the proposed subdivision is limited to
a tier of lots fronting on such bordering street and where the subdivider owns
or controls no adjoining land beyond the rear line of such tier of lots. In no
case shall the required dedication exceed forty (40) feet in width as measured
from the centerline of the bordering street.
      (14)   If a street within a proposed subdivision has a recommended width
in excess of eighty (80) feet, the Planning Commission shall recommend to City
Council that such additional width be acquired by the City by purchase or
appropriation proceedings. If within a maximum of ninety (90) days thereafter,
City Council has not indicated its intention or proceeding with such
acquisition, either by passage of a resolution agreeing to purchase such
property at a price agreed to by the subdivider and City Council, or by the
passage of a resolution declaring its intent to appropriate such property to a
public use, then the recommendation by the Planning Commission for a width in
excess of eighty (80) feet shall not be used as grounds for disapproval of
either the improvement plans or plats.
      (15)   if City Council advises the Planning Commission prior to the
maximum time limits set out above that it has no intention of proceeding with
the desired acquisition, then the Planning Commission shall consider a design
for the subdivision which does not deny the immediate lawful use of the
property within such proposed right-of-way, but recognizes a possible future
acquisition of such right-of-way and provides accordingly for a minimum degree
of resultant disruption to the remaining streets and lots of the subdivision.
   
   (b)   Street Names, Signs, and Numbering.
      (1)   Street names shall be selected that will not duplicate or be
confused with the names of existing streets in the City of Sharonville and in
Hamilton or Buter Counties irrespective of modifying terms such as street,
avenue, boulevard, etc. Streets that are or will eventually be continuations of
existing or platted streets shall be named the same. Street names shall be
included on the preliminary plat and final plat.
      (2)   When a new street is a direct extension of an existing street, the
name shall remain the same.
      (3)   The developer, at their expense, shall install traffic control
devices within the subdivision and where subdivision streets connect with
existing streets in accordance with the recommendations of the traffic impact
study. These devices shall meet all applicable standard as established by the
City.
      (4)   Address numbers shall be assigned by the City in accordance with
the current numbering system.
   (c)   Angle of Intersection and Rounding of Property Corners.

collector streets shall not vary more than ten (10) degrees from a right angle.
All other streets shall intersect each other as near to a right angle as
possible.
      (2)   At the intersection of two streets, the corner of property lines
shall be rounded by a radius of not less than twelve and one-half (12.5) feet.
      (3)   All intersecting streets shall have a minimum curb or edge of
paving radius of twenty-five (25) feet.
      (4)   The minimum radius, noted above, shall be increased when the
smallest angle of intersection is less than sixty (60) degrees, or in any case
where the Planning Commission considers an increase necessary.
      (5)   At an intersection of alleys, a five (5)-foot chord shall cut off
each corner.
   (d)   Street Types.
      (1)   Street right-of-way widths and pavement widths shall comply with
the following:

this code, and such finding shall be made available to the decision-making body
prior to final action on the request.
         B.   When the records of the City document the publication, mailing,

      (2)   Continuance of a Public Hearing or Deferral of Application Review.
         A.   An applicant may request that a review board's consideration of
an application at a public hearing be deferred by submitting a written or
verbal request for deferral to the Director of Community Development prior to
the publication of notice, as may be required by this code. The Director of
Community Development may grant such requests, in which case, the application
will be considered at the next regularly scheduled meeting.
         B.   A request for deferral of consideration of an application
received by the Director of Community Development after publication of notice
of the public hearing, as required by this code, shall be considered as a
request for a continuance of the public hearing, and may only be granted by the
applicable review board.
         C.   The review board conducting the public hearing may, on its own

authorize only the particular development, alteration, construction, or use

affected by change in ownership provided there is no change in use and all
conditions of approval continue to be met.
   (o)   Modifications or Amendments of Approved Applications.
      (1)   For any review procedure, the Director of Community Development is
authorized to allow minor changes related to design of an approved application
where the change is insignificant and has minimal impact to the overall design
of the development or subdivision, does not increase density, or is necessary
to address minor technical issues. This shall not give the Director of
Community Development the authority to vary the requirements of this code or
any conditions of approval.
      (2)   Where the Director of Community Development determines that the
proposed modification, amendment, or change is not minor, as stated above, the
applicant shall be required to resubmit an application and payment of
additional fees for the application to be reviewed in accordance with the
procedures and standards established for its original approval.
   (p)   Reapplication after Denial of an Application. If an application is
denied, the applicant may:
      (1)   Appeal the decision in accordance with the applicable appeals
procedure established for the procedure in this code, or as granted by State
Law; or
      (2)   Make changes to the application that will fully address all issues
and findings identified for the denial and resubmit a new application,
including any required fees. Any such resubmission shall contain evidence that
shows how the new application has substantially changed to address each of the
findings of the original decision. The Director of Community Development shall
have the authority to determine if the evidence submitted substantially changes
the application to address all issues as part of the complete application
determination in
1129.02(d)(4). If it does not, the Director of Community Development shall
return the application, with reasons for their determination in writing, along
with any submitted fees;
      (3)   Submit the same application after a twenty-four (24)-month waiting
period; or
      (4)   Submit a new application if the proposed use and design of the site
will be entirely different than the denied application.
   (q)   Subsequent Development.
      (1)   Development authorized by any approval under this section and this
code shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other
approvals required by this code or any other applicable provisions of the
City's Codified Ordinances.
      (2)   The granting of any approval or permit shall not guarantee the
approval of any other required permit or application.
      (3)   The City shall not be responsible for reviewing the application for
compliance with any permits, certificates, or other approvals that may be
required by Hamilton or Butler County, as applicable, the State, or other
agencies having jurisdiction.
   (r)   Records. The City shall maintain permanent and current records of all
applications and the decisions related to those applications in City Hall.
   (s)   Computation of Time.
      (1)   In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this code,
the date of the application, act, decision, or event, from which the designated
period of time begins shall not be included. The last date of the period of
time to be computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a
legal holiday observed by the City of Sharonville where the City administrative
offices are closed for the entire day, in which case the period runs until the
end of the next day which is not a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday.
      (2)   When the period of time prescribed is less than seven (7) days,
intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded from the
computation (i.e., business days and not calendar days).
      (3)   When the City offices are closed to the public for the entire day
which constitutes the last day of the period of time, then such application,
act, decision, or event may be performed on the next succeeding day which is
not a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday observed by the City of
Sharonville in which the City administrative offices are closed for the entire
day.
      (4)   If a timeframe does not specify business or calendar days, such
timeframe shall be interpreted to be calendar days.

accordance with this code;
      (6)   The proposed use will be harmonious with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity, and such use will not change the essential
character of the same area;
      (7)   The conditional use will not be hazardous or disturbing to the
existing and future use and enjoyment of property in the immediate vicinity for
the uses permitted, nor substantially diminish or impair property values within
the neighborhood;
      (8)   The proposed use will not involve uses, activities, processes,
materials, equipment and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to
any person, property, or the general welfare by reason of excessive production
of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare, or odors;

      (13)   There is minimal potential for future hardship on the conditional
use that could result from the proposed use being surrounded by uses permitted
by right that may be incompatible; and
      (14)   Wherever there are no use-specific standards for the proposed use
related to street frontage, height, setbacks, or other lot and site
regulations, then such use shall be subject to the lot and site regulations for
the applicable zoning district.
   (e)   Additional Criteria and Conditions. The Planning Commission may impose
such conditions, guarantees, and safeguards as it deems necessary to protect
the general welfare and individual property rights, and to ensure that the
conditional use will meet the intent and purposes of this code.
   (f)   Revocation of a Conditional Use Permit Approval. The breach of any
condition, safeguard, or requirement shall automatically invalidate the
conditional use permit approval, and shall constitute a violation of this code.
Such violation shall be punishable as specified in Chapter
1133: Enforcement and Penalties.
   (g)   Time Limit.

   1129.05 MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purposes of the minor subdivision process are to allow
for small subdivisions of land, consolidation of lots, or transfers of a
portion of a lot to an adjacent lot where there will not be the creation of a
new street, dedication of right-of-way, or a need for any public improvements.
Such purposes are also intended to be in alignment with the platting allowances
established in ORC Chapter 711.
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   For the purposes of these regulations, a minor subdivision is a lot
split, lot consolidation, or transfer of land between adjacent property owners
that complies with all of the following requirements:
         A.   The subdivision shall not result in or create more than five (5)
lots, including the remainder of the original lot (e.g., four new lots and the
remainder of the original lot);
         B.   The subdivision shall be in compliance with all applicable site
development standards in this code or with any approved variance from such
standards;
         C.   All lots resulting from the minor subdivision shall have frontage
and access on an existing street and shall not require the construction,
expansion, or improvement of any street;

Section
1129.02: Common Review Requirements, and with the provisions of this section.
         B.   The application shall include a deed or other instrument of
conveyance in compliance containing an accurate and current legal description
based on a boundary survey, of each proposed new lot.
         C.   If the minor subdivision involves the transfer of land area from
one lot to an adjacent lot, both property owners shall be required to authorize
the application and instruments of conveyance shall be submitted for both
resulting lots.
      (2)   Step 2 - Review and Comment by Applicable Agencies.
         A.   Upon determination that the application for a minor subdivision

as applicable, to the Director of Community Development for consideration prior
to the Director of Community Development's decision (Step 3).
      (3)   Step 3 - Review and Decision by the Director of Community
Development.
         A.   Within fourteen (14) days of the determination that the
application (Step 1) is complete, or within an extended timeframe approved by
the applicant, the Director of Community Development shall review the
application and approve, approve with modifications that will bring the
application into compliance with codes, or deny the application for a minor
subdivision based on the review criteria established below. An extension on the
decision may be granted with approval from the applicant.
         B.   In reviewing the minor subdivision, the Director of Community
Development, on recommendation of the City Engineer, may require the addition
of easements and/or setbacks as part of a transfer of land area between two (2)
lots.
         C.   If the application is approved with modifications, the applicant
shall be required to revise all documents prior to final signing and recording.
         D.   If the Director of Community Development denies an application
for a minor subdivision, the Director of Community Development shall provide
the applicant with written finding for the denial.
      (4)   Step 4 - Recording.
         A.   If the application is approved, the Director of Community
Development shall sign and date all required deeds in the minor subdivision, or
other forms of conveyance allowed by the Hamilton or Butler County Auditor, as
applicable.
         B.   The applicant shall then be responsible for submitting the signed
conveyance to the Hamilton or Butler County Auditor, as applicable, for the
transfer of property and to the Hamilton or Butler County Recorder, as
applicable, for the recording of the lots as legal lots of record and providing
a copy of said conveyance to the Director of Community Development, after
recording.
         C.   In the case of a transfer of land between two (2) adjacent lots,
the recording of the revised lots shall take place simultaneously.
   
   (d)   Review Criteria. In order for a minor subdivision to be approved, the
Director of Community Development must determine the following:
      (1)   That the minor subdivision complies with all applicable provisions
of this code including, but not limited to, the lot and principal building
regulations of Section
1113.01;
      (2)   That the minor subdivision complies with all other applicable
regulations of the City; and
      (3)   That all valid objections to the minor subdivision raised by the
City departments have been or will be satisfactorily resolved by the applicant.
   (e)   Variances. If the proposed subdivision requires a deviation from the
minimum lot or principal building regulations (e.g., lot area, lot width, etc.)
or other standards mandated by this code in Section
1113.01, the applicant will be required to apply for and receive variance
approvals (See Section
1129.11.) prior to approval of the minor subdivision.
   (f)   Time Limit. The minor subdivision approval shall expire six (6) months
after the Director of Community Development signs and dates the minor
subdivision conveyance unless the minor subdivision is recorded in the office
of the Hamilton or Butler County Recorder, as applicable, during said period.
   (g)   Appeals. Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action with respect to the proposed minor subdivision shall have the

(Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1129.06 MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the major subdivision process is to provide a
method of review for any subdivision that exceeds the scope of a minor
subdivision.
   (b)   Applicability. Any subdivision of land or replat of an existing
subdivision that does not meet the applicability requirements of a minor
subdivision in Section
1129.05(b), shall be subject to the requirements of this section.
   (c)   Major Subdivision Review Procedure.
      (1)   Step 1 - Pre-Application Meeting (Optional). An applicant may
request to have a pre-application meeting with the Director of Community
Development and/or Planning Commission to informally discuss the application
and any concept plans. Such meeting shall be subject to Section
1129.02(f).
      (2)   Step 2 - Application and Filling of the Preliminary Plat.
         A.   The applicant shall submit an application, including a
preliminary plat, in accordance with Section
1129.02: Common Review Requirements, and with the provisions of this section.
         B.   The preliminary plat shall be prepared, signed, and sealed by an
engineer or surveyor who is qualified and registered in the State of Ohio.
      (3)   Step 3 - Administrative Staff Review and Transmission to the
Planning Commission.
         A.   Upon determination that the application for a preliminary plan is
complete, the Director of Community Development shall forward the application
to the PC and may transmit copies of the application for review by applicable
agencies including, but not limited to, the City Engineer and any other
agencies having authority over streets, water, sewer, gas, or other utilities
and other public improvements.
         B.   The Director of Community Development may consolidate any
comments from the public received in advance of the meeting and comments from
the Community Development Department or other departments and agencies into a
report for the PC to review as part of Step 4.
      (4)   Step 4 - Review and Decision on the Preliminary Plat by the
Planning Commission.
         A.   The Planning Commission shall review the preliminary plat
application at its next regularly scheduled meeting, or at a special meeting,
after the application is determined to be complete.
         B.   In making its decision, the Planning Commission shall approve,
approve with conditions, or deny the preliminary plat. The Planning Commission
may also continue the meeting if questions regarding the plat are not
satisfactorily addressed by the applicant.
         C.   The Planning Commission shall make a decision within sixty (60)
days of the filing of the preliminary plat (Step 2) unless the Planning
Commission and subdivider agree to an extension of this time frame. If the
Planning Commission fails to act within the sixty (60) days or there is no
agreement for an extension of time, the application for a preliminary plat will
be considered approved.
         D.   If the Planning Commission denies the preliminary plat, the
applicant shall not move forward in the review process until a preliminary plat
is approved by the Planning Commission.
         E.   In the event the Planning Commission denies the preliminary plat
or approves with conditions, the Director of Community Development, on behalf
of the Planning Commission shall provide the subdivider with a statement, in
writing, setting forth the reasons for the denial or the conditions of
approval.
         F.   If the applicant proposed to construct the subdivision in phases,
the Planning Commission may approve a timeframe for filing of improvement plans
and final plats for each phase.
         G.   Approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Commission does
not constitute approval of the subdivision, but is merely an authorization to
proceed with the preparation of the final plat and improvement plans.
      (5)   Step 5 - Submission of Improvement Plans and the Final Plat.
         A.   The applicant shall submit a final plat and related improvement
plans and specifications in accordance with Section
1129.02: Common Review Requirements. Such application shall take place within
three years following the Planning Commission's approval of the preliminary
plat unless the Planning Commission approved an alternative schedule, in which
case the applicant shall submit in accordance with the approved schedule.
Failure to submit the improvement plans within this time frame shall void the
preliminary plat approval and the subdivider will be required to submit a new
application in accordance with these regulations.
         B.   The applicant shall submit the improvement plans and
specifications in accordance with Section
1129.02: Common Review Requirements, and with the provisions of this section.
         C.   If a preliminary plat has been previously approved, the final
plat shall have incorporated all changes from the preliminary plat approval.
         D.   In cases where the applicant proposes to develop the subdivision
in phases, the final plat and improvement plans shall be submitted for each
individual phase.
         E.   If the applicant proposes to provide a financial guarantee for
the public improvements in lieu of installing all public improvements prior to
approval of the final plat, the applicant shall be required to provide all
information required as part of Section
1125.07.
         F.   Upon determination by the Director of Community Development that
the final plat has been properly submitted, the final plat shall be accepted as
being filed.
         G.   The final plat shall be prepared, signed, and sealed by an
engineer or surveyor who is qualified and registered in the State of Ohio.
      (6)   Step 6 - Administrative Staff Review of the Final Plat and
Improvement Plans.
         A.   Upon determination that the submission of the final plat and
improvement plans is complete, the Director of Community Development may
transmit copies of the application for review by applicable agencies including,
but not limited to, the City Engineer and any other agencies having authority
over streets, water, sewer, gas, or other utilities and other public
improvements.
         B.   Such agencies shall supply comments and recommendations to the
Director of Community Development prior to the regularly scheduled Planning
Commission meeting where the final plat and improvement plans will be subject
to review.
         C.   Construction of Improvements.
            i.   Applicants shall have the choice to construct all public
improvements prior to the approval of the final plat, without a financial
guarantee, but such public improvements must be completed and then inspected
and approved by the City Engineer before the City can approve the final plat.
The improvements shall be constructed within a reasonable time as determined by
the City Engineer.
            ii.   All required subdivision improvements shall be maintained in
a satisfactory condition by the subdivider during any interim period between
their construction and final approval and acceptance of the subdivision by the
City. Additionally, such improvements shall be subject to maintenance
requirements following acceptance in accordance with this section and Chapter
1125: Subdivision Design.
            iii.   If the applicant requests approval of a final plat prior to
installation of the public improvements, the applicant shall be required to
provide a financial guarantee in accordance with the regulations of this code
at the time the final plat is submitted for review.
      (7)   Step 7 - Review and Decision on the Final Plat and Improvement
Plans by the Planning Commission.
         A.   The Planning Commission shall review the final plat and
improvement plans at its next regularly scheduled meeting, or at a special
meeting, after the final plat is submitted and determined to be complete.
         B.   The Planning Commission shall approve, approve with conditions,
or deny the improvement plans and final plat. The Planning Commission may also
continue the meeting if questions regarding the plat are not satisfactorily
answered by the applicant.
         C.   The Planning Commission shall make a decision within thirty (30)
days of the filing of the final plat and improvement plans (Step 5) unless the
Planning Commission and subdivider agree to an extension of this time frame. If
the Planning Commission fails to act within the thirty (30) days or there is no
agreement for an extension of time, the application for a final plat will be
considered approved.
         D.   If the Planning Commission denies the final plat and/or
improvement plans, the applicant shall not move forward in the review process
until a final plat and the improvement plans are approved by the Planning
Commission.
         E.   In the event the Planning Commission denies the final plat and
improvement plans or approves with conditions, the Planning Commission shall
provide the subdivider with a statement, in writing, setting forth the reasons
for the denial or the conditions of approval.
         F.   Approval of the final plat and improvement plans by the Planning
Commission shall not be an acceptance by the public of the offer of dedication
of any street, or other public ways or open space on the final plat unless they
are accepted by City Council in the form of the adoption of an ordinance.
         G.   The final plat shall be held until acceptance of all improvements
in Step 8. No final plat shall be recorded until all improvements and areas
offered for parks, open space, or public rights-of-way have been accepted by
City Council.
         H.   At the completion of construction, and before acceptance of the
public improvements, the developer shall furnish the City a set of record or
"as-built" reproducible drawings as well as a digital copy that is compatible
with the City Engineer's software showing the locations of all public
improvements including the sizes and elevations of all underground utilities.
      (8)   Step 8 - Acceptance of Improvements by City Council. The City,
through action by the City Council, shall review the final plat and consider
acceptance of public improvements made by a subdivider only after meeting the
following conditions:
         A.   The public improvements have been made in accordance with the
requirements of this code, and any other manuals or documents referenced in
Section
1125.03;
         B.   Installation of the public improvements has been completed in
accordance with the applicable design standards;
         C.   All final inspections required by these regulations and the City
have been carried out by the City, and said public improvements were found to
be acceptable by the City Engineer.
         D.   After all public improvements have been installed to the
satisfaction of the City, the subdivider shall submit an original copy of as-
built improvement plans (showing how all public improvements were actually
installed) to the City Engineer in a format acceptable to the City Engineer.
         E.   After all public improvements have been installed in accordance
with the subdivision approvals and these regulations, and the subdivider has
complied with this section, the City Council may, by ordinance, accept the
public improvements for maintenance with any applicable financial guarantee.
      (9)   Step 9 - Disposition of Approved Plat and Recordation.
         A.   All required deeds, agreements, and other required legal
instruments shall be submitted to the Director of Community Development within
sixty (60) days from the date of the Planning Commission's approval or such
approval shall thereafter be rendered null and void.
         B.   Any recorded plat which has not been approved according to the
regulations in this chapter shall be considered invalid.
         C.   The subdivider shall then be responsible for submitting the
signed plat to the Hamilton or Butler County Recorder, as applicable, for the
recording of the lots as legal lots of record and providing a copy of said plat
to the City after recording.
         D.   The approval of a plat shall expire within 120 days after City
Council approval is effective unless the plat has been duly filed and recorded
by the applicant as required by law, and the original tracing of the plat has
been filed with the Director of Community Development.
   (d)   Review Criteria. In order to approve a major subdivision, the Planning
Commission shall determine the following:
      (1)   That the major subdivision complies with all applicable provisions
of this code;
      (2)   That the major subdivision does not conflict with other
regulations, plans, or policies of the City;
      (3)   That the proposed subdivision is designed to be harmonious with the
existing immediate or surrounding area or is in keeping with the intended
character of such area;
      (4)   That the proposed streets are in accordance with approved plans and
have been coordinated with existing streets, and that adequate measures have
been taken to provide ingress and egress so as to minimize traffic congestion
in public streets;
      (5)   That the proposed subdivision will not adversely affect the
delivery of governmental services;
      (6)   That applicable review agencies have no objections that cannot be
resolved by the applicant; and
      (7)   That the final plat and improvement plans conform to the approved
preliminary plat, if submitted and approved.
   (e)   Amendments of Application.
      (1)   No changes, erasures, modifications, or revisions shall be made in
any plat of a subdivision after final approval has been given by the Planning
Commission and an endorsement is made in writing on the plat, unless the plat
is first resubmitted and the changes approved by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   If the applicant finds, in the process of preparing improvement
plans, that the approved preliminary plat, if submitted, is not workable and
changes in layout are required, the applicant shall inform the City Engineer.
The City Engineer may require that a revised preliminary plat be submitted for
re-approval following the review procedure in Section
1129.06(c)(4), above, if the changes significantly alter the design of the
subdivision, including changes to the number of lots, modification of street
layouts, or other substantial changes. If the proposed changes are technical or
minor and do not substantively alter the approved preliminary plat, the City
Engineer may approve the revisions. Failure to submit and receive approval of a
revised preliminary plat shall void approval of the preliminary plat and any
new submission shall be subject to a new application. 
      (3)   During the final plat process, the City Engineer is authorized to
allow minor changes related to the public improvements or design where there is
minimal impact to the overall design of the subdivision. This limited authority
shall not give the City Engineer the authority to vary the requirements of this
code.
      (4)   If during the course of construction, any changes or modifications
are encountered that are not in conformance with the original approved
improvement plans, the subdivider shall submit the modified improvement plans
(which have now become as-built drawings) to the City Engineer, who, if in
agreement with such modifications, shall sign these drawings to indicate
approval of the modifications. If the City Engineer does not approve the
modifications, the applicant shall be required to bring the improvements into
compliance with the approved improvement plans or the City may utilize the
financial guarantee to correct the issue.
   (f)   Subdivision Modifications.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of a subdivision modification is to provide
limited relief from standards that apply to the subdivision of land, including
standards for improvements. Subdivision modifications are intended for those
cases where strict application of a particular requirement will create a
practical difficulty or extraordinary hardship prohibiting the use of land in a
manner otherwise allowed under these regulations. It is not intended that
modifications be approved merely to remove inconveniences or financial burdens
that the requirements of these regulations may impose on property owners or
subdividers in general.
      (2)   Applicability.
         A.   If the proposed subdivision requires a deviation from the minimum
lot and principal building regulations (e.g., lot area, lot width, etc.) or
other standards identified in Section
1113.01, the applicant will be required to apply for and receive all the
necessary variance approvals (See Section
1129.11.) prior to approval of a preliminary plat.
         B.   If the applicant seeks a modification of standards required by
Chapter
1125: Subdivision Design, then the request for a modification shall be
accomplished through the procedure outlined in this section.
      (3)   Subdivision Modification Review.
         A.   A request for a subdivision modification shall be reviewed as
part of the preliminary plat review procedure.
         B.   In reviewing the application, the Planning Commission shall, at a
minimum, consider the review criteria of this section.
         C.   The Planning Commission shall review the request and may approve,
approve with conditions, or deny the request to modify any or all of the
requested modifications.
         D.   In approving a modification, the Planning Commission may impose
conditions on the approval as it determines are required to ensure compliance
with the provisions and purposes of these regulations.
         E.   If the preliminary plat is denied or if the approval of the
preliminary plat expires, so does the approval of the subdivision modification.
Any future request for preliminary plat approval that includes the same
modifications shall require a new review and decision on the request for
modifications.
      (4)   Review Criteria. The review criteria for a subdivision modification
shall be the same as those for a variance as established in Section
1129.11(c).
   (g)   Appeals. Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action of the Planning Commission shall have the right to appeal the
decision to the court of common pleas of the applicable county, as provided in
ORC Chapters 2505 and 2506.
(Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1129.07 SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)   Purpose. Certain land uses are quite necessary to the proper
development of a community, but likewise possess characteristics which warrant
special treatment. These characteristics, in many situations, can easily become
undesirable to some degree, basically because their intrinsic needs and/or
appearance have a wide-ranging influence beyond their own perimeter. In
conformance with the purposes of this code, it is hereby deemed prudent and
necessary to apply limits and guidelines which shall both encourage good
development and discourage undesirable effects on surrounding development.
   (b)   Applicability. The following forms of development shall require site
plan review by the Planning Commission in accordance with this section:
      (1)   New construction, structural alterations, and site improvements in
the R2-C, RM-D, PF, OB, LB, GB, CBD, CS, GI, ITC, and PUD Districts, unless
waived by the Director of Community Development for the following reasons:
         A.   The construction is an addition or alteration to an existing
building that includes less than fifty percent (50%) of the entire building
gross floor area prior to construction and will not alter the any building
facade facing a street;
         B.   Minor changes to vehicular use area or landscaping requirements,
as determined by the Director of Community Development; or
         C.   Other changes that are minor or technical in nature and will not
alter the use or change the exterior appearance of buildings.
      (2)   New construction, structural alterations, and site improvements in
the NLO District, regardless of the underlying zoning district;
      (3)   All conditional uses, in all zoning districts;
      (4)   Any proposal to alter, reconstruct, or otherwise modify any
existing or previously approved site plan for a permitted use, conditional use,
or similar use that increases the number of dwelling units in a multi-family
development, or that changes the use in a manner which requires an increase in
the amount of parking or a change in the site's circulation.
      (5)   Exemptions.  The following forms of development within the above
zoning districts shall be exempt from site plan review but may still be subject
to certificate of zoning approval review:
         A.   Single-family dwellings; and
         B.   Re-occupancy of an existing building or the internal construction
or change in floor area of a building or structure that does not increase the
gross floor area, increase the intensity of use, or affect parking or
landscaping requirements on a site that meets all of the development standards
of this code; and
         C.   Accessory and temporary uses as established in Chapter
1111: Accessory and Temporary Uses, unless otherwise stated.
   (c)   Site Plan Review Procedure. The site review procedures shall proceed
as follows:
      (1)   Step 1 - Pre-Application Meeting (Optional). An applicant may
request to have a pre-application meeting with the Director of Community
Development and/or Planning Commission to informally discuss the application
and any concept plans. Such meeting shall be subject to Section

comments from the public received in advance of the meeting and comments from
the Community Development Department or other departments and agencies into a
report for the PC to review as part of Step 4.
      (4)   Step 4 - Planning Commission Review and Decision.
         A.   The Planning Commission shall review the site plan application at
its next regularly scheduled meeting, or at a special meeting, after the

         E.   After approval of a site plan, the applicant may apply for a
certificate of zoning approval.
   (d)   Review Criteria. The following standards shall be utilized by the
Planning Commission in the review of all site plans. These standards are
intended to provide a frame of reference for the applicant in the preparation
of the site plans as well as for the reviewing authority in making a judgment
concerning them. These standards shall not be regarded as inflexible

enclosure of space in conjunction with other existing buildings or other
proposed buildings and the creation of focal points with respect to avenues of
approach, terrain features or other buildings;
      (6)   The development will preserve and be sensitive to the natural
characteristics of the site in a manner that complies with the applicable
regulations set forth in this code;

completion of each stage.
   (e)   Modifications.
      (1)   Major changes such as increased density, additional buildings,
etc., to the approved final site plan shall require a new submission for site
plan approval.
      (2)   Any minor changes, such as dimension changes, building location,
parking and drives, etc. may be approved by the Director of Community
Development provided they do not create substantive changes to the elements of
the site plan.
      (3)   No changes are to be considered as a waiver of conditions or
covenants, and all rights to enforce such conditions or covenants against any
changes permitted by this code are expressly reserved.
   
   (f)   Significance of an Approved Site Plan.
      (1)   An approved site plan shall become, for the proposed development, a
binding commitment of the specific elements approved for development,
regardless if the ownership of the site is transferred.
      (2)   All construction and development under any certificate of zoning
approval and building permit shall be in accordance with the approved site
plan. Any departure from such plan shall be cause for revocation of the

(Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1129.08 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS (COA).
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the COA is to provide a procedure by which to
review construction, renovation, expansion, and demolition projects within a
locally or nationally designated historic district or for locally or nationally
designated historic properties. In an effort to preserve the character of these
properties and districts, the City has established reasonable development
standards and design guidelines for buildings and structures, and this
procedure allows for a comprehensive review of the activities against the
adopted standards and guidelines.
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   No person shall make any exterior construction, reconstruction,
alteration, or demolition of a structure exceeding 150 square feet in floor
area on any property within a locally or nationally designated historic
district or on a locally or nationally designated historic property or
contributing building unless a COA has been approved by the Planning Commission
and a certificate of zoning approval, if required, has also been issued.
      (2)   Site improvements, such as the establishment of a parking lot,
landscaping, or other site work, or any changes to components of a property not
specifically identified by the ordinance that applies to the historic district
or property, shall not require a COA.
      (3)   Projects and activities that are exempt from the COA review
procedure include:
         A.   The reconstruction, alteration or demolition of a structure or
feature which has been ordered by the Building Official upon certification of
an unsafe condition constituting an emergency;

exterior elevations or facade of the building or structure or any architectural
features that are visible from the outside.
   (c)   COA Review Procedure. The review procedure for a COA shall be as
follows:
      (1)   Step 1 - Pre-Application Meeting (Optional). An applicant may

      (2)   Step 2 - Application.
         A.   The applicant shall submit an application in accordance with
Section
1129.02: Common Review Requirements, and with the provisions of this section.
         B.   In making application, the Director of Community Development or
the Planning Commission may request that the applicant provide exhibits,
sketches, examples of materials, renderings, or other documentation to assist
in their decision.
      (3)   Step 3 - Administrative Staff Review. Upon determination that a COA
application is complete, the Director of Community Development shall refer the
application to the Planning Commission.

criteria of this section.
         C.   Notification of the public meeting shall be provided in
accordance with Section
1129.02(i).
         D.   Within forty-five (45) days after the COA application is
determined to be complete, or an extended timeframe approved by the applicant,
the Planning Commission shall hold a public meeting to review the application
and make a decision on the application. In making its decision, the Planning
Commission may approve, approve with modifications, or deny the application.
The Planning Commission shall make every effort to work with the applicant
within this time period to develop a proposal that the Planning Commission can
approve or approve with modifications.
         E.   The time period shall be extended to sixty (60) days from a
public hearing, if the Planning Commission is required to hold a hearing to
undertake an alternative equivalency review (See Section
1129.10.).
         F.   If a COA is denied, the City shall not issue any permits that
would allow modifications for which the COA was denied. In cases where the
Planning Commission has denied a COA, the Planning Commission shall state the
reasons for such disapproval in writing and transmit the written statement to
the applicant together with any recommendation the Planning Commission may have
made for appropriate changes.
         G.   If the Planning Commission fails to make a recommendation within
the established timeframe, or an extended timeframe approved by the applicant,
the application shall be deemed denied.
         H.   If a certificate of zoning approval is required for the subject
work, the applicant may proceed with applying for the certificate of zoning
approval following approval of the COA. Such certificate of zoning approval
applications shall comply with the COA approval and any related modifications.
   (d)   Determining the Significance of a Structure.
      (1)   When making decisions or recommendations about changes to

historically or architecturally significant, the Planning Commission may relax
or waive the standards or guidelines that apply to the project.
      (3)   If the Planning Commission finds that the structure is historically
or architecturally significant, the standards and guidelines of this code shall
be fully applied as determined by the Planning Commission.
      (4)   The Planning Commission shall determine whether a structure or site
is significant based on the structure's:
         A.   Value as a reminder of the cultural, historical, or
archaeological heritage of the City, State, or nation;
         B.   Location as a site of a significant local, State, or national
event;
         C.   Identification with a person or persons who significantly
contributed to the development of the City, State, or nation;
         D.   Identification as the work of a master builder, designer, or
architect whose individual work has influenced the City, State, or nation;
         E.   Value as a building that is recognized for the quality of its
architecture and that it retains sufficient elements showing such architectural
significance;
         F.   Example of an architectural style or period; and/or
         G.   Character as a contributing element in a locally or nationally
designated historic district.
   (e)   Review Criteria. Decisions on a COA application shall be based on
consideration of the following criteria:
      (1)   The proposed development is in compliance with all the requirements
of this code and other related codes and ordinances enforced by the City;
      (2)   The proposed development incorporates any applicable standards or
guidelines (See Section
1115.03.), to the maximum extent feasible;
      (3)   The proposed development meets all the requirements or conditions
of any applicable development approvals (e.g., PUD approvals, conditional use
approvals, variance approvals, etc.); and
      (4)   There is no feasible and prudent alternative alteration or change
which would conform to the guidelines, and adhering to the guidelines would
deny the owner a reasonable rate of return on the real property or amount to a
taking of property without just compensation.
   (f)   Time Limit.
      (1)   The applicant shall submit a completed application for a
certificate of zoning approval within one year of the date that the COA was
approved or the approval shall expire. The date of approval shall be the date
the Director of Community Development issues the COA.
      (2)   Upon expiration of a COA, a new application, including all
applicable fees, shall be required before a new application will be reviewed.
      (3)   Upon written request, one extension of one year may be granted by
the Director of Community Development if the applicant can show good cause for
a delay.
      (4)   The Planning Commission may authorize alternative time limits for
certificate of zoning approval issuance based on the scale of the proposed
development.
   (g)   Appeals. Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action of the Planning Commission shall have the right to appeal the
decision to the court of common pleas of the applicable county, as provided in
ORC Chapters 2505 and 2506.
(Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1129.09 DESIGNATION OF HISTORIC LANDMARKS AND HISTORIC DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this designation procedure is to provide a
clear method by which certain sites, buildings, and larger districts are
considered for formal designation as a historic landmark, contributing
building, historic site, or historic district within the City of Sharonville,
subject to enhanced review to ensure that the sites, structures, buildings, or

   1129.10 ALTERNATIVE EQUIVALENCY REVIEW.
   (a)   Purpose. The alternative equivalency review is a procedure that allows
applicants to propose a unique design option as an alternative to a development
standard established in this code, provided it meets or exceeds the intent of
the design-related provisions of this code. It is not a variance, waiver, or
weakening of regulations. Rather, this procedure permits a site-specific plan
that is equal to or better than the strict application of a design standard
specified in this code. An alternative equivalency review approval shall apply
only to the specific site for which it is requested and does not establish a
precedent for assured approval of other requests.
   (b)   Applicability. The alternative equivalency review procedure shall be
available only for the following sections of this code:
      (1)   Section
1113.03: Outdoor Lighting;
      (2)   Chapter
1117: Architectural Standards;
      (3)   Chapter
1119: Landscaping and Screening;
      (4)   Chapter
1121: Parking, Access, and Connectivity;
      (5)   Any design standards or guidelines that apply to a landmark or
landmark district.
   (c)   Review Timing. An alternative equivalency review shall be made
concurrently with a site plan review or a COA application, whichever is
applicable. If the applicant is not required to submit for a site plan or COA
approval, then the application for review shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission for review in accordance with this section.
   (d)   Alternative Equivalency Review Procedure. The review procedure for any
alternative equivalency review application shall be as follows:
      (1)   Step 1 - Application. The applicant shall submit an application in
accordance with Section
1129.02: Common Review Requirements, and with the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Step 2 - Administrative Staff Review and Transmission to the
Planning Commission.
         A.   Upon determination that an alternative equivalency review
application is complete, the Director of Community Development shall distribute
the application to all appropriate City departments and professional
consultants for review and comment. Any comments or expert opinions shall be
returned to the Director of Community Development for transmission to the
Planning Commission.
         B.   The Director of Community Development shall distribute the
application and any reports to the applicable board prior to the hearing where
the application is to be reviewed.
      (3)   Step 3 - Planning Commission Review and Decision.
         A.   Within forty-five (45) days after the application is determined
to be complete, or an extended timeframe approved by the applicant, the
Planning Commission shall review the application at a public hearing.
         B.   Notification of the public hearing shall be provided in
accordance with Section
1129.02(j).
         C.   In reviewing the application, the Planning Commission shall, at a
minimum, consider the reports and opinions transmitted by the Director of
Community Development and the review criteria of this section.
         D.   The Planning Commission shall make a decision on the application.
In making its decision, the Planning Commission may approve, approve with
modifications or supplementary conditions, or deny the application.
         E.   If the Planning Commission fails to act within thirty (30) days
after close of the public hearing, or an extended period as may be agreed upon
by the applicable board, and applicant, then the application shall be
considered denied.
         F.   If approved, any certificate of zoning approval, development
plan, COA, or other related applications shall demonstrate compliance with the
alternative equivalency review approval.
   (e)   Review Criteria. Decisions on an alternative equivalency review
application shall be based on consideration of the following criteria:
      (1)   That the proposed alternative achieves the intent of the subject
design or development standard to the same or better degree than the subject
standard;
      (2)   That the proposed alternative achieves the goals and policies of
the Comprehensive Plan to the same or better degree than the subject standard;
      (3)   That the proposed alternative results in benefits to the community
that are equivalent to or better than compliance with the subject standard; and
      (4)   That the proposed alternative imposes no greater impacts on
adjacent properties than would occur through compliance with the specific
requirements of this code.
   (f)   Conditions. The Planning Commission may impose conditions on an
approval for an alternative equivalency review, provided such conditions are
related to ensuring the performance of the alternative equivalency review to
meet or exceed the subject standard. Such conditions may include required
timeframes, amendments or revisions to the proposal, or the ability to revoke
an approval for an alternative equivalency review.
   (g)   Decisions. Any decision on an alternative equivalency review
application shall not be binding on the City related to future applications
requesting an alternative to any of the applicable standards. Each case shall
be reviewed and decided upon based on the individual circumstances.
   (h)   Time Limit.
      (1)   An approval of an alternative equivalency review application shall
expire if the certificate of zoning approval or COA, as applicable, expires.
      (2)   Upon expiration of an alternative equivalency review approval, a
new application, including all applicable fees, shall be required before a new
application will be reviewed.
   (i)   Appeals. Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action of the Planning Commission shall have the right to appeal the
decision to the court of common pleas of the applicable county, as provided in
ORC Chapters 2505 and 2506.
(Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1129.11 VARIANCES.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of a variance is to provide limited relief from
the requirements of this code in those cases where strict application of a
particular requirement will create a practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship prohibiting the use of land in a manner otherwise allowed under this
code. It is not intended that a variance be granted merely to remove
inconveniences or financial burdens that the requirements of this code may
impose on property owners in general. Variances are intended to address
extraordinary, exceptional, or unique situations that were not caused by the
applicant's act or omission.
   (b)   Variance Review Procedure. The review procedure for a variance shall
be as follows:
      (1)   Step 1 - Application. The applicant shall submit an application in
accordance with Section
1129.02: Common Review Requirements, and with the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Step 2 - Administrative Staff Review.
         A.   Upon determination that a variance application is complete, the
Director of Community Development shall distribute the application, and all
related plans, to applicable City departments for internal review.
         B.   The Director of Community Development will provide a summary of
comments received from the City departments.
         C.   Upon receipt of comments, the applicant shall have the option to
make revisions to the application and plans based on the comments prior to the
application and plans being forwarded to the BZA, or the applicant may request
that the application be forwarded to the BZA without revisions.
      (3)   Step 3 - BZA Review and Decision.
         A.   The BZA shall hold a public hearing within sixty (60) days of the
filing of the variance application being determined complete, provided adequate
notification is provided pursuant to Section
1129.02(j).
         B.   In reviewing the application, the BZA shall, at a minimum,
consider the review criteria of this section.
         C.   The BZA may request that the applicant supply additional
information that the BZA deems necessary to review and evaluate the request for
a variance.
         D.   Within thirty (30) days of the close of the public hearing, or an
extended timeframe approved by the applicant, the BZA shall render a decision.
In making its decision, the BZA may approve, approve with modifications or
supplementary conditions, or deny the application.
         E.   In making its decision, the BZA shall make specific findings of
fact, based directly on the particular evidence presented. The findings of fact
shall state that the reasons set forth in the application and as presented by
the applicant during the public hearing justify either:
            i.   Approval of the application;
            ii.   Approval with modifications or supplementary conditions; or
            iii.   Denial of the variance application. In approving any
variance, the BZA must find that such approval will make possible a reasonable
use of the land, building, or structure.
         F.   The Director of Community Development shall notify the applicant,
in writing, of the decision of the BZA.
         G.   If the BZA fails to make a recommendation within the established
timeframe, or an extended timeframe approved by the applicant, the application
shall be deemed denied.
         H.   The decision of the BZA shall become effective immediately.
         I.   In approving a variance, the BZA may impose conditions on the
approval, the proposed use, and the premises to be developed or used pursuant
to such approval as it determines are required to be ensure compliance with the
standards of this section and the purposes of this code. Any conditions
established by the BZA shall relate directly to the requested variance.
         J.   Any violation of the conditions of approval shall be a violation
of this code, subject to the enforcement and penalties of Chapter
1133: Enforcement and Penalties.
   (c)   Review Criteria.
      (1)   Area or Dimensional Variance. Where an applicant is seeking an area
or dimensional variance, the following factors shall be considered and weighed
by the BZA to determine if a practical difficulty exists that would justify
approval of the variance. However, no single factor listed below may control,
and not all factors may be applicable in each case. Each case shall be
determined on its own facts. The application for a variance shall not be based
exclusively upon a desire to increase the value or income potential of the
parcel of land or any structures or uses thereupon. The BZA shall take into
consideration:
         A.   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district. Examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are exceptional irregularity,
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot, or proximity to nonconforming
and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions;
         B.   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return
or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
         C.   Whether the variance is the minimum necessary to make possible
the reasonable use of the land or structures;
         D.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
         E.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, or trash pickup;
         F.   Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the applicant (actions of the applicant shall not include the
purchase or acquisition of the property);
         G.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
         H.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance;
         I.   Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; and
         J.   Whether a literal interpretation of the provisions of this code
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this code.
      (2)   Use Variance. In order to grant a use variance, the BZA shall
determine that strict compliance with the terms of this code will result in
unnecessary hardship to the applicant. The applicant must demonstrate such
hardship by clear and convincing evidence that all of the following criteria
are satisfied:
         A.   The property cannot be put to any economically viable use under
any of the permitted uses in the zoning district in which the property is
located;
         B.   The variance requested stems from a condition which is unique to
the property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zone or district;
         C.   The hardship condition is not created by actions of the applicant
(actions of the applicant shall not include the purchase or acquisition of the
property);
         D.   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights
of adjacent property owners or residents;
         E.   There is an existing building on the lot and such building, due
to its design, cannot be reasonably reused for a permitted use in the district;
         F.   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public
health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity or general welfare;
         G.   The variance will be consistent with the general spirit and
intent of this code; and
         H.   The variance sought is the minimum that will afford relief to the
applicant.
   (d)   Time Limit.
      (1)   The applicant shall submit a completed application for a
certificate of zoning approval and start work within one year of the date the
variance was approved or the approval shall expire.
      (2)   Upon expiration of a variance approval, a new application,
including all applicable fees, shall be required before a variance application
will be reviewed.
      (3)   Upon written request, one extension of six months may be granted by
the Director of Community Development if the applicant can show good cause for
a delay.
      (4)   As part of the variance approval, the BZA may authorize alternative
time limits for certificate of zoning approval issuance based on the scale of
the proposed development.
   (e)   Appeals. Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action of the BZA shall have the right to appeal the decision to the
court of common pleas of the applicable county, as provided in ORC Chapters
2505 and 2506.
(Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1129.12 CERTIFICATE OF ZONING APPROVAL.
   (a)   Purpose. A certificate of zoning approval shall be required in
accordance with the provisions of this section in order to ensure that proposed
development and uses comply with the standards of this code, and to otherwise
protect the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general
welfare of the citizens of the City of Sharonville.
   (b)   Terminology.
      (1)   For the purposes of this code, the certificate of zoning approval
review shall be an administrative review that may be applied to permits or
certificates of other names (e.g., sign permits, temporary use permits, fence
permits, etc.) if so stated in this code or on the application for the permit
or certificate. In such cases, the procedure of Section
1129.12(d), below, shall still apply, including the applicability of
administrative waiver requests.
      (2)   Where a building permit is required for any proposed construction,
alteration, or other change, the certificate of zoning approval may be reviewed
as a component of the building permit and not necessarily as a stand-alone
certificate.
   (c)   Applicability.
      (1)   No building or other structure shall be erected, moved,
structurally altered, or added to, in whole or in part, nor shall any building,
structure, or land be used or changed in use without a certificate of zoning
approval issued by the Director of Community Development. A change in tenancy
or ownership of a residential dwelling unit shall be exempt from the
certificate of zoning approval requirement unless such change in tenancy
changes the classification of the use.
      (2)   A certificate of zoning approval may be required for the
establishment of certain temporary or accessory use as established in Chapter
1111: Accessory and Temporary Uses.
      (3)   A certificate of zoning approval shall be required for any changes
to any site element, vehicular use area, landscaping, patio, or other
improvements to land as may be established under the applicability sections of
individual sections or chapters in this code.
      (4)   The establishment of a use of vacant land or building shall require
the issuance of a certificate of zoning approval.
      (5)   A change in use or business establishment shall require a
certificate of zoning approval. This shall not apply to a change in tenancy of
a residential dwelling unit.
      (6)   Changes in a building or structure's appearance that is regulated
by this code shall require a certificate of zoning approval unless the change
is a replacement of the same-for-same materials and colors, etc.
      (7)   Unless otherwise specifically exempted in Chapter
1123: Signs, signs shall require a certificate of zoning approval.
      (8)   Certificates of zoning approval shall be issued only in conformity
with the provisions of this code unless the application is subject to an
approval by the BZA or Planning Commission providing for additional standards,
conditions, or modifications, in which case, the certificate of zoning approval
shall be issued in conformity with the provisions of those approvals, as
applicable.
      (9)   Failure to obtain a certificate of zoning approval shall be a
violation of this code subject to the provisions of Chapter
1133: Enforcement and Penalties.
   (d)   Certificate of Zoning Approval Review Procedure. The review procedure
for a certificate of zoning approval shall be as follows:
      (1)   Step 1 - Application.
         A.   The applicant shall submit an application in accordance with
Section
1129.02: Common Review Requirements, and with the provisions of this section.
         B.   If the construction, alteration, or change proposed in the
application is subject to a building permit, the certificate of zoning approval
will be reviewed as part of the building permit application and not subject to
this procedure. Where a building permit is not required, the applicant shall
submit an application for a certificate of zoning approval.
      (2)   Step 2 - Director of Community Development Review and Decision on a
Certificate of Zoning Approval.
         A.   The Director of Community Development may distribute the
application to other staff members and other City departments to solicit
comment on the certificate of zoning approval application.
         B.   Within thirty (30) days after the application is determined to be
complete, or an extended timeframe approved by the applicant, the Director of
Community Development shall make a decision on the certificate of zoning
approval application. In making its decision, the Director of Community
Development may approve or deny the application. The Director of Community
Development may also approve with modifications or supplementary conditions
necessary to ensure the proposed activity will be in full compliance with this
code.
         C.   Prior to making a decision, the Director of Community Development
shall have the authority to provide comments to the applicant regarding
necessary revisions to bring the application into full compliance.
         D.   If the Director of Community Development fails to act within
thirty (30) days from the date the application is determined to be complete, or
an extended period as may be agreed upon by the Director of Community
Development and applicant, then the application shall be considered denied.
         E.   Where revisions are necessary for approval, the application shall
not be deemed formally approved until the applicant makes all of the
appropriate changes and submits all necessary revised forms, maps, and
documents to the Director of Community Development.
         F.   When the Director of Community Development denies an application,
the Director of Community Development shall inform the applicant of the reason
for the denial, including the regulation(s) which would be violated by the
proposed use or development.
         G.   Public Improvements Required. If the installation of public
improvements is required, the following requirements shall apply regardless if
the development is part of a subdivision application or not:
            i.   A certificate of zoning approval shall not be issued until an
agreement is provided to the City to construct the required improvements.
            ii.   The applicant shall be required to provide a financial
guarantee (See Section
1125.07.) in the amount of the estimated cost of the required public
improvements as determined by the City Engineer.
            iii.   The agreement and the financial guarantee shall provide for
completion of all work within a time specified to be determined by the City
Engineer or before occupancy is allowed in any structure, whichever shall occur
first.
            iv.   The approval of the site plan or the installation of public
improvements as required by this code shall not obligate the City to accept
improvements for maintenance, repair or operation. Acceptance shall be subject
to local or state regulations where applicable, concerning the acceptance of
each type of improvement.
            v.   Upon issuance of a certificate of zoning approval, the
applicant may proceed with the approved work.
   
   (e)   Review Criteria for a Certificate of Zoning Approval. In order to
approve any certificate of zoning approval, the Director of Community
Development shall determine the following:
      (1)   The application complies with all applicable provisions of this
code and the applicable zoning district; and
      (2)   The application complies with all approved plans, conditions, or
other development approvals issued pursuant to the rules of this code (e.g.,
variances, administrative waivers, conditional uses, alternative equivalency
reviews, COAs, etc.).
   (f)   Administrative Waiver Requests.
      (1)   Applicability.
         A.   The Director of Community Development may grant administrative
waivers for any area or dimensional regulation that does not exceed ten percent
(10%) of the applicable minimum or maximum regulation. Area and dimensional
regulations include, but are not limited to, minimum front, side, and rear yard
setbacks; maximum height of structures; maximum sign height; maximum sign area,
etc.
         B.   An administrative waiver for a minimum lot area or lot width
requirement is prohibited and shall be subject to a variance review by the BZA
in accordance with Section
1129.11.
         C.   The applicant shall be required to apply for a variance for any
waiver request that exceeds ten percent (10%) or other variations from the code
that do not qualify for administrative waivers.
      (2)   Administrative Waiver Review Procedure and Decision.
         A.   Administrative waivers shall be reviewed as part of the
certificate of zoning approval review procedure.
         B.   In making a decision on the administrative waiver, the Director
of Community Development shall approve or deny the application.
         C.   In approving an administrative waiver, the Director of Community
Development may impose conditions on the approval, the proposed use, and the
premises to be developed or used pursuant to such approval as they determine
are required to be ensure compliance with the standards of this section and the
purposes of this code. Any conditions established by the Director of Community
Development shall relate directly to the requested administrative waiver.
      (3)   Review Criteria for Administrative Waivers. Decisions on an
administrative waiver shall be based on consideration of the same review
criteria as an area and dimensional variance in Section
1129.11(c)(1).
   (g)   Time Limits.
      (1)   The applicant shall obtain an approved building permit, where
required, and have initiated work within one year of the approval of a
certificate of zoning approval or the approval shall be revoked. The initiation
of work shall be when the ground has been broken, construction on site
improvements has begun, or construction of structures has begun.
      (2)   For activities that do not require a building permit, the activity
shall have been substantially begun within one year of approval and is
thereafter pursued to completion, as determined by the Director of Community
Development.
      (3)   All work authorized by a certificate of zoning approval shall have
been completed and the certificate of zoning compliance issued within two (2)
years of the approval of a certificate of zoning approval.

authorized in Section
1111.02. An approval of a certificate of zoning approval for a temporary use
shall include the approved start and end dates for the proposed temporary use.
      (5)   If construction activities for which a certificate of zoning
approval has been issued are abandoned or suspended for a period of six (6)
months after the time of commencing the work, the certificate of zoning
approval shall be revoked. Abandonment shall be defined as the lack of building
activity or progress towards achieving the scope of work defined in the
certificate of zoning approval.
      (6)   Upon written request, up to two (2) extensions of six (6) months
may be granted by the Director of Community Development if the applicant can

of the revocation of a certificate of zoning approval including notice that
further work as described in the canceled permit shall not proceed unless and
until a new certificate of zoning approval has been obtained or extension
granted.
      (8)   Upon revocation of a certificate of zoning approval, a new
application, including all applicable fees, shall be required before a new
certificate of zoning approval application will be reviewed.
      (9)   The above time limits shall not apply if alternative time limits
that have been approved by the Director of Community Development, Planning
Commission, or BZA, in accordance with the applicable review procedure.
   (h)   Revoking a Certificate of Zoning Approval. A certificate of zoning
approval shall be revocable, if among other things, the actual development
activity does not conform to the terms of the application and permit granted
thereon. In the event of the revocation of a permit, an appeal may be taken to
the BZA in accordance with Section
1129.13: Appeals, of this code.
   (i)   Appeals. Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by
any final action of the Director of Community Development shall have the right

CHAPTER 1131
Nonconformities
1131.01   Purpose.
1131.02   General provisions.
1131.03   Nonconformities and variances.
1131.04   Nonconforming uses.
1131.05   Nonconforming structures and ites.
1131.06   Nonconforming lots of record.
1131.07   Nonconforming signs.
1131.08   Nonconforming fences and alls.
1131.09   Repair and maintenance.
   1131.01 PURPOSE.
   Within the districts established by this code, some lots, uses of lands or
structures, or combinations thereof may exist which were lawful prior to the
effective date or amendment of this code, but that are prohibited, regulated,
or restricted under the terms of this code. The legitimate interests of those
who lawfully established these nonconformities, especially when dealing with a
person's residence, are herein recognized by providing for the continuance of
such uses, subject to regulations limiting their completion, restoration,
reconstruction, extension, and/or substitution. Nevertheless, while it is the
intent of this code that such nonconformities be allowed to continue until
removed, they should not be encouraged to survive, unless otherwise allowed in
this chapter or specifically addressed in this code. This chapter has the
further purposes for nonconformities:
   (a)   To permit their continuance but control nonconformities so as to
minimize any adverse effect on the adjoining properties and development;
   (b)   To regulate their maintenance and repair;
   (c)   To restrict their rebuilding if substantially destroyed;
   (d)   To require their permanent discontinuance if not operated for certain
periods of time; and
   (e)   To require conformity if they are discontinued, and to bring about
eventual conformity in accordance with the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan
and this code. (Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1131.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Any structure, land, or use of land or a structure that existed at the
time of the effective date of this code, that was legally established under a
previous code amendment or versions, may be continued even if such use,
building, structure, or use of land does not conform to the provisions of this
code.
   (b)   For the purposes of this code, and any future amendments, any use,
building, or structure that can be proven to have existed prior to the adoption
of Ordinance 82-61, effective February 10, 1983, is deemed to be legally
established.
   (c)   An applicant for any development review procedure (e.g., certificate
of zoning approval, site plan review, variance, etc.) that involves a
nonconformity shall bear the burden of proof in demonstrating that the use,
building, or structure, or combination thereof, was a legal nonconformity after
February 10, 1983.
   (d)   Passage of this code in no way legalizes any illegal uses existing at
the time of its adoption.
   (e)   Existing Use Reclassified as a Conditional Use. In the event an
existing use that was permitted by right at the time the use was established is
thereafter reclassified as a conditional use in the applicable district due to
a zoning text amendment, such use shall be considered to be an approved
conditional use without any further action. However, any subsequent change to
such use shall require review and approval in accordance with Section
1129.04. Such use, provided it is conditionally permitted in the applicable
district, shall not be considered a nonconforming use.
(Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1131.03 NONCONFORMITIES AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Whenever any nonconformity has been changed so that the use,
structure, or condition conforms to the requirements of this code, such use,
structure, or condition shall no longer be defined as a nonconformity, nor
shall the property or structure be returned to the former nonconformity.
   (b)   When a property owner or authorized agent is granted a variance for a
nonconformity that addresses the nonconformity, the structure or lot shall no
longer be considered nonconforming. In no case shall the resolved nonconformity
be expanded or altered to create further nonconformities.
   (c)   If a property owner or authorized agent is granted a variance for a
nonconformity that addresses some nonconformities but additional
nonconformities continue, the structure or condition that remains a
nonconformity shall still be subject to the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2022-22. Passed 5-10-22.)
   1131.04 NONCONFORMING USES.
   Where, at the time of adoption of this code, lawful uses of land or
structures exist that would not be permitted by the regulations of this code,
the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful and provided:
   (a)   No such nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land or structure than was occupied at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this code except as follows:
      (1)   A nonconforming residential building may be enlarged if the
required yard areas are determined adequate by the Planning Commission, as
determined by approval of a conditional use.
      (2)   Buildings containing any other nonconforming use may be improved by
a conditional use permit granted under the provisions of Section
1129.04.
   (b)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved, in whole or in part, to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this code.
   (c)   No additional structures shall be constructed on a lot with a
nonconforming use unless such new structure complies with the requirements of
this code and the applicable zoning district.
   (d)   Termination of Nonconforming Uses.
      (1)   Termination of Use through Discontinuance.
         A.   When any nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for more
than six months, any new use shall conform to the regulations of the district
in which it is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be
resumed. The intent to continue a nonconforming use shall not be evidence of
its continuance.
         B.   There may be cases when a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, may not be converted to a conforming use because of the original
floor plan and design (e.g., townhouses in a single-family residentially zoned
area). In these cases, the Planning Commission may determine that the
nonconforming use may continue if the nonconforming use is the original use of
the structure and/or premises. Appropriate safeguards, conditions and design
standards may be required by the Planning Commission so as to minimize the
impact of such continuance on the area.
      (2)   Termination of Use by Damage or Destruction.
         A.   If a nonconforming residential use, in any district, is damaged
or destroyed to any extent, such structure and use may be reestablished on the
same lot provided the structure and use meet the same size in height and
footprint, as well as complying with the same setbacks as previously existed.
         B.   If any building containing a nonconforming use, other than a
residential use, is damaged, but not to an extent greater than sixty percent
(60%) of the principal structure's reconstruction value, such structure and use
may be reestablished on the same lot to the same size and intensity of use as
was previously existing immediately prior to the damage. Such reestablishment
of the use shall require the issuance of a building permit, which must be
issued within six months of the damage or the use shall not be reestablished.

   A nonconforming structure or site may continue to be used or occupied by a
use permitted in the applicable zoning district so long as it remains otherwise
lawful and does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the following
provisions:
   (a)   Any nonconforming structure or site may be enlarged, maintained,
repaired, or altered provided, however, no such enlargement, maintenance,
repair or alteration shall either create an additional nonconformity or
increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of all or any part of such
structure or site, unless otherwise specified in this code.
   (b)   A nonconforming structure shall not be relocated in whole or in part
to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the entire structure
shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the applicable zoning district
after being relocated.
   (c)   The principal use of a nonconforming building may be changed to any
other use permitted in the applicable zoning district as long as the new use
complies with all regulations of this code specified for such use, except the
regulations to which the building did not conform prior to the change in use.
   (d)   The governmental acquisition of a portion of a lot for a public
purpose that results in reduction in a required yard or building setback below
that required in the applicable zoning district shall not render a structure
nonconforming.
   (e)   Damage or Destruction of a Nonconforming Structure Containing a
Conforming Use.
      (1)   If a nonconforming structure is damaged, but not to an extent
greater than sixty percent (60%) of the structure's reconstruction value, such
structure and use may be reestablished on the same lot to the same size and
intensity of use as was previously existing immediately prior to the damage.
Such reestablishment of the use shall require the issuance of a building permit
within six (6) months of the initial damage. If an owner rebuilds a legally
nonconforming structure under this provision, they may expand the structure
provided any expansion or change does not increase the nonconformity that
existed prior to the damage.
      (2)   If a nonconforming structure is damaged beyond sixty percent (60%)
of the structure's reconstruction value, such structure shall only be rebuilt
in compliance with the requirements of this code. Such reconstruction shall
require the application and issuance of all necessary zoning and building
permits.
      (3)   If the owner voluntarily removes a nonconforming structure, or
reduces the nonconformity of a nonconforming structure that has not been
damaged or destroyed, that owner shall not be permitted to rebuild the
structure to the original height, size, or setback.
      (4)   The determination of the reconstruction value shall be made in the
same manner as established in Section
1131.04(d)(2).

or altered. However, the building may not be enlarged in floor area unless the
depth of front yard, total width of side yards, and the rear yard regulations
are complied with.
   (b)   If vacant, the lot may be used provided that:
      (1)   No adjoining vacant lot or parcel of land was owned by the same
owner on the effective date of this code;

   1321.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Sharonville, State of
Ohio, does ordain as follows:
   
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Sharonville has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
            (1)    Protect human life and health;
            (2)    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects;
            (3)    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
            (4)    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
            (5)    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
            (6)    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper
use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property
and minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
            (8)    Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties
within and near flood prone areas;
            (9)    Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of
the floodplain are maintained;
            (10)    Minimize the impact of development on the natural,
beneficial values of the floodplain;
            (11)    Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
            (12)    Meet community participation requirements of the National
Flood Insurance Program.
   
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
            (1)    Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to
health, safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
            (2)    Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including
facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time
of initial construction.
            (3)    Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
            (4)    Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and
other development which may increase flood damage; and,
            (5)    Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers
which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards
in other areas.
   
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Sharonville as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by the City of Sharonville.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
            (1)    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) for Hamilton County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both effective June 7,
2023.
             (2)    Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
            (3)    Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored
by a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been
approved by the City of Sharonville as required by Section
1321.04.
     Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City of Sharonville City Hall, Department of
Community Development, 10900 Reading Road, Sharonville, Ohio.
   
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
            (1)    Considered as minimum requirements;
            (2)    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
            (3)    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict
with a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence
over these regulations.
   
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Sharonville, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2023-40-E. Passed 5-9-23.)
   1321.02 DEFINITIONS.
      Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
     (a)    Accessory Structure. A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
      (b)    Appeal. A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a

      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)    Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)    Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
            Zone A:
      Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given
year; base flood elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
base flood elevations are determined.
Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
with flood depths of one to three (1 to 3) feet (usually sheet flow on sloping

depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than one (1)
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)    Flood Insurance Study (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)    Floodproofing. Any combination of structural and non-structural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents.
   (q)    Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus 1 foot of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator plus one (1) foot of
freeboard.
   (r)    Floodway. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height as specified in the Flood Insurance Study. In no case shall the
designated height be more than 0.5 (one-half) foot at any point within the
community.
         The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (s)    Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (t)    Historic Structure. Any structure that is:
      (1)    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)    Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)    Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of Sharonville whose historic preservation program has been
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (u)    Hydrologic and Hydraulic Engineering Analysis. An analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
      (v)    Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.
LOMC's are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A comment by FEMA
regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the
hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in
the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood
elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does not amend or revise
effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood
Insurance Studies.
   (w)    Lowest Floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (x)    Manufactured Home. A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 4781 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (y)    Manufactured Home Park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
4781-12-01(K) a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority. Manufactured home park does not
include any tract of land used solely for the storage or display for sale of
manufactured homes.
      (z)    Mean Sea Level. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance
Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to
which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are
referenced.
    (aa)    National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (bb)    New Construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by
the City of Sharonville and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
"start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
FIRM [January 2, 1987] and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (cc)    Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15(A)(2) as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,

addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
            (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions;
or
            (2)    Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".

          A.   Each federal agency has a responsibility to evaluate the
potential effects of any actions it may take in a floodplain; to ensure that
its planning programs and budget request reflect consideration of flood hazards
and floodplain management; and to prescribe procedures to implement the
policies and requirements of EO 11988.
   (k)    Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Sharonville flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1321.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
            (1)    Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.    For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.    Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;

Conditional Letter of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain
development permit for:
                     1.    Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the
base flood elevation; and
                     2.    Proposed development which increases the base flood
elevation by more than 0.5 one-half (0.5) foot in riverine areas where FEMA has
provided base flood elevations but no floodway.
         D.    Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (k)(1)A.
            (2)    Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain
Administrator may request changes to any of the information shown on an
effective map that does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base
flood elevations, such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission
shall include appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor
of the City of Sharonville, and may be submitted at any time.
            (3)    Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Sharonville have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Sharonville's Flood Insurance Rate Maps accurately represent the City's
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Sharonville suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits
or the new area for which the City of Sharonville has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   
   (l)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)    In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
       (2)    Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
            (3)    The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations,
where needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of
special flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of
the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in Section
 1321.05.
            (4)    Where an existing or proposed structure or other development
is affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or
both, the development activity must comply with the provisions of this
ordinance applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base
flood elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or
for other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
   (m)   Use of Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or Flood Insurance
Study Data.
      (1)   Zone A:
         A.   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from
the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall reasonably utilized as best available
data.
         B.   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
            (2)    Zones AE, A1-30, AH, and AO:
          A.   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
            1.    Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
            2.    Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not
be used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or
until all appeals have been resolved.
         B.   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
1321.04(i)(2) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the
best data available.
             (3)    Zones B, C, and X:
          A.   Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are
not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM
which are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, AO, VE, or V1-30. Communities
are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
   (n)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
tornado, wind, heavy snow, flood, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
                  A.    Determine whether damaged structures are located in
special flood hazard areas;
                  B.    Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged
structures located in special flood hazard areas; and
                  C.    Require owners of substantially damaged structures to
obtain a floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
            (2)    Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement
other measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and
subsequent repair process. These measures include issuing press releases,
public service announcements, and other public information materials related to
the floodplain development permits and repair of damaged structures;
coordinating with other federal, state, and local agencies to assist with
substantial damage determinations; providing owners of damaged structures
materials and other information related to the proper repair of damaged
structures in special flood hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially
damaged structures with Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

 1321.03(c) and (d), and meet all standards of subsection (d) hereof.
      (h)    Gas or Liquid Storage Tanks. Within zone A, A1-A30, AE, AO, or AH,
new or substantially improved above ground gas or liquid storage tanks shall be
anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic
and hydrostatic loads.
      (i)    Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
            (1)    Development in Floodways.
                  A.    In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase
in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to
issuance of a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional
engineer, demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any
increase in the base flood elevation; or
                  B.    Development in floodway areas causing increases in the
base flood elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are
completed by the applicant:
                     1.    Meet the requirements to submit technical data in
Section
1321.03(k)(1);
                    2.    An evaluation of alternatives which would not result
in increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives
are not feasible;
                     3.    Certification that no structures are located in
areas which would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
                     4.    Documentation of individual legal notices to all
impacted property owners within and outside the community, explaining the
impact of the proposed action on their property; and
                     5.    Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Sharonville
and the Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the
proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations.
                  A.    In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided, the cumulative effect of any
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, shall not increase the base flood elevation more than one-half
(0.5) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit,
the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis, conducted by a
registered professional engineer demonstrating that this standard has been met;
or,
                  B.    Development in riverine special flood hazard areas
identified by FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no
floodways have been designated causing more than one-half (0.5) foot increase
in the base flood elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are
completed by the applicant:
                     1.    An evaluation of alternatives which would result in
an increase of one-half (0.5) foot or less of the base flood elevation and an
explanation why these alternatives are not feasible;
                     2.    Subsection (i)(1)B.1. and 3. to 5.
            (3)    Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
                  A.    The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or
relocated portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the
issuance of a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a
description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated
as a result of the proposed development, and certification by a registered
professional engineer that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the
watercourse will not be diminished.
                  B.    Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be
notified prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of
such notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
                  C.    The applicant shall be responsible for providing the
necessary maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse
so that the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Sharonville specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1321.03(k)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
                     (Ord. 2023-40-E. Passed 5-9-23.)
   1321.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
      (a)   Appeals Board Established.
            (1)    The City Council shall appoint an Appeals Board consisting
of the members of the City of Sharonville Planning Commission. The members
shall serve six (6) year terms after which time they shall be reappointed or
replaced by the City Council. Each member shall serve until his/her successor
is appointed.
            (2)    A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals
Board. Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held
at the call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
the City of Sharonville City Hall, Department of Community Development, 10900
Reading Road, Sharonville, Ohio.
   
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)    The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of
these regulations.
      (2)    Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) of these
regulations.
   (c)    Appeals.
            (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within thirty (30) days of the date of such notice and
order, or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such
hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the
Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by
the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of
the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
            (2)    Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties
in interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is
submitted.
   
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, due to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a
literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.    Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
                  B.    Such application at a minimum shall contain the
following information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant,
legal description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
                  C.    All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by
a variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of
Sharonville.
            (2)    Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule
and hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator..
            (3)    Public Hearing.
                  A.    At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
                      1.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other
lands to the injury of others.
                     2.    The danger to life and property due to flooding or
erosion damage.
                     3.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its
contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
                     4.    The importance of the services provided by the
proposed facility to the community.
                     5.    The availability of alternative locations for the
proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
                    6.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront
location, where applicable.
                     7.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
and anticipated development.
                     8.    The relationship of the proposed use to the
comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area.
                     9.    The safety of access to the property in times of
flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.
                     10.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of
rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action,
if applicable, expected at the site.
                     11.    The costs of providing governmental services during
and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and
streets and bridges.
                  B.    Variances shall only be issued upon:
                    1.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
                     2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
                    3.    A determination that the granting of a variance will
not result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
                     4.    A determination that the structure or other
development is protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
                     5.    A determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
                  C.    Upon consideration of the above factors and the
purposes of these regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
these regulations.
            (4)    Other Conditions for Variances.
                  A.    Variances shall not be issued within any designated
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
                  B.    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction
and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3) 1. to 11. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
                  C.    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be
given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a
lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)    All testimony shall be given under oath.
            (2)    A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
            (3)    The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and
testimony in support of the appeal or variance.
            (4)    The administrator may present evidence or testimony in
opposition to the appeal or variance.
            (5)    All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the
adverse party or their counsel.
            (6)    Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall
become part of the record for appeal.
            (7)    The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
            (8)    The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas,
pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Chapter 2506.
(Ord. 2023-40-E. Passed 5-9-23.)
   1321.06 ENFORCEMENT.

business, and/or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling
affected.
   
   (c)    Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a fourth degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the City of Sharonville. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent the City of Sharonville from taking such other lawful action as
