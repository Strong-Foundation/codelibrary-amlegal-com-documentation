EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

PREAMBLE
   We, the citizens of the Village of Greenhills, a community to which all
people of good will are welcome, in order to fully secure and exercise the
benefits of local self-government, do ordain and establish this Charter for the
government of the Village of Greenhills.
ARTICLE I
INCORPORATION, POWERS, AND FORM OF GOVERNMENT
SECTION 1.01 INCORPORATION.
   The present Municipality, known as the Village of Greenhills, Ohio shall
continue to be a body politic and corporate under the name of the Village of
Greenhills, with the same boundaries, but with the powers and authority to
change its boundaries and annex other territory contiguous thereto in the
manner authorized by the laws of the State of Ohio. No territory shall be
detached from the Municipality, nor shall the Municipality be annexed to any
other Municipality without the consent of a majority of municipal electors
voting on such question. Such question shall be submitted to the electors only
at a general election in such manner as the Council shall by resolution or
ordinance prescribe.
SECTION 1.02 POWERS.
   The Village of Greenhills shall have all the powers of local self-government
and the benefits of municipal home rule that may now or hereafter be lawfully
possessed or exercised by municipal corporations under the Constitution of the
State of Ohio. All such powers shall be exercised in the manner prescribed in
this Charter, or, to the extent that the manner is not prescribed herein, in
such manner as shall be provided by ordinance or resolution of the Council. Any
such ordinance or rule shall supersede and override state statutes.
SECTION 1.03 FORM OF GOVERNMENT.
   The form of government provided in this Charter shall be known as the
"Mayor-Council- Manager Plan". The powers of the municipal government shall be
distributed among the Municipality, the electorate, the various elected and
appointed officials, and the boards and commissions as provided under the
provisions of this Charter.
ARTICLE II
COUNCIL
SECTION 2.01 NUMBER, TERMS, QUALIFICATIONS OF COUNCIL.
   Council shall consist of six (6) members to be elected from the Municipality
at large on a partisan ballot to serve overlapping four (4) year terms. There
shall be a Councilmanic election held every two years. Members of Council shall
be sworn into office the first meeting of January of the year following their
election.
   Previously elected Councilpersons shall serve until the end of their terms.
At the municipal general election to be held in November, 1989, the four (4)
persons elected shall serve the following terms:
   A.   The three (3) elected Councilpersons receiving the greatest number of
votes shall serve four-year terms.
   B.   The fourth elected Councilperson shall serve a two-year term.
   Thereafter, all members of Council shall be elected to terms of four (4)
years each.
   Members of Council shall have been qualified electors of the Municipality
for at least twelve (12) consecutive months immediately prior to the time of
filing as candidates for the office of Council; shall remain qualified electors
and residents thereof throughout their terms of office; and shall hold no other
elective public office. No member of Council shall be employed by the
Municipality. Any member of Council who ceases to possess or who violates any
of the qualifications herein provided shall forfeit the office. Failure to
maintain qualifications or removal from office shall not render void nor
invalidate any action of Council in which such member participated.
SECTION 2.02 COMPENSATION OF COUNCIL.
   Ordinances presently in force establishing salaries shall remain in effect
for the first Charter Council, and thereafter be established by Council
according to their rules of organization.
   Compensation of a Councilmember shall not be changed during the term for
which such Councilmember was elected or appointed.
SECTION 2.03 MEETINGS OF COUNCIL AND OF COMMITTEES OF COUNCIL.
   Council shall meet at such times as set by its rules, but not less than once
a month. A majority of all the members elected shall constitute a quorum to do
business, but a lesser number may adjourn by majority vote from day to day, and
compel the attendance of absent members in such manner as provided by the Rules
of Council. Except in case of emergency declared by the Mayor, no special
meeting may be called unless notice as provided by Rules of Council be given
thereof at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of such meeting.
   All meetings of Council and of Committees of Council shall be open to the
public, except as otherwise provided in the Ohio Revised Code.
(Amended 11-8-11; 11-5-13.)
SECTION 2.04 ROLE OF THE MAYOR AND VETO POWER.
   The Mayor shall serve as President of Council. The Mayor has the right to

therein except in the case of a tie vote.
   The Mayor shall have no veto power over resolutions and ordinances.

imposed thereon by this Charter and the Constitution of the State of Ohio.

SECTION 2.06 ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS OF COUNCIL.
   Actions of Council shall be by Ordinance, Resolution, or Motion. Motions
shall be used to conduct the business of Council, in procedural matters, for
elections conducted among Council members and as otherwise provided in this
Charter. All other action shall be taken by Ordinance or Resolution. No action
of Council shall be invalidated merely because the form thereof fails to comply
with the provisions of this section.
   Any member of Council, or the Mayor, may propose any Ordinance or
Resolution, at a regular or special meeting, which shall be in written form and
which shall contain a concise title.
   The form and style of Ordinances and Resolutions shall be determined by
Council.
   A.   An Ordinance is a law intended to permanently direct and control
matters applying to persons or issues in general, pertaining to public safety,
health, morals and general welfare. Issues involving public streets and
sidewalks, pet restrictions, etc. are examples of what should be addressed by
ordinance.
   Each Ordinance shall be read on two separate meeting dates, unless this
requirement is dispensed with by a vote of the majority of the members of
Council. The first reading may be by title only. The second readings shall be
in full unless this requirement is dispensed with by majority vote of Council.
   Ordinances shall require a majority four (4) votes of Council for enactment.
Ordinances are enforceable and become effective thirty (30) days after adoption
unless an emergency clause is included, in which case the ordinance becomes
effective immediately.
   B.   A Resolution is an expression of opinion on matters of public policy or
for internal administrative purposes, limited to a specific issue and not
intended to be permanent nor to be enforceable. Actions that grant a waiver
from building codes or authorize the expenditure of public funds are examples
of what should be addressed by resolution.
   Resolutions may be introduced and acted upon after a single reading and go
into effect immediately with majority four (4) acceptance by vote of Council.
   The vote on the question of passage of each Resolution, Ordinance, or Motion
shall be taken by "yea" or "nay" and the vote entered into the minutes. No
measure shall be passed without a concurrence of a majority of the members of
Council.
   Emergency Ordinances or Resolutions shall require a supermajority five of
six (5 of 6) affirmative votes of Council for enactment. If any Emergency
Ordinance shall fail to receive the required supermajority five of six (5 of 6)
affirmative votes but receives the necessary majority for passage as non-
emergency legislation, it shall become effective as non-emergency legislation.
The Council before enacting shall determine that the Ordinance is necessary for
the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety, or welfare of
the citizens of Greenhills, Ohio, and the Ordinance shall contain a statement
of the necessity of declaring the emergency.
   Each Ordinance or Resolution shall be authenticated by the Clerk. The
failure to sign shall not invalidate an otherwise properly enacted Resolution
or Ordinance.
   The Clerk shall cause each Ordinance and Resolution adopted to be published
at the Municipal Building and the Village Website plus other sites as
determined by Council:
   A.   The posting shall be maintained, for a minimum period of fifteen (15)
days;
   B.   Publishing a concise summary of the provisions of the Ordinance/
Resolution in a newspaper or other publication determined by Council to be of
circulation within the Municipality once is satisfactory as an optional
site.   
   Failure to post or publish, or to maintain such posting shall not delay nor
invalidate the effective date of an ordinance or resolution, and in such events
the Clerk shall post/publish at a later date.
   By a majority vote of its members, Council shall cause the codification of
the laws and ordinances of the Municipality. This codification will be updated
at least every five (5) years to include all new legislation. Copies of this
code shall be placed in the Public Library, the Mayor's office, the Village
Website and the municipal offices for public use.

   When the Mayor is absent from the Municipality or is unable, for any cause
as determined by majority vote of Council, to perform the duties, the President
Pro-Tempore shall be the acting Mayor, and shall have all the powers and
perform the same duties as the Mayor.
   When both the Mayor and the President Pro-Tempore are absent from the
Municipality or are unable, for any cause as determined by majority vote of

acting Mayor, and shall have all the powers and perform the same duties as the

not conflict with this Charter, and which shall remain in effect until amended,
changed, or repealed by a majority vote of Council. These rules shall go into
immediate effect. On any point not covered by rules of Council, Roberts Rules
of Order, as revised, shall apply.
SECTION 2.09 AMENDING LEGISLATION.
   No ordinance or resolution, or section or subsection thereof, shall be
revised or amended unless the ordinance or resolution superseding it contains a
restatement of the entire resolution or ordinance, or a restatement of the
section or subsection thereof to be revised or amended. Upon being revised or
amended, the portions of the original legislation which are in conflict with

the name and address of the person filing the petition and the date of such
filing, and deliver to such person a receipt therefor and attach a copy thereof
to said petition. The petition may be circulated in separate parts, but the
separate parts shall be bound together and filed as one instrument.
   Each part shall contain the name and office of the person whose removal is
sought and a statement in not more than two hundred (200) words of the grounds
for the removal. Such petition shall be signed by at least that number of
electors which equals twenty-five (25) percent of the total number of electors
voting at the last preceding regular Municipal election.
   Within ten (10) days after the day on which such petition shall have been
filed, the Clerk of Council shall determine whether or not it meets the
requirements hereof. If the said Clerk shall find the petition insufficient,
the Clerk shall promptly certify the particulars in which the petition is
defective, deliver a copy of the certificate to the person who filed the
petition, and make a record of such delivery.

of the votes cast at such election shall be voted affirmatively, such official
shall remain in office. If a majority of the votes cast shall be voted

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.

continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.

number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

Official Standards
   EDITOR’S NOTE:  The State of Ohio operates on eastern daylight savings time
from 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of daylight savings time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
daylight savings time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio Legislature through inaction has elected to
observe eastern daylight savings time throughout the State of Ohio.

of any such future meeting states that any specific type of public business,

   (b)   Any notification provided herein to be given by the Clerk may be given
by any person acting in behalf of or under the authority of the Clerk.

Ch. 109
   111.01 INTRODUCTION.
   It is the policy of the Village of Greenhills that openness leads to a
better informed citizenry, which leads to better government and better public
policy. It is the policy of the Village of Greenhills to strictly adhere to the
State's Public Records Act. All exemptions to openness are to be construed in
their narrowest sense and any denial of public records in response to a valid
request must be accompanied by an explanation, including legal authority, as
outlined in the Ohio Revised Code. If the request is in writing, the
explanation must also be in writing. (Ord. 2012- 53L&R. Passed 1-8-13.)
   111.02 PUBLIC RECORDS.
   "Records" shall have the same meaning as found in the Ohio Revised Code. All
records of the Village of Greenhills are public unless they are specifically
exempt from disclosure under the Ohio Revised Code.
   (a)   It is the policy of the Village that, as required by Ohio law, records
will be organized and maintained so that they are readily available for
inspection and copying. (Ord. 2012-53L&R. Passed 1-8-13.)
   111.03 RECORD REQUESTS.
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian should
contact the requester for clarification, and should assist the requestor in
revising the request.
   (b)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record, except as shall be provided for in the Ohio Revised
Code.
   (c)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly so long as the request does not
interfere with the workings of the Village offices. Copies of public records
must be made available within a reasonable period of time. "Prompt" and
"reasonable" take into account the scope and volume of records requested; the
proximity of the location where the records are stored; staff time and
resources available to process the request; and the necessity for any legal
review of the records requested. The Village also recognizes that certain
information must be redacted from public records prior to any inspection by the
public.
   (d)   In processing a request for inspection of a public record, and
pursuant to the Ohio Attorney General's Model Public Records Policy, an office
employee must accompany the requester during inspection to make certain
original records are not taken or altered.
   (e)   Any denial of public records requested must be done in accordance with
the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 2012-53L&R. Passed 1-8-13.)
   111.04 COPIES.
   Pursuant to R.C. 149.43(B)(6) the Village shall permit the requester to
choose to have the public record duplicated upon paper, upon the same medium
upon which the Village keeps it, or upon any other medium upon which the
Village determines that it reasonably can be duplicated as an integral part of
the normal operations of the Village. However, the Village shall not be
required to allow a requester to make copies or scan copies with his or her own
equipment nor shall the Village be required to provide electric service in
order to power requester's equipment. Those seeking public records will be
charged only the actual cost of making copies.
   (a)   The charge for paper copies is five cents ($.05) per page.
   (b)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is one
dollar ($1.00) per disc.
   (c)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
   (d)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.

Village's expense prior to appointment to probationary status. The purpose of

person, business, contractor, utility or property owner desiring to remove a
tree from the tree lawn, parks, street medians or other public place for the
purpose of construction, or for any other purpose, must first obtain a permit
from the municipality.
      (2)   The Municipal Manager has the authority to grant permits for the
removal of trees from public places. Such permits may be denied if the removal
of tree(s) from a public place is not necessary for the protection of public
health and safety; or can be reasonably avoided; or, in the case of realty
development or construction, unless the permit request is accompanied by a plan
to protect public trees in the general vicinity of construction and add new
trees and/or landscaping if part of the tree lawn is to be removed. The Village
shall review permit applications within fifteen (15) business days of
postmarked date or record of receipt, whichever is earlier; if a permit
application is not acted upon within the specified time, the applicant may deem
the permit to have been denied.
   (b)   Removal of Public Trees by the Village. Whenever it is necessary for
the Village to remove a tree or shrub from a tree lawn or other public place,
in connection with the paving of sidewalk, paving or widening of a street, or
for any other reason, the Village shall make reasonable endeavors to remove and
replant such trees or replace them. No tree over 12 inches in caliper or tree
which is 30 years of age or older, shall be removed without prior review by the
Municipal Manager. Replacement trees shall meet the standards of species, size,
condition and placement set forth in this ordinance, in the Greenhills Tree

or shrub on public property or in the public right-of-way; attach any rope,

burn in any manner that injures any portion of any tree or shrub on public
property or in the public right-of-way.
      (2)   Any public tree(s) that are damaged, but not badly enough to
justify removal, as determined by the Municipal Manager, shall be considered to
be devalued. The person or entity causing such damage shall compensate the
Village for such damage. The monetary amount shall be determined by the
Municipal Manager or the Manager's designee, based on the assessment of a
licensed arborist of the monetary investment required to save the tree(s); or,
if there is a likelihood the tree(s) will not survive the damage inflicted,
then the cost of replacement of tree(s) of like species and caliper; or, if a
different species is more suitable based on current best practices, or the tree
(s) is/are too large to be replaced in kind, then the cost of replacement with
tree(s) of minimum caliper 1-2" of the same species or more suitable species,
as judged by a licensed arborist.
   (d)   Tree Topping. Street trees or public trees shall not be topped except
in such circumstances when the trees are severely damaged by storms by other
natural causes, or when such trees are under utility wires or other
obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical. Tree topping shall
be considered as the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than three
inches in diameter within the trees' crown to such a degree so as to remove the
normal canopy and/or disfigure the tree. As a matter of policy, the Municipal
Manager should make all utility providers aware of the standards for tree
topping of public and street trees within the Village, and take all reasonable
steps to insure that the pruning of public trees by utility companies is
consistent with these standards.
(Ord. 2012-30S&S. Passed 7-17-12.)
   169.08 REALTY DEVELOPMENTS AND CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   No person shall by any type of construction reduce the number of trees
in the tree lawn without first obtaining a permit from the Municipal Manager or
his designee. Efforts should be made to protect public trees from damage and a
plan to install street trees and/or add landscaping should accompany the permit
request.
   (b)   No person in charge of, or responsible for, the erections, alteration
or removal of any building or structure in the municipality shall permit any
tree upon any public place in the vicinity of such operation to stand without a
good and sufficient guard or protection as to prevent injury, damage, or
defacement to such tree arising out of, in connection with, or by reason of
such operation. The sufficiency of such guard or protection shall be determined
by the Municipal Manager at the time of such erection, alteration or removal.
   (c)   No person shall excavate ditches, tunnels, trenches or install a
driveway or sidewalk within a radius of ten feet of any public tree or shrub
without first obtaining written approval from the Municipal Manager.
   (d)   No person shall place or maintain in the ground in any public place
any stone, concrete, brick, or other impervious material or substance in such a
manner as may obstruct the free access of air and water to the roots of any
tree upon any public place in the municipality without first obtaining written
permission of the Municipal Manager.
   (e)   The Village shall review any permit application required under this
section within 15 business days of the postmarked date or record of receipt,
whichever is earlier; if an application is not acted upon within the specified
time, the applicant may deem the permit to have been denied. (Ord. 2012-30S&S.
Passed 7-17-12.)

misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $500 for the first such

any or all of the fine imposed. (Ord. 2012-30S&S. Passed 7-17-12.)
TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
181. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 181
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Greenhills has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Greenhills ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving
moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the
corporate limits of Greenhills, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C. 2937.08
and 2938.04. In keeping his docket and file, the Mayor shall be governed by the
laws pertaining to county courts. Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court
in which a defendant is charged with an offense is not a court of record (the
Mayor's Court), and the charge is such that a right to a jury trial exists,
such matter shall not be tried before him unless the accused, by writing
subscribed by him, waives a jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If
the defendant, in such event, does not waive right to jury trial, then the
magistrate shall require the accused to enter into recognizance to appear
before a court of record in Hamilton County (the Hamilton County Municipal
Court), and the magistrate shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together
with a transcript of proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such
recognizance, if given, to the court of record.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that right to trial by jury shall be
claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the clerk
of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for trial
or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for trial,
whichever is later. Failure to claim jury trial as provided herein is a
complete waiver of right thereto. Jury trial may not be had in courts not of
record, but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial
may be asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of
record as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Greenhills ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   The adoption of "Rules of Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases for all
Courts Inferior to Common Pleas," which was promulgated by The Supreme Court of
Ohio on December 4, 1967, and amended on January 4, 1971, was made mandatory
for Mayors' Courts before March 2, 1969.
181.01   Unpaid or delinquent Court fines, fees and costs; collection fee.

191.01  is hereby levied after December 31, 2005 at the rate of one and one-

   (b)   Business Both In and Outside the Municipal Boundaries. This section
does not apply to taxpayers that are subject to and required to file reports
under Chapter 5745, of the Ohio Revised Code. Except as otherwise provided in
subsection (d) of this section, net profit from a business or profession
conducted both within and without the boundaries of a municipal corporation
shall be considered as having a taxable situs in such municipal corporation for
purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the average
ratio of the following:
      (1)   Multiply the entire net profits of the business by a business
apportionment percentage formula to be determined by:
         A.   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in such
municipal corporation during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in such municipal corporation to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to persons employed in the business or profession,
wherever their services are performed, excluding compensation that is not
taxable by the municipal corporation under Section 718.011 of the Ohio Revised
Code;
         C.   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in such municipal corporation to
gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales
and services, wherever made or performed.
         D.   Adding together the percentages determined in accordance with
subsections (b)(1)A.,B.,C. hereof, or such of the aforesaid percentages as are
applicable to the particular taxpayer, and dividing the total so obtained by
the number of percentages used in deriving such total.
            1.   A factor is applicable even though it may be apportioned
entirely in or outside the Municipality.
            2.   Provided however, that in the event a just and equitable
result cannot be obtained under the business apportionment percentage formula
provided for herein, the Board of Review or the Tax Commissioner, upon
application of the taxpayer, shall, under uniform regulations adopted by the
Board, have the authority to substitute other factors or methods calculated to
effect a fair and proper apportionment.
   (c)   Net Operating Loss (NOL) Carry Forward.
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year,
beginning with April 1, 1970, apportioned to the Municipality may be applied
against the portion of the profit of succeeding taxable years apportioned to
the Municipality, until exhausted, but in no event for more than three (3)
taxable years immediately following the year in which the loss occurred. No
portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of
any prior year.
      (2)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be apportioned
to the Municipality in the same manner as provided herein for apportioning net
profits to the Municipality.
      (3)   The Tax Commissioner shall provide by Rules and Regulations the
manner in which such net operating loss carry forward shall be determined.
      (4)   The net operating loss of a taxpayer that loses its legal identity,
by any means such as merger or consolidation, shall not be allowed as a carry
forward loss deduction to the surviving or new taxpayer.
      (5)   The net operating loss sustained by a business or profession is not
deductible from employee earnings, but may be carried forward as provided in
subsection (c)(1). However, if a taxpayer is engaged in two or more taxable
business activities to be included in the same return, the net loss of one
unincorporated business activity (except any portion of a loss reportable for
municipal income tax purposes to another municipality) may be used to offset
the profits of another for purposes of arriving at overall net profits.
   (d)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   Filing consolidated returns, providing they clearly show the income
and expenses attributable to the Municipality alone, may be permitted,
required, or denied in accordance with the Rules and Regulations prescribed by
the Tax Commissioner.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, the Tax Commissioner shall
require such information, in addition to the return hereinafter provided for,
as he believes necessary to ascertain whether net profits are properly
allocated to the Municipality. If the Tax Commissioner finds net profits are
not properly allocated to the Municipality by reason of transactions with
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, he may require the filing of a
consolidated return or adjust such transactions so as to produce a fair and
proper allocation of net profits to the Municipality.
   (e)   Exceptions. The provisions of the chapter shall not be construed as
levying a tax upon the following:
      (1)   Proceeds from welfare benefits, unemployment insurance benefits,
pensions, social security benefits, and qualified retirement plans as defined
by the Internal Revenue Service.

otherwise.
      (7)   Interest and dividends from intangible property.

      (10)   Any association or organization falling in the category listed in
the preceding paragraph receiving income from non-exempt real estate, tangible
or intangible personal property, or business activities of a type ordinarily
conducted for profit by taxpayers operating for profit shall not be excluded
hereunder.
      (11)   In the event any association or organization receives taxable
income as provided in the preceding paragraph from real or personal property
ownership or income producing business located both within and without the
corporate limits of the Municipality, it shall calculate its income apportioned
to the Municipality under the method or methods provided above.
      (12)   If exempt for federal income tax purposes, fellowship and
scholarship grants are excluded from Municipal income tax.
      (13)   The rental value of a home furnished to a minister of the gospel
as part of his compensation, or the rental allowance paid to a minister of the
gospel as part of his compensation, to the extent used by him to rent or
provide a home pursuant to Section 107 of the Internal Revenue Code.

to a person serving as a precinct official, to the extent that such
compensation does not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) annually. Such
compensation in excess of one thousand dollars may be subjected to taxation.
The payer of such compensation is not required to withhold Municipal tax from
that compensation.

vehicle is operated on a regularly scheduled route, the operator is subject to
such tax by reason of residence or domicile in the Municipality, or the

place of business of the individual’s employer is located in another

   (b)   The return shall be filed with the Tax Administrator on a form or
forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Tax Administrator, or on
an acceptable generic form as defined in this chapter, setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amount of income, qualifying wages, commissions and

profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, or other
information as the Tax Administrator may require, including a statement that
the figures used in the return are the figures used in the return for federal
income tax adjusted to set forth only such income as is taxable under the
provisions of this chapter, and including but not limited to copies of all W-
2 forms, 1099 Miscellaneous, Income Forms, page one of Form 1040, Form 1120,
1120S (including (K-1), 2106 (including Schedule A of Form 1040), 1065,

Schedule F and any other Federal Schedules, if applicable. For businesses the
entire federal return and supporting schedules shall be submitted.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator may extend the time for filing the annual return
upon the request of the taxpayer. The extended due dates for individuals, and
for businesses not filing the extension request through the Ohio Business
Gateway, shall be the last day of the month following the month to which the
federal income tax due has been extended. For businesses filing the extension
request through the Ohio Business Gateway, the extended due date shall be the
last day of the month to which the due date of the federal income tax return
has been extended. The Tax Administrator may deny the extension if the taxpayer
fails to:
      (1)   File the request timely;
      (2)   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request; or
      (3)   The taxpayer’s income tax account with the Municipality is
delinquent in any way. For each year for which an extension is requested, a
tentative return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown to be due
thereon, must be filed by the date the return is normally due. Interest, but no
penalty, shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is filed and the
final tax paid within the period as extended.
   (d)   The taxpayer making the return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so due has been deducted
at the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
191.06, or where any portion of such tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to the provisions of Section
191.07, credit for the amount so paid shall be deducted from the amount shown
to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the final return. Within three months from the final determination of
any federal tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, such
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject
to the Village tax based upon such final determination of federal tax
liability, and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for
return of any overpayment.
   (e)   (1)   Any affiliated group which files a consolidated return for
federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue
Code may file a consolidated return with the Village.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carries on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity with the Village
constituting a portion of its total business, the Tax Administrator shall
require such additional information as may be necessary to ascertain whether
net profits allocable to the Village are being distorted by the shifting of
income, apportionment of expenses or other devices available to a common
control. If the Tax Administrator finds that a person’s net profits allocable
to the Village are distorted by reason of transactions with stockholders or
with other corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates
or transactions with such division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or
activity, or by some other method, he shall adjust such transactions so as to
produce a fair and property allocation of net profits to the Village. If
necessary, the Tax Administrator may require the filing of a consolidated
return.
   (f)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the Village is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his election indicated on the
return, such overpayment, or part thereof, shall be refunded, provided that no
additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall be collected
or refunded.
   (g)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where an amended return must be filed in order to report additional
tax due or claim a refund of tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or
limitations contained in this chapter, such amended return shall be on a form
obtainable on request from the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the
method of accounting (i.e., cash or accrual) or apportionment of net profits
after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer’s Village tax liability such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Village return, showing income subject to the Village
based upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and pay an
additional tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (h)   Each taxpayer may offset business losses against business net profits
from any business conducted in the Village. Business losses in any municipality
that does not levy an income tax on net profits may be used to offset net
profits in the Village. Business net profits in any municipality that does not
levy an income tax on net profits may be offset by losses in the Village.
   (i)   Any business, profession, association or corporation reporting a net
loss is subject to the filing requirements of this chapter.
   (k)   The officer or employee of such employer having control or supervision
or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making the payment
shall be personally liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax,
penalties, or interest due as required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy or
reorganization of any such employer does not discharge any officer’s or
employee’s liability for a prior failure of such business to file the return or
pay taxes, penalties, or interest due.
   (l)   (1)   Retirees having no income considered taxable for Village income
tax purposes may file, with the Tax Administrator, a written request for
exemption from these filing requirements, and shall be exempt if the request is
granted by the Tax Administrator. The request may be submitted by indicating,
on the taxpayer’s annual tax return, the retirement date and the entity from
which retired.
      (2)   The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives income taxable to the Village, at which tie the retiree shall be
required to comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter.
   (m)   The failure of any employer, taxpayer or person to receive or procure
a return, declaration, or other required form shall not excuse him from filing
any information return, tax return, declaration, or other required form, or
from paying the tax.
(Ord. 2012-13. Passed 3-6-12.)
   191.06 COLLECTION OF TAX AT THE SOURCE.
   (a)   Withholding by Employer. Each employer within, or doing business
within, the Municipality who employs one or more persons on a salary, wage,
commission or other compensation basis shall deduct when such salary, wage,
commission or other compensation is paid, allocated or set aside, the tax of
one and one-half percent (1.5%) on the qualifying wages, due by such employer
to each such employee, and shall, on or before the last day of April, July,
October and January of each year, after the effective date of this section make
a return and pay to the Tax Commissioner the amount of taxes so deducted during
the preceding calendar quarter. Payment by electronic funds transfer may be
made to the Tax Commissioner. The Municipality shall adopt Regulations
governing the payment of withheld taxes by electronic funds transfer. The
Regulations shall govern acceptable modes of electronic funds transfer, the
content and format of electronic funds transfers, the coordination of payment
by electronic funds transfer and the filing of associated tax reports and
returns, and any other matter that facilitates payment by electronic funds
transfer. Upon the written request of a taxpayer, the Tax Commissioner shall
implement means of acknowledging receipt of payments made by electronic funds
transfer.
      (1)   Such employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required
to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact been
withheld. Nothing in this section prohibits an employer from withholding tax on
a basis greater than qualifying wages.
   (b)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual’s disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (c)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (d)   Employer Considered as Trustee. Each employer in collecting such tax
shall be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to the
Municipality, as a trustee for the benefit of the Municipality, and any such
tax collected by such employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid
to the Municipality, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer. Each
employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and
withheld, whether or not such tax, in fact, has been withheld.
   (e)   Corporate Officers' Personal Liability. Any person who is required to
withhold tax from qualifying wages shall pay all such tax to the Municipality
in accordance with the provisions of this section. In the event taxes withheld
from the qualifying wages of employees are not paid to the Municipality in
accordance with the provisions of this section, all officers, members,
managers, employees, and trustees having control or supervision of or charged
with the responsibility of filing the return and making payment are jointly and
severally personally liable for the tax not returned or paid to the
Municipality as well as any related interest and penalties, and are also liable
under the provisions of Section
191.12  hereof. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer’s,

corporation, limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or
pay said taxes.
   (f)   Withholding Return; List of Employees. Each employer shall file a

withholding, together with the amount of such withholdings remitted. Such
return shall include information concerning each employee from whom the
Municipal tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip code and social
security number of each such employee, the total amount of compensation paid
during the year and the amount of Municipal tax withheld. If the total tax
withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to another
municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on the return of
information to the Municipality concerning each employee. The withholding tax
reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before February 28
following the end of such calendar year.
   (g)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc.

also report such payments to the Municipality when the services were performed
in the Municipality. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall
include the name, address and social security number (or federal identification
number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal Form(s) 1099 may be
submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on

additional assessment may be made by the Tax Commissioner shall be extended one
(1) year from the time of the final determination of the federal tax liability.
   (b)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund

shall be paid at the rate of interest prescribed by Ohio Revised Code 5703.47.

deducted under division (c)(1)A. of this section, but excluding that portion of

         J.   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's Federal taxable

   192.03   IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   The income tax levied by the Municipality at a rate of one and one-half
percent (1.5%) is levied on the Municipal Taxable Income of every person
residing in and/or earning and/or receiving income in the Municipality.
   (a)   Individuals.
      (1)   For residents of the Municipality, the income tax levied herein
shall be on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other
compensation from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including
the resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities
owned directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the
resident. This is further detailed in the definition of income in Section
192.02(c)(16)).
      (2)   For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
      (3)   For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to “Municipal
Taxable Income” as defined in Section
192.02(c)(21). Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section
192.02(c)(12).
   (b)   Refundable Credit for Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan.
      (1)   A.   As used in this division:
            1.   “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” means a compensation
plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
            2.   “Qualifying loss” means the amount of compensation
attributable to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the
receipt of money and property attributable to distributions from the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Full loss is sustained if no
distribution of money and property is made by the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan. The taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable
year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to that nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            3.   a.   “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for
the taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to the Municipality
with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of
which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
               b.   If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the “qualifying tax rate” is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the
Municipality each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
            4.   “Refundable credit” means the amount of the Municipality
income tax that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         B.   If, in addition to the Municipality, a taxpayer has paid tax to

compensation plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each
municipal corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal
corporation's proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax
paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the
Municipality for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         D.   The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
            1.   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
            2.   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
   (c)   Domicile.
      (1)   A.   1.   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the
Municipality for all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled
in the Municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year
or if the Tax Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is
domiciled in the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
            2.   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described
in division (c)(1)A.1. of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
         B.   For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled
in the Municipality for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
            1.   The individual's domicile in other taxable years;
            2.   The location at which the individual is registered to vote;
            3.   The address on the individual's driver's license;

property tax exemption or reduction allowed on the basis of the individual's
residence or domicile;
            5.   The location and value of abodes owned or leased by the
individual;
            6.   Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual
regarding the individual's residency;
            7.   The primary location at which the individual is employed.
            8.   The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual’s dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,
to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
            9.   The number of contact periods the individual has with the
Municipality. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one “contact
period” with the Municipality if the individual is away overnight from the
individual's abode located outside of the Municipality and while away overnight
from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the Municipality.

Regulations.
   (d)   Intentionally left blank.
   (e)   Intentionally left blank.

business or profession in the Municipality, unless the taxpayer is an
individual who resides in the Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric
company, combined company, or telephone company that is subject to and required
to file reports under R.C. Chapter 5745.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (f)(2) and (g) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            2.   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
192.04(c);
         C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in Municipality
to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period
from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
       (2)   A.   If the apportionment factors described in division (f)(l) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
192.12(a).
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (f)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
192.12(a).
         D.   Nothing in division (f)(2) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (f)(1)B. of this section, “wages, salaries, and

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (f) (3)A. or B. of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

as provided in division (g) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as

of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Municipality's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Municipality or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the
Municipality. The Municipality shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the

real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of the Municipality shall report

tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (f)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it

      (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold an income tax from the
qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in the Municipality.
Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under Section
192.03 or division (a)(2)D. or F. of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
192.03, of 1.5%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct

behalf of the Municipality in the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand
three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars ($200).
            Payment under division (a)(2)A.1. of this section shall be made to
the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month
for which the tax was withheld.
            2.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not

file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or

agent of an employer, or other payer.
         D.   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Municipality income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the

corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
         E.   1.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
            2.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
         F.   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Municipality income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
         G.   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
         H.   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
            1.   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Municipality during the preceding calendar year;
            2.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
            3.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax
was withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the
preceding calendar year;
            4.   Any other information required for Federal income tax
reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 or its equivalent form
with respect to such employee;
            5.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
         I.   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
         J.   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Municipality
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
         K.   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.
   (b)   Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

            3.   “Principal place of work” means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, “principal place of work” means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not

fixed location or worksite location, “principal place of work” means the
location in this State at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
            If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the “greatest number of days in a calendar year” performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (b)(1)B.1.a. of this section among those
two or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair
and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with
division (b)(1)B.2. of this section, except that “location” shall be

events, for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis.
            7.   “Worksite location” means a construction site or other
temporary worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for
more than 20 days during the calendar year. “Worksite location” does not
include the home of an employee.
         B.   1.   Subject to divisions (b)(1)C., E., and F. of this section,
an employer is not required to withhold Municipality income tax on qualifying
wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in the
Municipality if the employee performed such services in the Municipality on 20
or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions
applies:
               a.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Municipality.
               b.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Municipality. For the purposes of this division,
“presumed worksite location” means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in the Municipality at which the employer provides or provided
services that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the employer
to last more than 20 days in a calendar year. Services can “reasonably be
expected by the employer to last more than 20 days” if either of the following
applies at the time the services commence:
                  i.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
                  ii.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
               c.   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
192.04.
               d.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
            2.   For the purposes of division (b)(1)B.1. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Municipality only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Municipality than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more
of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the
employee's principal place of work:
               a.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
               b.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
               c.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to

               e.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
         C.   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (b)(1)B.1. of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
         D.   1.   Except as provided in division (b)(1)D.2 of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Municipality exceeds the 20-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the Municipality for any subsequent
days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in the Municipality.
            2.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the
Municipality under division (b)(1)D.1. of this section may elect to withhold
tax for the Municipality for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the
Municipality.
         E.   If an employer's fixed location is the Municipality and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
192.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Municipality, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of the Municipality.
         To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator
with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
         F.   Divisions (b)(1)B.1. and (b)(1)D. of this section shall not apply
to the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
192.04.
(Ord. 2015-08-F. Passed 10-27-15; Ord. 2018-01-F. Passed 2-27-18.)
   192.05   ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (a)   (1)   An annual Municipality income tax return shall be completed and
filed by every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject
to the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
         A.   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under this Section
192.05 when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to the
tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, and no additional tax is due to the Municipality.
         B.   Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for Municipality
income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption
from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from
which retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the Municipality, at which time
the retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
      (2)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.

perjury.
         B.   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service Form W-
2, “Wage and Tax Statements,” including all information reported on the
taxpayer's Federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service Form 1040 or, in
the case of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation,
Ohio form IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other
documentation necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return.
An individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section
electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing
to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies
after the return has been filed.
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service Form 1041, Form
1065, Form 1120, Form 1120-REIT, Form 1120F, or Form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
         A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
         D.   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (a)(6)
of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic
form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (7)   A.   1.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each return
required to be filed under this section shall be completed and filed as
required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed for the

extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of Municipality's income tax
return. The extended due date of Municipality's income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the
extended due date of Municipality's income tax return for a taxpayer that is
not an individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last
day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to
file under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due
unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
            1.   A copy of the Federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of Municipality's income tax return.
            2.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's Municipality income tax return. If the request is
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipality income
tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested
extension.
         C.   If the Tax Administrator extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a Municipality's income
tax return. The extended due date of Municipality's income tax return shall be
the same as the extended due date of the State income tax return.
         D.   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality, the Tax
Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise
than as provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required
to file annual returns.
         E.   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (7)B., C,, or D. of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
            1.   If a tax administrator violates division (7)E. of this
section, the municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any
reasonable costs incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
            2.   Division (7)E. of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (7)B. of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (7)B. of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (7)B.2. of this section.
         F.   To the extent that any provision in this division (a)(7) of this
section conflicts with any provision in division (c) of this section, the
provisions in division (c) prevail.
      (8)   A.   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net
amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.

taxable year pursuant to division (a)(8)A. of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (a)(6)C. of this
section, unless the provisions of division (a)(8)C. apply.
         C.   1.   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to Municipality income tax ordinance
for a taxable year if both the following apply:
               a.   The person was required to file a tax return with
Municipality for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location (as defined in this chapter within
Municipality.
               b.   The person no longer provides services in Municipality and
does not expect to be subject to Municipality income tax for the taxable year.
            2.   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within Municipality. The affidavit shall also
include the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within Municipality, make any sales in Municipality, or otherwise
become subject to the tax levied by Municipality during the taxable year. If
the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by Municipality for the
taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly
comply as a taxpayer with Municipality income tax ordinance and rules and
regulations.” The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
            3.   If a person submits an affidavit described above the Tax
Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return for the
taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that conflicts
with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit change.
            4.   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from
performing an audit of the person.
      (9)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
      (10)   Taxes withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
192.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Municipality, unless the amounts withheld were
not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.
      (11)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
      (12)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of
any income tax return, report, or document required by the Municipality,
provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the Municipality or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or
tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the
provisions of this chapter and of the Municipality’s ordinance, resolution, or
rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
   (b)   Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file Municipality's
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make

support of the Armed Forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality during the
period of the member's or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter.
The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after
the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such
evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division are not
delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
         B.   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the one hundred
eighty- first day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
         C.   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (c)(2)A. of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.

the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (c)(3)B.1. of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, “qualifying taxpayer” means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the Armed Forces.
            2.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division
(c)(3)B.1. of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (a)(7)B.1. of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
      (4)   For each taxable year to which division (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this

return filed for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
         C.   “Consolidated Federal taxable income” means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated Federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. “Consolidated
Federal taxable income” does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (d)
(1)A. of this section.
         D.   “Incumbent local exchange carrier” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 4927.01.
         E.   “Local exchange telephone service” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 5727.01.
      (2)   A.   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Municipality's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under Federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (d)(2)B. of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
         B.   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (d)(2)B. of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.

binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Municipality. A taxpayer that is required to
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for all subsequent taxable
years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the
Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
      (4)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Municipality income tax
return in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury Regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated Federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (d)(5)B., C., and D.
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section
192.02, by substituting “consolidated Federal taxable income” for “Federal
taxable income” wherever “Federal taxable income” appears in that division and
by substituting “an affiliated group of corporation's” for “a C corporation's”
wherever “a C corporation's” appears in that division.
         B.   No corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
192.02(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
         C.   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
            1.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in division (d) of this section,
exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass- through entity
in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
            2.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in division (d) of this section,
include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in
the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         D.   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
            1.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in division (d) of this section,
exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass- through entity
in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Municipality;
            2.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Municipality
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (6)   Corporations filing a consolidated Municipality income tax return
shall make the computations required under division (d) of this section by
substituting “consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to” for “net
profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in that section and by
substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for “taxpayer” wherever
“taxpayer” appears in that section.
      (7)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax
return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
      (8)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Municipality before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Municipality may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another Municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may
claim a non-refundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the
other Municipality. Subject to division (c) of this section, the credit shall
not exceed 100% of the amount obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying
wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax in the
other Municipality by the rate of one-half of one percent (0.5%).
   (b)   Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district
created under Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it
grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation.
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other Municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
Municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, “the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation” subject to
tax in the other Municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other Municipality by the tax rate for
that Municipality.

withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which
the amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, “date of
the postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the Postal Service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under Section

including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5%) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after

liability for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5%) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         D.   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the

year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Ohio R.C. 718.05.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
192.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date

      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
Municipality under Section
192.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

   192.08   ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required

fractional part of a dollar ($1.00) that is less than fifty cents ($.50) shall
be dropped. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a document, the
person shall round all amounts entered on the document.

   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (c)
(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
192.21.
   (d)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been

      (2)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (e)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
192.18(a)(4).

have been deposited with the Municipality is subject to recovery by the
Municipality. If the Municipality's tax on that income is imposed after the

tax or withholding the Municipality claims is due with respect to such income
or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first Municipality with
respect to such income or wages.
   (c)   If the Municipality's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
Municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Municipality's tax rate. However, If the Municipality's tax rate is greater
than the tax rate in the other Municipality, the tax due in excess of the
nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the Municipality, along with any penalty
and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carry-forward.
(Ord. 2015-08-F. Passed 10-27-15.)
   192.11   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
Municipality changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or
State income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
Municipality. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be

reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return only:

figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
192.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by Section
192.12(e) for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by the Municipality. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
192.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any Federal or State
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Municipality's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Municipality return showing income
subject to Municipality income tax based upon such final determination of
Federal or State tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional
Municipality income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).

have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of
that assessment.

assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Review, of the Ohio Board of

Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
192.09, with interest on that amount as provided by Section
192.09(e).
   (e)   No civil action to recover Municipality income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time

proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.

provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2015-08-F. Passed 10-27-15; Ord. 2018-01-F.Passed 2-27-18.)
   192.14   SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Last known address” means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   “Undeliverable address” means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056 is not able
to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for
non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.

Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the Postal Service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment's postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other Municipality official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local Board of Review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   “This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date.”
   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)(1)A. of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Municipality
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local Board of Review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator’s designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.

municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator’s rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.

   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Municipality

furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Administrator, and Tax Administrators of other municipal corporations.

advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,

levied by the Municipality or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that

to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect

192.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by

the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear before the
Board of Review and may be represented by an attorney at law, certified public
accountant, or other representative. The Board of Review may allow a hearing to

must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.

Administrator’s assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Review
shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the Board
of Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Review's final determination as provided

removed from the property. The notice shall state that the person having a
right to possession of the property shall have the right to file a written
appeal within the thirty-day period requesting a hearing on the notice and that
failure to file the written appeal shall constitute a waiver of such right. The
notice shall also state that failure to comply shall permit the Municipality to

having right to possession of the property, and that this expense shall be in
addition to any criminal penalty otherwise imposed.

with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty days that a vehicle continues
to be so left constitutes a separate offense.

amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
         B.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the offender

   313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree. If the offender commits the offense while
distracted and the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the
commission of the offense, the offender is subject to the additional fine
established under §
303.991.
(R.C. § 4511.12)
   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
   313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

programs offered by head start agencies are boarding or unloading at curbside.
The visual signals and stop warning sign shall be synchronized or otherwise
operated as required by rule of the Board.
   (c)   Where a highway has been divided into four or more traffic lanes, a
driver of a vehicle need not stop for a school bus approaching from the
opposite direction which has stopped for the purpose of receiving or
discharging any school child, persons attending programs offered by community
boards of mental health and County boards of developmental disabilities, or

distributed between front and rear seats. The pupils shall not move from seat
to seat while the bus is in motion.
   (c)   When approaching a “stop” the bus driver shall cause the warning
flasher lights to operate in advance of that “stop” so that motorists may have
sufficient warning of his intention. Proper use of the warning signals can
assist the driver in getting other vehicles by, thus reducing traffic
congestion.
   (d)   In receiving and discharging pupils on the street, the bus shall be
driven to the extreme right side of the paved or traveled portion of the
roadway and brought to a full stop, with the flasher or warning lights in

the road at a point not under control of a traffic officer or clearly visible
electrical or mechanical traffic signal, the pupils shall cross the highway at
a point approximately ten feet in front of the standing bus. The bus shall not
be started until the pupils are safely on their residence side of the road, or
aboard the bus.
   (f)   In no event shall a bus be driven backward on the school grounds where
children are being loaded or unloaded, or upon departing from the school
building no bus shall break the lineup by starting around a bus or buses ahead.
   (g)   The bus driver shall be the sole operator of the entrance door and
shall not open the door until traffic has cleared the bus in both directions;
pupils who must cross the street to reach their destination shall cross in
front of the stopped bus only after the driver has verified that the warning
lamps are operating and has notified them it is safe to cross.
   Note: Flasher lights are to be used only for the loading and unloading of
pupils.
   (h)   The door shall not be closed and the bus started again until such
pupils have reached their residence side of the road.
   (i)   The driver shall not lease the bus until he has stopped the engine,
removed the ignition key and set the brakes.
   (j)   The driver of a school bus shall not use or permit the use of tobacco,
alcohol or narcotics in any form while pupils are riding in the bus.
   (k)   All buses shall be thoroughly cleaned on the inside daily and cleaned
on the outside as often as is necessary to keep the front and rear windows,
mirrors, and markings clearly visible.

of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine or
other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of

same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician,
chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical test
or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and (d)(4)C. of this section,
“National Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.

relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible and generally accepted field sobriety

(R.C. § 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied consent.
      (1)   Definitions. For the purpose of this division (g), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device.” Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control.” Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   Tests at request of law enforcement agent. The chemical test or
tests under division (g)(2) of this section shall be administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the
person was operating or in physical control of a vehicle in violation of a
division, section or ordinance identified in division (g)(2) of this section.
The law enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate
which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to R.C. §§
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if convicted would
be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)
(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
            “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
state law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
            “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of
O.V.I., O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a
listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
under state or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under
arrest for state O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will
face increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
            (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) “If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
            “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical
test taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) of this section or division (g)(6) of this section to submit to a
chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, the arresting
officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to the court in
which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is
not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest,
and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or
permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon
receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
      (9)   Duties of officer.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.    That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that,
at the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. §
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.    That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.    Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.    Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first-class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest, provided
the report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is
sworn to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48
hours after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy
of the sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on
the charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197
relative to any suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from the
arrest covered by the report.
(R.C. § 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person’s
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person’s being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B),
or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control of a
vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or R.C. § 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) or
R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the charge resulting from
the arrest shall be held within five days of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance granted by
the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the issues specified in that
section.

within 60 days of sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the term, the offender will not be able
to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing, the court may impose an alternative sentence as specified in R.C. §
4511.19(G)(3) that includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring,

the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so
imposed shall be distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that
section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(6). The court may grant
limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under R.C. §§ 4510.021
and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition
interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of
suspension as authorized under R.C. § 4510.022. If the court grants unlimited
driving privileges under R.C. § 4510.022, the court shall suspend any jail term
imposed under division (i)(1) of this section as required under that section.
      (2)   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one or more violations of division (a)
or (b) of this section or other equivalent offense or offenses, the offender is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree. In addition to any other sanction
imposed for the offense, the court shall impose a class four suspension of the
offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction
permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range

      (3)   If the offender also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1414 and if the court
imposes a jail term for the violation of division (b) of this section, the
court shall impose upon the offender an additional definite jail term pursuant
to R.C. § 2929.24(E).
      (4)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to § 698.02
(f) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss
arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate result
of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing
the violation of division (b) of this section.
   (j)   Treatment programs.
      (1)   No court shall sentence an offender to an alcohol treatment program
under this section unless the treatment program complies with the minimum
standards for alcohol treatment programs adopted under R.C. Chapter 5119 by the
Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
      (2)   An offender who stays in a drivers’ intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an
offender who stays in an alcohol treatment program under an order issued under
this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s Indigent Drivers’ Alcohol
Treatment Fund.
   (k)   Appeal; effect on suspension. If a person whose driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended
under this section or R.C. § 4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of
the person’s trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay the operation
of the suspension.
   (l)   Exception; direction of health professional. Division (a)(1)J. of this
section does not apply to a person who operates a vehicle while the person has
a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or
urine that equals or exceeds the amount specified in that division, if both of
the following apply:
      (1)   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
      (2)   The person injected, ingested or inhaled the controlled substance
in accordance with the health professional’s directions.

controlled substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance listed in
division (a)(1)J. of this section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of
R.C. § 2923.16(D) in the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for
a prohibited concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   Applicability of terms. All terms defined in R.C. § 4510.01 apply to
this section. If the meaning of a term defined in R.C. § 4510.01 conflicts with
the meaning of the same term as defined in R.C. § 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term
as defined in R.C. § 4510.01 applies to this section.

court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (o)(3)A. of this section.
      (4)   Penalty. Whoever violates this division (o) is guilty of having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. In addition to other sanctions imposed, the court may impose on
the offender a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license
or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’

R.C. Chapter 4507 or a valid commercial driver’s license issued under R.C.
Chapter 4506. Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates

criminal contempt under R.C. § 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying
case. If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section or a

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (b)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.

that may be filed in the underlying case.
         B.   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)

determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

   339.01 OVERSIZE OR OVERWEIGHT VEHICLE OPERATION ON STATE ROUTES; STATE
PERMIT.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with R.C. §§ 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under R.C. § 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed a
nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a permit
specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be issued,
the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the vehicle
and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned upon the
sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the roadway or
a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a condition of
issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to develop and
enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate for or to
repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

a truck route and marked as such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when
such operation is necessary to load or unload property, to go to or from the
usual place of storage of such vehicle or to perform any other legitimate
business or act other than passage through the Municipality. Operators of
vehicles so deviating from either a State route or a designated truck route
within the Municipality shall confine such deviation to that required in order
to accomplish the purpose of the departure.
   (b)   Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets.
   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the Ohio
Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination of
vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction; however, the approval
of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement upon
State routes as provided in Section
339.01.
   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or for such
period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his discretion
deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction project. The Police
Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of operation for such vehicle
or combination of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed or such other
restrictions as may be necessary for the preservation of the public peace,
property, health and safety. The Police Chief may require the posting of bond
or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway or road
structure.
   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge ten dollars ($10.00),
and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by each police officer in
supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay the sum of
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per hour per officer. The charge can be prorated
into fifteen minute increments.
   Signs shall be posted to apprise drivers of the limitations imposed by this
section. Such signs shall be in accordance with the standards for traffic
control devices of the State Department of Transportation. No driver shall
disobey the instructions indicated on any such sign.
   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the permit
granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit, and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalty prescribed by
subsection (c) hereof.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second offense within one year after the first offense, the
person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on each subsequent
offense within one year after the first offense, the person is guilty of a

   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Possession” is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   “Culpability” means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
(ORC 2901.21)
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder or an offense for which
the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first degree,
to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a drug abuse
offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number of unit
doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is an
offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if that
drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number of
unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range of
controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   “Drug abuse offense.” Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      (2)   “Motor vehicle.” Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
(R.C. § 2923.02)
   501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
   501.13 CONFINEMENT COST REIMBURSEMENT.
   (a)   Any person convicted of an offense other than a minor misdemeanor and
who, as a consequence thereof, is confined at the expense of the Village of
Greenhills in any correctional facility shall reimburse the Village of
Greenhills for its expenses incurred by reason of such confinement, including,
but not limited to, expenses relating to the provision of food, clothing,
medical care and shelter. The amount of reimbursement shall be determined by a
court held pursuant to the provisions of Ohio R.C. 2929.15.
   (b)   The Village of Greenhills Law Director is hereby authorized and
directed to institute appropriate civil actions in the name of the Village of
Greenhills to recover from such a convict reimbursement for the expenses
incurred by the Village of Greenhills for his confinement as determined by a
court pursuant to the provisions of Ohio R.C. 2929.15.
(Ord. 86-17T. Passed 6-3-86.)
   501.14 ELECTRONICALLY MONITORED HOUSE ARREST.
   (a)   Any or all of the term of imprisonment authorized under the ordinances
of the Village of Greenhills may be served by means of electronically monitored
house arrest, in the sole discretion of the Mayor. In such case, the Mayor
shall determine the number of days of actual imprisonment, the number of days
of electronically monitored house arrest, and whether any of the days of actual
imprisonment shall be suspended on the condition of successful completion of
the incarceration by electronically monitored house arrest. The sum of the days
of actual imprisonment plus the days of electronically monitored house arrest
shall not exceed the stated maximum number of days of imprisonment for that
particular offense.
   (b)   No individual may serve a term of imprisonment by electronically
monitored house arrest unless he or she first executes an appropriate agreement
made available to all such defendants, whereby the defendant agrees to pay the
cost of the system (or, in the sole discretion of the Mayor, such portion of
the cost as he or she can afford to pay) and agrees to abide by all of the
rules and regulations of the electronically monitored house arrest procedure.
The agreement shall provide that no credit for suspended days of actual
incarceration shall be granted unless the defendant successfully completes all
of the days of the electronically monitored house arrest.
(Ord. 90-14TS. Passed 12-18-90.)
   (c)   No person, knowing that he or she is under the restrictions of
electronically monitored house arrest, shall purposely break or attempt to
break such detention. Whoever violates this section is guilty of contempt of
court, and shall be punished under the authority of the Mayor’s Court of the
Village of Greenhills to enforce its orders and punish for contempt.
(Ord. 91-4TS. Passed 1-29-91.)
   501.15 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (a). If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include but are not limited to the
following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim’s economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the Clerk of the Court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
imposes restitution for the cost of accounting or auditing done to determine
the extent of economic loss, the court may order restitution for any amount of
the victim’s costs of accounting or auditing provided that the amount of
restitution is reasonable and does not exceed the value of property or services
stolen or damaged as a result of the offense. If the court decides to impose
restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the
offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of restitution. If the court
holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the
burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution
sought from the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender. No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (a)(1)B.1. and
(a)(1)B.2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by
law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including but not limited to the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including but not limited to a per diem fee for room and
board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of repairing
property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (a)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (a) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under R.C. § 2929.27 in lieu of
imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court does not determine
that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term of community service
under R.C. § 2929.27 in lieu of or in addition to imposing a financial sanction
under this division (a) and in addition to imposing court costs. The court may
order community service for a minor misdemeanor pursuant to R.C. § 2929.27 in
lieu of or in addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and
in addition to imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial
sanction or court costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the
financial sanction or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (a)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (a) of
this section or of R.C. § 2929.26 or R.C. § 2929.27 or in operating a facility
used to confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under R.C. § 2929.26
to the County Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements
in the county’s General Fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the
Fund to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed
under division (a) of this section or under R.C. § 2929.26 or R.C. § 2929.27 or
in operating a facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a sanction
imposed under R.C. § 2929.26.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (a)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (a) of
this section or under R.C. § 2929.26 or R.C. § 2929.27, or in operating a
facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under R.C. §
2929.26 to the Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall
deposit the reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s General Fund. The
municipal corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the Fund to pay the
costs incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed
under division (a) of this section or under R.C. § 2929.26 or R.C. § 2929.27,
or in operating a facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a sanction
imposed under R.C. § 2929.26.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (a)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (a) of this section or under R.C.
§ 2929.26 or R.C. § 2929.27 to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (a), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. §
111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (a)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (a)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (a)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (a)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (a)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (a)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (a)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (a)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state or political subdivision may
do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (a)(5) of this section

enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (a) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (a), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §

may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (a) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
         (R.C. § 2929.28)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety

      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court's
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender's jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.
         During the offender's term in the county jail, the court retains
jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the offender's participation
in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, also
is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type described
in R.C. § 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the offender for
the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender an additional
definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional jail term shall
not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised Code. The offender
shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and prior to the jail
term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to any other
mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241
or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and any
residential sanction imposed for the violation under R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction
imposed under this division shall be considered to be a community control
sanction for purposes of R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and
the Ohio Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply
to a sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would
by their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under R.C. §§ 2929.26 or 2929.27 for
any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
         (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor Maximum Fine
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5,000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       $2,000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified $1,000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

Police, has reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction
is a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, either the Greenhills
Municipal Manager or the Greenhills Chief of Police shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
      (1)   That the Greenhills Municipal Manager or the Greenhills Chief of
Police has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as

applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed

excitement, or sado-masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the following

   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

artistic purpose.

genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.

   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02(a)(1) or (b)(1).
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, “fair market value” has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 2913.61.
   (c)   Prima facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in R.C. §
2913.61(D), may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

form prescribed by the Municipal Manager, giving the exact location of the
proposed excavation, the kind of paving, the area and depth to be excavated and

the public right of way other than those required for approved public utilities
and sewers.
   (d)   In new work, the cross slope of sidewalk shall be five-sixteenth inch
per foot and the cross slope of earth in the planting strips shall be three-
fourths inch per foot. In repair or reconstruction work, the cross slope shall
follow approximately the original sections provided that this does not result
in inadequate run-off or puddles.
   (e)   In business districts, aprons shall start one and five-eighths inches
above the paving and shall make up the remaining difference in rise in the
first three feet.
   In residence districts, the apron may start flush with the paving or flush

written notice of the additional fee incurred for the pick up to be served upon
the owner of the property notifying him that garbage or refuse was set out in

   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Ordinance

   1109.06 ADULT ENTERTAINMENT PROVISIONS.
   In adopting all of the provisions pertaining to Adult Entertainment
Facilities set forth in the Zoning Code, the Council of the Village of
Greenhills hereby states as follows:
   (a)   All such provisions are adopted to protect the public peace, health,
safety, and general welfare.
   (b)   All such provisions are adopted to combat the harmful secondary
effects associated with Adult Entertainment Facilities. The Village hereby
recognizes and specifically relies upon the studies of the harmful secondary
effects of Adult Entertainment Facilities, and all other recitations of those
secondary effects, set forth in the United States Supreme Court's decisions in
Renton v. Playtime Theatres, 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini
Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50 (1976), Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560
(1991), and all other applicable case law. See City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., ___
U.S. ___ (2000). Based on its review of those decisions and its familiarity
with the Village as a whole, Council believes that the harmful secondary
effects set forth in the foregoing decisions are relevant to the Adult
Entertainment Facilities which the Village regulates in this Zoning Code.
   (c)   Council finds that the harmful secondary effects associated with Adult
Entertainment Facilities are detrimental to the public peace, health, safety,
and general welfare.
   (d)   No such provision is adopted to regulate, limit, or suppress the
content or flow of speech or free expression. Any limitation on speech or
expression which results from the provisions of this Zoning Code's regulation
of Adult Entertainment Facilities is unintended and purely incidental to the
Village's attempt to combat the harmful secondary effects of Adult
Entertainment Facilities.

   (a)   The districts established in Section
1113.01 are shown on the Zoning Map which, together with all explanatory matter
therein, is hereby adopted as part of this Zoning Code and is hereby
incorporated by reference into this Zoning Code. The Zoning Map, properly
attested, shall remain on file in the office of the Municipal Manager or his/

the time of adoption of this Chapter, but where a district line obviously does
not coincide with the lot lines as such, or center lines of streets or alleys,
or where it is not designated by dimensions, it shall be determined by the use
of an engineer's scale as measured on the Zoning Map.
   (b)   When the streets or alleys on the ground differ from the streets or
alleys on the Zoning Map, the Board of Appeals may apply the Zoning District
designations on the map to the property on the ground in such a manner as to
conform to the intent and purposes of this Section in the judgment of the
Board. However, under no circumstances shall any areas within the Greenbelt
District be eliminated or reduced because of any district boundary
interpretation.
(Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13.)

by annexation shall automatically be classed as lying and being in the same
District as it was designated by the adjacent jurisdiction, if there be a
similar District in existence under these regulations; insofar as the use, area
and height of buildings erected thereon can fit into a similar zone, such
District shall be applied. If no such use or District is available, then such
portion annexed shall automatically be classified as lying and being in the "R-
1" Residence District until such classification shall have been changed by an
amendment to the Zoning Map, as provided for by law.

   Unless a variance is specifically granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals, no
lot, yard, court, parking area or other space shall be reduced in area or
dimension so as to make the area or dimension less than the minimum required by
this Code. No part of a yard, court, parking area or other space provided about
or for any building or structure for the purpose of complying with the
provisions of this Chapter, shall be included as part of the yard, court,
parking area or other space required under this Chapter for another building or

(Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13.)
   1115.02 CLEAR SIGHT DISTANCE AT STREET AND ACCESS DRIVE INTERSECTIONS AND
CORNER LOTS.
   To insure that landscape materials do not constitute a driving hazard, a
"clear sight triangle" will be observed at all street and access drive
intersections. A clear sight triangle is the triangular area formed by a
diagonal line connecting two points located on intersecting lines of a right-
of-way, easement of access, or pavement edge of an access drive, each point
being 20 feet from the intersecting lines. See Figure 1115.02A.
   (a)   Design.  The entire area of the clear sight triangle should be
designed as illustrated in Figure 1115.02A to provide the drive of the vehicle
entering the intersection with an unobstructed view to all points nine (9) feet
above the roadway along the centerline. The recommended distance depends upon
the design speed of the higher-order street and therefore is greater for
arterial streets than for collectors.
   (b)   Restrictions Within Clear Sight Triangles. Within the sight triangle
no landscape material with a mature height greater than twelve inches (12")
shall be permitted with the exception of trees which conform to the following
standards. Trees shall be permitted within the sight triangles as long as,
except during early growth stages, only the tree trunk (no limbs, leaves, etc.)
is visible between the ground and nine (9) feet above the ground, or otherwise
does not present a traffic visibility hazard. Restrictions shall not apply to
the following:
      (1)   Existing natural grades which, by reason of natural topography,
rise twelve (12) or more inches above the level of the center of the adjacent
intersection;
      (2)   Fire hydrants, public utility poles, street markers, governmental

      (3)   If a cellular or wireless communications company can demonstrate
that there are no suitable sites under industry or engineering standards for
its cellular or wireless communications site within the B-1 or B-2 zoning
districts, the company may apply for a permit to place the tower or antenna in
a residential district.
To apply for such a permit, the communications company must submit an
application, a preliminary site plan, and a rendering of the proposed tower to
the Municipal Manager or a designated representative. A permit to place a tower
or antenna within a residential district shall only be granted if the proposed
site meets each of the following conditions:
         A.   The lot size of the proposed site is no less than three acres;
and
         B.   The proposed tower will have a minimum set back of 200 feet from
the base of the tower or any guy wire anchors to the property line. However, if
one of the property lines of the proposed site abuts a B-1 or B-2 district, the
minimal setback from the property line which abuts the B-1 or B-2 district
shall be determined in accordance with subsection (f)(2); and
         C.   The proposed site is on a lot which is currently used for an
institutional purpose such as a school, church, playfield, park, golf course or
other similar use.
      (4)   A cellular or wireless communications antenna may be mounted to an
existing structure, such as a communications tower (whether said tower is for
cellular or wireless purposes or not), smoke stack, water tower or other tall
structures in any B- 1 or B-2 zoning district or in a residential district if a
permit has been granted as provided in subsection (c)(3). Cellular or wireless
communication antenna may only be placed on the top of buildings that are no
less than thirty-five feet in height.
      (5)   Micro antennas not exceeding five feet in height may be placed on
any buildings in a B-1 or B-2 zoning district or on certain lots in a
residential district which meets the conditions in subsection (d)(3) hereof.
      (6)   All other uses accessory to the cellular or wireless communications

depots, and materials and vehicle storage, are prohibited from the site unless
otherwise permitted in the zoning district in which the cellular or wireless
communications antenna and/or tower is located.
   (e)   Standards of Approval for Cellular or Wireless Communications Antennas
and Towers. The following standards shall apply to all cellular or wireless
communications antennas and towers:
      (1)   The cellular or wireless communications company shall be required
to demonstrate, using the latest technological evidence, that the antenna or
tower must be placed where it is proposed in order to satisfy its necessary
function in the company's grid system. Part of this demonstration shall include
a drawing showing the boundaries of the area around the proposed location which
would also properly permit the antenna to function properly in the company's
grid system. This area shall be considered the allowable zone.
      (2)   If the communications company proposes to build a cellular or
wireless communications tower (as opposed to mounting the antenna on an
existing structure), it is required to demonstrate that it has contacted the
owners of nearby tall structures within the allowable zone, asked for
permission to install the cellular communications antenna on those structures,
and was denied for reasons other than economic ones. "Tall structures" shall
include, but not be limited to: smoke stacks, water towers, buildings over
thirty-five feet in height, antenna support structures or other cellular or
wireless communication companies, other communication towers.
The Village may deny the application to construct a new cellular or wireless
communications tower if the applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount
the antenna on existing structures.
   (f)   Requirements of All Cellular or Wireless Communications Antennas and
Towers.
      (1)   Antenna/Tower Height. The applicant shall demonstrate that the
antenna/tower is the minimum height required to function satisfactorily and to
accommodate the collocation requirements as set out in subsection (f). No
antenna that is taller than the minimum height shall be approved. Cellular or
wireless communication towers shall be exempt from the maximum height
requirements contained in the Sections
1131.09  and
1133.09  of the Zoning Code. Cellular towers shall be monopole construction
unless it is demonstrated that another type of tower is required for safety
purposes.
      (2)   Setbacks from the Base of the Tower.  If a new cellular or wireless
communications tower is to be constructed, the minimum distance between the
base of the tower or any guy wire anchors and any property line which abuts a
zoning district other than a residential district shall be no closer than the
greater of the following:
         A.   Forty percent (40%) of the tower height;
         B.   The minimum setback in the underlying zoning district; or
         C.   Fifty (50) feet.
      (3)   Cellular or Wireless Communications Tower Safety.
         A.   All cellular or wireless communications towers shall be fitted

other debris, electromagnetic fields or radio frequency interference. However,
if a specific safety issue in question is determined to be regulated by either
FCC Regulations or applicable Building Code Regulations, and the operation or
construction is in compliance with such regulations, then this requirement for
safety shall be deemed to have been met.
         B.   Subsequent to the installation of a cellular or wireless
communications tower site, if it is determined by the Village Council, upon
presentation of proper and sufficient documentation, and after a public
hearing, that the operation of a cellular or wireless communications tower is
inherently dangerous or is a demonstrable health hazard, the cellular or

   It is the intent of this chapter to accommodate creative and imaginative
Planned Unit Developments and to permit those innovations in land development
which are in the best interest of the Village. In order to accomplish this
intent, it is the purpose of this chapter:
   (a)   To encourage, in a Planned Unit Development (PUD), a variety of
architectural designs, structural techniques and types of structures in a
maximum density permitted within the district in which the Planned Unit
Development is proposed;
   (b)   To encourage the flexible spacing of lots and buildings in order to
encourage separation of pedestrian and vehicular circulation, the conservation
of natural amenities of the landscape, and the provision of readily accessible
common open space areas where appropriate;
   (c)   To encourage residential uses that result in an improvement to the
housing stock of the Village as it relates to building size, architectural
character and the introduction of housing choices currently not available in
the Village.
   (d)   To encourage mixed uses (i.e. residential/commercial) where the
Planned Unit Development includes the appropriate underlying zone districts.
      (Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13.)
   1141.02 USE REGULATIONS.
   Village Council may permit the following uses in a Planned Unit Development:
   (a)   Any use permitted in the Zoning Code for the particular property which
is the subject of the Planned Unit Development application. A Planned Unit
Development which includes more than a single zoning district within its
boundaries may be approved as a mixed use Planned Unit Development where the
Planning Commission and Council determine that the mix is compatible with the
surrounding uses.
   (b)   In residential Planned Unit Developments, accessory services or
associated uses such as private garages, storage spaces, community facilities
and schools to service the occupants of the Planned Unit Development may also
be permitted as appropriate and clearly incidental to the uses permitted on the
same premises, or such other uses as approved by the Planning Commission and
Council and designed to serve primarily the occupants of the Planned Unit
Development.
   (c)   Open space which may include land, water or a combination of both, and
along with the natural environmental features, swimming pools, tennis courts,
other recreational facilities and complementary structures and improvements
deemed permissible by the Planning Commission and Council. These facilities are
to be used mainly by the occupants of the development in which the facilities
are located and their guests. Streets, parking lots, structures for habitation
or storage and the like shall not be included as part of the required open
space and recreational facilities. (Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13.)
   1141.03 AREA, DENSITY AND LOT REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Area for Development.  The minimum area for a Planned Unit Development
shall be 1 acre. All land within the development shall be contiguous in that it
shall not be divided into segments by any tract of land (other than streets or
rights of way for pipelines or electric transmission lines) not owned by the
developer of the Planned Unit Development.
   (b)   Maximum Density. A Planned Unit Development shall not exceed the
densities prescribed for the district in which it is located. The permitted
density shall be determined by the average number of units per net acre, as
determined by the minimum lot sizes in the respective districts.
   (c)   Minimum Requirements.
      (1)   Yard setback, height controls, type of dwelling unit, frontage, use
and parking restrictions contained in other chapters of this Zoning Code are
hereby waived for Planned Unit Developments, provided that the intent and
objectives of this chapter are implemented in the total development plan, as
determined by the Planning Commission and Council. Building separation shall be
maintained in accordance with the requirements of the Fire Code and other
safety codes of the Village and the State.
      (2)   Every building shall have access to a public street, internal
walkway, internal street or other area dedicated to common use.
   (d)   Perimeter Requirements. If topographical or other barriers within the
development do not provide reasonable privacy for the existing uses adjacent to
the development, the Planning Commission and Council may impose either of the
following requirements, or both:
      (1)   Structures located on the perimeter of the development shall be set
back in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code unless modified by
the Planning Commission or Council as part of the Preliminary Plan Approval
process; and
      (2)   Structures located on the perimeter shall be well screened in a
manner approved by the Planning Commission and Council.
         (Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13.)
   1141.04 STREETS.
   (a)   Interior public streets shall be paved according to the Village's
street design standards. Interior private streets shall be properly lighted and
maintained. The minimum paved roadway for private streets in a residential
Planned Unit Development shall be as follows:
      (1)   Two-way road with parking on one side where approved - twenty-four
feet;
      (2)   One-way road with parking on one side where approved - twenty feet;
      (3)   One-way road without parking - fifteen feet; and
      (4)   Alleys with parking on one side - eighteen feet.
   Parking along access roads shall be subject to the approval of Council and
the Municipal Manager or authorized representative appointed by the Manager. In
business or industrial Planned Unit Developments, the above minimum right-of-
way widths shall be increased in accordance with the requirements of Council.
   (b)   Collector streets and major thoroughfares shall be designated as such
by the developer upon submission of the general plans as provided for
hereafter. Such designations shall be subject to modification by the Planning
Commission and Council so that an efficient circulation system is established
in relation to other existing or planned streets in the area. There shall be no
access from a structure in the Planned Unit Development directly to a major
thoroughfare, and direct access from individual structures or lots to collector
streets shall be minimized.
   (c)   Off-street parking shall be provided outside the public or private
right of way sufficient to accommodate the normal uses of any structure
consistent with the requirements of Chapter 1147, and those persons who live or
are employed on the premises as well as their social or business invitees.
Screening of parking or service areas may be required through the use of such
devices as are determined by the Planning Commission and Council. All parking
spaces and service drives shall comply with the regulations contained in
Chapter 1147.
(Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13.)
   1141.05 COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   (a)   All Planned Unit Developments must contain common open space area(s),
the amount of which is required shall be determined by the Planning Commission
and Council and shall be a function of the nature of the development and the
avoidance of adverse impacts or blighting influences upon neighboring uses as
well as consideration for improvements to the existing vehicular parking
situation in the immediate vicinity of the PUD site. Such open space shall be
clearly shown on the Preliminary and Final Plans, and shall be physically
situated so as to be readily accessible, available to and useful to all
occupants of the Planned Unit Development.
   (b)   All common space shown on the Preliminary and Final Plans and recorded
with the County Recorder shall be conveyed in accordance with one of the
following methods:
      (1)   By dedication to the Village as publicly owned and maintained open
space. All common open space for dedication to the Village shall be acceptable
to the Planning Commission and Council with regard to size, shape, location and
improvement. In addition, the developer shall show that the dedication of such
areas will be for the benefit of the general public of the Village.
      (2)   By leasing or conveying title (including beneficial ownership) to a
corporation, occupants' association, trust or other legal entity. In the terms
of such lease or other instrument of conveyance, provisions shall be included
which are suitable to the Planning Commission and Council for guaranteeing: the
continued use of such land for intended purposes; continuity of property
maintenance; when appropriate, the availability of funds required for such
maintenance, adequate insurance protection; and recovery for loss sustained by
causality, condemnation or otherwise. In any event, the developer shall file
with the County Recorder at the time the approved final development plan is
filed, legal documents which shall produce the aforesaid guarantees and, in
particular, shall provide a method for restricting use of common open space for
designated purposes.
         (Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13.)
   1141.06 PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION.
   The pedestrian circulation system and its related walkways shall be
insulated as completely and as reasonably as possible from the vehicular street
system, exclusive of any alley, in order to provide separation of pedestrian
and vehicular movement.
(Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13.)
   1141.07 UTILITIES.
   The Planning Commission and Council shall have the authority to require the
provision of underground installation of utilities in Planned Unit
Developments. Utility installation and maintenance of facilities shall be in
accordance with Village requirements and regulations. A Planned Unit
Development shall not be approved unless adequate assurance is given that
adequate public or central water and sanitary sewers shall be available at the
first occupancy.
(Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13.)
   1141.08 PRIVACY IN RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   Each residential Planned Unit Development shall provide reasonable visual
and acoustical privacy so that the occupants of one unit shall not interfere
with the activities of occupants of another unit, unless specifically designed
otherwise and approved as such by the Planning Commission and Council. Fences,
insulation, walls, barriers and landscaping shall be used as appropriate, for
the protection and aesthetic enhancement of property, the privacy of its
occupants, screening of objectionable views or uses and the reduction of
noises.
(Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13.)
   1141.09 ESTABLISHMENT OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   Planned Unit Developments may be established either by a determination of
the Planning Commission and Council that a particular piece of property shall
be developed under this chapter, or by approval of an application from a
property owner. Sections
1141.10  to
1141.13  regulate how all Planned Unit Developments are to be reviewed.

consent of the developer and the Planning Commission. Council shall consider
the report from the Planning Commission and shall have sixty days from the date
on which it receives the report from the Planning Commission to consider and to
approve, deny or approve with modifications the Final Plan, provided that time
may be extended by mutual consent of the developer and the Village. Council
shall approve the application if it finds that the following conditions are
met:
      (1)   The Final Plan accurately sets forth the area to be developed, the
area to be set aside as open space with appropriate boundaries established by
courses and distances, the quantity of land within the area to be approved and
the quantity of land to be set aside as open space for the use of all occupants
of the area;
      (2)   The Final Plan is substantially in accordance with the Preliminary
Plan which has been previously filed with the Planning Commission and approved

space required under the Preliminary Plan previously filed with the Planning
Commission and approved by Village Council;
      (5)   The Developer submits an amount in escrow or provides a performance
bond to the Village to secure its obligations to complete the public
improvements as set forth in the Final Plan. The amount of any such escrow
deposit or performance bond shall be as established by the Village Council in
connection with approval of the Final Plan;
      (6)   For phased projects already underway, satisfactory progress has
been made in previously approved segments with respect to the provision and
improvement of indicated recreational facilities; and
      (7)   The Final Plan accurately sets forth a schedule demonstrating
proportionate development of the open space and recreational facilities in
conjunction with the total project. A performance bond may be allowed to
substitute for actual construction of recreational facilities. Any such
construction covered by a performance bond shall be completed within one year.
The amenities included in each phase shall be, in effect, completed prior to
the issuance of occupancy permits.
         (Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13.)
   1141.13 RECORDING.

occurred in compliance with the approved and recorded Final Plan.
(Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13.)
   1141.16 FAILURE TO BEGIN.
   (a)   If no construction has begun in the Planned Unit Development within
one year from the approval of the Final Plan for the overall project or any
part thereof and the recording of the necessary documents as outlined in
Section
1141.13 has not occurred, approval of the Final Plan shall lapse and be of no
further effect. The Planning Commission, for good cause, may extend for periods
of up to one year, the time for beginning construction.
   (b)   If an approved Final Plan shall lapse, as provided herein, a record of
such lapse shall be recorded by the Planning Commission and thereafter such
approval shall be considered as having been revoked.
   (c)   Nothing herein shall be considered as effecting such lapse and
revocation if the developer commences construction. If construction commences,
the Final Plan may be modified only in accordance with Section
1141.17.
(Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13.)
   1141.17 REVISION OF APPROVED FINAL PLAN.
   (a)   The development shall conform to the approved Final Plan. The
applicant, his successors and assignees shall make no alterations, additions or
deletions with respect to the Final Plan, the related documents, or to the
site, except that the Planning Commission may authorize minor changes.
   (b)   An alteration, addition or deletion with respect to the Final Plan
will be deemed to be a "minor change" if the Planning Commission determines
that such alteration, addition or deletion does not represent a departure from
the intent of, or a major departure from the substance of, the Final Plan. For
purposes of this Section, a "major departure from the substance of a Final
Plan" may include, but is not limited to, an increase in or relocation of areas
planned for a particular use or the addition of a use not included in the
approved Final Plan.
   (c)   Upon approval of a Final Plan, changes other than minor changes
approved by the Planning Commission may be made pursuant to a new submission,
beginning with a Preliminary Plan, of a Planned Unit Development application,
which shall be processed and approved in accordance with this chapter. (Ord.
2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13.)
   1141.18 PHASING.
   The establishment of common open spaces, the construction of public or
common recreational facilities shown on the recorded Final Plan and the
construction of other non-residential structures shall proceed substantially in
accordance with the phasing program referred to in Section
1141.10, Preliminary Plan Submission, herein. After general construction
commences, the developer shall submit progress reports annually to the Planning
Commission, which shall review all building permits issued and compare them to
the overall development phasing program. If it is determined that the rate of
construction of units substantially differs from the phasing program, the
Planning Commission shall notify the developer in writing. Thereafter, the
Village can take such action as it may against any other violators of this
Zoning Code.
(Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13.)
   1141.19 VIOLATION.

in the case of any approved Final Plan that any of the terms, conditions or
restrictions upon which Final Plan approval, Section
1141.12 herein, was granted, are not being complied with, the Planning
Commission or Council by ordinance, may rescind and revoke such approval.
Notice thereof shall be the same as that required for a zoning amendment.
   (b)   Violation of the Final Plan for a Planned Unit Development as approved
shall constitute violation of the Zoning Code.

   (a)   (1)   The purpose of this Chapter is to preserve and protect historic
properties in the Village of Greenhills, and any subsequently designated local
historic landmarks, historic district(s), contributing buildings, and historic
sites. In order to preserve and protect the historic character of existing and
future historic districts and/or local historic landmarks, the regulations of
this Chapter are imposed in addition to other zoning regulations contained in
the Zoning Code and thus comprise an overlay of additional regulations.
      (2)   The provisions of this Chapter shall control and supersede,
wherever inconsistent with other existing provisions of the Zoning Code, all
regulations of the underlying zone district. Otherwise, all existing provisions
of the Zoning Code shall remain in full force and effect and shall govern all
proposed land uses and development except as supplemented by this Chapter.
   (b)   The character of the Village is directly linked to the economic,
social, historical, and cultural health and well-being of the community. This
Chapter, therefore, establishes procedures to maintain the historic character
of select local historic landmarks and/or districts within the Village and
obtain the following objectives:
      (1)   To maintain and enhance the Greenhills Comprehensive Plan and
safeguard the Village's attractions to prospective residents, businesses and
visitors by preserving the distinctive character of historic local historic
landmarks and/or districts.
      (2)   To safeguard the architectural integrity of the Village's local
historic landmark buildings and allow for future addition of local historic
landmarks and/or districts.
      (3)   To safeguard the heritage of the Village by preserving sites,
buildings, objects, landscapes and works of art that reflect elements of the
Village's cultural, social, economic, political or architectural heritage.
      (4)   To seek alternatives to demolition or incompatible alterations of
local historic landmarks and/or districts within the Village before such acts
are performed.
      (5)   To afford the widest possible scope of continuing vitality through
private renewal and architectural creativity within appropriate controls and
standards.
      (6)   To encourage the use or appropriate development of vacant
properties, as applicable, in accordance with the character of local historic
landmarks and/or districts.
      (7)   To combat urban blight caused by neglect of aging buildings, sites
and districts and their setting.
      (8)   To encourage investment in historic resources and strengthening of
the Village's economy.
      (9)   To enhance the environmental and aesthetic quality of the Village.
      (10)   To stabilize and improve property values.
      (11)   To promote preservation and continued use of historic public
buildings such as the Greenhills Community Building and Marquardt-Whallon
House.
      (12)   To protect public health, safety, prosperity, and welfare.
   (c)   It is the further intent of this section to discourage the subdivision
of lots in ways that would conflict with the historic patterns of development
in historic district(s).

   1143.06 REGULATIONS FOR REVIEWING APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   Limitations on Issuance of Building and Demolition Permits. No
construction, reconstruction, addition, demolition or removal of any building
or significant exterior architectural feature thereof to any listed local
historic landmark, contributing building, or any other structure within an
historic district shall be undertaken prior to obtaining a Certificate of
Appropriateness from the Planning Commission and a Certificate of Zoning
Compliance from the Zoning Official, if applicable. No Certificate of Zoning
Compliance
shall be issued by the Zoning Official for the construction, addition,
demolition or removal of a listed local historic landmark, contributing
building or non-contributing building or historic site in or outside of an
historic district, except in cases falling within the exclusion set forth in
this section, unless the application for such permit is approved by the
Planning Commission through the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness in
the manner prescribed herein.
   (b)   Certificate of Appropriateness.
      (1)   Applicability.
         A.   When the owner of a listed local historic landmark, contributing
building or non-contributing building or historic site intends to construct,
reconstruct, alter or demolish any exterior architectural feature of such
building or an accessory building exceeding 150 square feet in floor area
located on the same lot as the local historic landmark, contributing or non-
contributing building, unless said accessory building is designated as an
historic site, or when the owner intends to subdivide the lot, they shall first
apply for and secure a Certificate of Appropriateness. A Certificate of
Appropriateness is required for any exterior change to the building or its
property, as otherwise regulated by this section.
         B.   The application for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be
filed with the Zoning Official with such plans, specifications, and other
materials as the Village requires, on such forms provided by that Department.
      (2)   Procedure.
         A.   Once an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness is filed
with the Zoning Official, it shall be scheduled on the agenda of the next
available meeting of the Planning Commission, except, however, that such
application shall have a hearing within 45 days of the receipt of the completed
application and necessary attachments by the Village. The Zoning Official shall
notify the applicant and adjoining property owners of the hearing date. At the
hearing, the Planning Commission shall approve the application or make
suggestions to modify the application for approval at its next meeting.
         B.   Within 30 days after the hearing is closed, the Planning
Commission shall file a report approving the Certificate of Appropriateness,
approving the Certificate of Appropriateness with conditions, or denying the
application and shall provide a copy of that report to the applicant.
         C.   If the application is not heard by the Planning Commission within
45 days or no report is filed within 30 days after the hearing, the Certificate
of Appropriateness shall be considered approved by the Planning Commission.
         D.   An application shall be deemed filed only when it contains the
plans, specifications, and other materials prescribed by the Village.
         E.   A denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness application may be
appealed to Village Council according to the provisions of Section
1143.07.
      (3)   Standards and Guidelines for Reviewing Applications.
         A.   Standards. In considering an application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness, the Planning Commission shall be guided by the following
Standards, which are based on the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for
Rehabilitation. These standards pertain to buildings of all occupancy and
construction types, sizes and materials. They apply to permanent or temporary
construction on the exterior as well as new, attached or adjacent construction.
However, not all of the Standards will apply to each proposed project.
            1.   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible
use for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building,
structure, or site and its environment or to use a property for its originally
intended purpose.
            2.   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a
property shall be retained and preserved. The removal or alteration of any
historic material or distinctive architectural feature shall be avoided when
possible.
            3.   All properties shall be recognized as products of their own
time. Changes that have no historical basis and seek to create an earlier
appearance, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from
other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
            4.   Changes that may have taken place over time are evidence of
the history and development of a property. These changes may have acquired
significance in their own right and such significance shall be recognized and
respected.
            5.   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled
craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be treated with sensitivity.
            6.   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather
than replaced wherever possible. If replacement is necessary, then the new
feature should match the feature being replaced in composition, design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Repair or
replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate
duplications of features substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial
evidence rather than conjectural designs or the availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
            7.   The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be
undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other abrasive or
high-pressure cleaning methods that will damage historic building materials
shall not be used.
            8.   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project.
            9.   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historic, architectural or cultural material and when such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property and its environment.
            10.   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures
shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic
property would be unimpaired.
         B.   Recommended Techniques, Treatments and Methods. Specific
information on recommended techniques, treatments and methods may be found in
Illustrated Guidelines for the Treatment of Historic Properties, Preservation
Briefs and other technical publications published by the Technical Preservation
Services Division of the National Park Service. These are available through the
NPS website, www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps or the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
         C.   Supplemental Guidelines. The Planning Commission may supplement
the Standards by issuing supplemental guidelines. These guidelines are meant to
assure that any alteration of historic properties preserves and protects the
historic character of those resources. These guidelines shall be submitted to
the Village Council for review and approval prior to their becoming effective.
Once approved, these guidelines shall be made available by the Village to
interested parties in order to provide them guidance in designing work and
submitting requests. Planning Commission shall review and update the
supplemental guidelines during the first Planning Commission meeting of each
year and then immediately submit same to the Village Council for approval.
   (c)   Demolition.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall consider the following criteria in
evaluating applications for demolition of a historic property.
         A.   Economic hardship. The owner can demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the Planning Commission that preservation of the historic property will
cause substantial economic hardship for the applicant, as defined in Section
1143.07.
         B.   Non-significant elements. The demolition request is for an
inappropriate addition or a non-significant portion of a historic property and
the demolition will not adversely affect those parts of the historic property
that are significant as determined by the Planning Commission.
         C.   Non-contributing buildings. Non-contributing buildings may be
demolished if the demolition will not adversely affect the character of the
district. Any new construction on the cleared site will be subject to the
applicable guidelines per Section
1143.06(b)(3).
      (2)   The Planning Commission's determination on a proposed demolition of
a historic property shall be based upon a balance of the foregoing criteria
with the burden upon the applicant to establish that he or she is entitled to a
Certificate of Appropriateness. In making any such determination, the
Commission shall be guided by the principle that the demolition of a historic
property constitutes an irreplaceable loss. The reasoning of the Planning
Commission in reaching any such decision and the results of its balancing of
the foregoing criteria shall be clearly stated either in the minutes of the
proceeding or in a separate written report.
      (3)   If an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness seeks
approval of demolition of a historic property, the Planning Commission may
delay determination of the application for a period of up to 180 days upon a
finding that the historic property is of such importance that alternatives to
demolition may be feasible and should be actively pursued by both the applicant
and the Planning Commission.
         A.   In the event that action on an application is delayed as provided
herein, the Planning Commission, or its designated committee, may take such
steps as it deems necessary to preserve the structure in accordance with the
purposes of this ordinance. Such steps may include but are not limited to,
consultation with civic groups, public agencies and interested citizens,
marketing plans, recommendation for acquisition of the property by public or
private bodies or agencies and exploration of the possibility of moving the
historic building or other significant features of the historic property.
         B.   Upon the imposition of a waiting period, the Planning Commission,
or its designated committee, shall undertake meaningful and continuing
discussions during the waiting period in order to find a means of preserving
the historic property. The commission and the applicant shall investigate the
feasibility of all means of preserving the historic property. During this
period the commission and the applicant shall make every reasonable effort to
find a feasible alternative to demolition for the historic property. If the
Planning Commission finds that a feasible alternative to demolition exists,
then the certificate of appropriateness for demolition shall be denied. The
Planning Commission shall give written notice to the applicant when the
Planning Commission believes that the structure may be saved if the applicant
agrees to a longer waiting period.
(Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13; Ord. 2020-04-CD. Passed 12- 8-20.)
   1143.07 ECONOMIC HARDSHIP.
   (a)   If preservation of a historic property may result in substantial
economic hardship, the applicant may submit evidence for consideration by the
Planning Commission. Substantial economic hardship does not include an
applicant's inability to maximize the return on his or her investment.
Deterioration of a historic property due to neglect by its owner does not
create the basis for a finding of substantial economic hardship.
   (b)   The Planning Commission shall consider the following criteria to
determine the existence of substantial economic hardship:
      (1)   Denial of a certificate will result in a substantial reduction in
the economic value of the property.
      (2)   Denial of a certificate will result in a substantial economic
burden on the applicant because the applicant cannot reasonably maintain the
property in its current form.
      (3)   No reasonable alternative exists consistent with the architectural
standards and guidelines for the property.
      (4)   The owner has been unable to sell the property using best efforts.
   (c)   Documentation of Economic Hardship.  To prove economic hardship the
applicant shall submit sufficient information to enable the Planning Commission
to make an accurate assessment of economic conditions affecting the
application. In considering cases of economic hardship the Planning Commission
may solicit expert testimony or request that the applicant submit any items it
needs, including but not limited to the items below. The level of documentation
may vary as appropriate to each case; however, the Planning Commission's
assessment shall be based solely on the property's economic fundamentals and
not the financial capacity of the owner.
      (1)   Alternative uses and the economic return they will earn in relation
to the following:
         A.   Estimate of the cost of the proposed redevelopment, alteration,
demolition or removal and an estimate of any additional cost that would be
incurred to comply with the recommendations of the Planning Commission for
changes necessary for the continued use of the property and the issuance of a
Certificate of Appropriateness.
         B.   A report from a licensed engineer or architect with experience in
rehabilitation as to the structural soundness of any buildings on the property
and their suitability for rehabilitation including any existing evidence that
deterioration has progressed to the extent that rehabilitation is not
practical;
         C.   Estimated market value of the property in its current condition;
after completion of the proposed redevelopment, alteration, demolition or
removal; and after changes recommended by the Planning Commission for the
renovation of the existing property for continued use;
         D.   Testimony from a third party architect, developer, appraiser or
other real estate professional experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic
feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of existing buildings on the property
taking into consideration any existing evidence that deterioration has
progressed to the extent that rehabilitation is not practical.
      (2)   The current economic return on the property in relation to the
following:
         A.   The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase, and the
party from whom purchased, including a description of the relationship, if any,
between the owner of record or applicant and the person from whom the historic
property was purchased;
         B.   If the property is income-producing, the annual gross income from
the property for the previous two years; itemized operating and maintenance
expenses for the previous two years; and depreciation deduction and annual cash
flow after debt service, if any, during the same period;
         C.   Real estate taxes for the previous two years and assessed value
of the property according to the most recent assessed valuation;
         D.   All appraisals obtained within the previous two years by the
owner or applicant in connection with the purchase, financing or ownership of
the property.
      (3)   The property is not able to be sold, considered in relation to any
listing of the property for sale or rent, price asked, and offers received, if
any, within the previous two years, including testimony and relevant documents
regarding:
         A.   Any real estate broker or firm engaged to sell or lease the
property;
         B.   Reasonableness of the price or rent sought by the applicant;
         C.   Any advertisements placed for sale or rent of the property;
      (4)   Economic incentives and/or funding available to the applicant
through federal, state, city or private programs.
         (Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13.)
   1143.08 MINIMUM MAINTENANCE REQUIRED.
   (a)   No owner of a historic property shall by action(s) or willful neglect,
fail to provide sufficient and reasonable care, maintenance and upkeep to
ensure the property's perpetuation and to prevent its destruction by
deterioration or demolition by neglect. Deterioration of a historic property
due to action(s) or willful neglect by its owner does not create the basis for
a finding of substantial economic hardship. Factors demonstrating willful
neglect include the following:
      (1)   Duration of ownership,
      (2)   Physical condition of the historic property,
      (3)   Deterioration or loss of significant architectural features,
      (4)   Official Village correspondence with the owner in regard to
maintenance and record of citations as a public nuisance in accordance with
Chapter 1323 of the Greenhills Building Code.
   (b)   If it is determined by the Planning Commission a historic property is
threatened with willful neglect, the Board may take any of the following
actions:
      (1)   The Planning Commission may request updates on maintenance activity
of historic properties from the Zoning Official related to all applicable
provisions of Chapter 1323 of the Greenhills Building Code.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may request the Zoning Official to notify,
in writing, the property owner(s), of the Board's finding of unlawful neglect
of the property. The notice shall specify the minimum items of repair or
maintenance necessary to correct or prevent further deterioration or demolition
from neglect as well as a reasonable time period in which to complete those
items of repair or maintenance. This provision shall be in addition to all
applicable provisions of Chapter 1323 of the Greenhills Building Code.
      (3)   The Planning Commission may, on its own initiative, file a petition

         (Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-3-12.)
   1145.05 BUFFERYARD STANDARDS.
   (a)   Maintenance of Landscaping and Bufferyards. All landscaping materials
shall be installed and maintained according to accepted nursery industry
procedures. The owner of the property shall be responsible for the continued
property maintenance of all landscaping materials, and shall keep them in a
proper, neat and orderly appearance, free from refuse and debris at all times.
All unhealthy or dead plant material shall be replaced within one year, or by
the next planting period, whichever comes first. Violation of these
installation and maintenance provisions shall be grounds for the Zoning
Official to refuse a building occupancy permit, require replacement of the
landscape material or institute legal proceedings to enforce the provisions of
this Section.
   (b)   Bufferyard Establishment. Once a bufferyard has been approved by the
Planning Commission and established by the owner, it may not be used, disturbed
or altered for any purpose.
   (c)   Quality and Installation.  
      (1)   All specifications for the quality and installation of trees and
shrubs shall be in accordance with the most recent edition of "American
Standards for Nursery Stock" published by the American Association of
Nurserymen.
      (2)   All plant material shall be free from disease and damage.
      (3)   All plant material shall be planted in a manner that is not
intrusive to utilities, pavement, pedestrian traffic or vehicular traffic.
      (4)   All required plant material shall be planted within one year or by
the next planting season, as outlined in the latest edition of "American
Standards for Nursery Stock", after all construction activity in the area of
the new planting has ceased.
   (d)   Size.
      (1)   Canopy Trees shall be deciduous trees with a minimum of twelve feet
(12') overall height or a minimum caliper of 2 ½ inches when installed, and
have an expected height of at least thirty-five (35') feet at maturity.
      (2)   Evergreen Trees shall be a minimum of five feet (5') in height when
installed.
      (3)   Understory Trees shall be a minimum of five feet (5') in height in
clump form or 1 ½ inch caliper in single stem form when installed.
      (4)   Shrubs shall be at least eighteen inches (18") in height or twenty-
four inches (24") in spread when installed.
   (e)   Screens. The objective of providing a screen is to visually hide
whatever is behind the screen. The screen shall be 100% opaque. The following
standards for each screening material shall be required.
      (1)   Plant Material Height Requirements. When plant material is used as
screening it shall meet all height requirements in accordance with this
Chapter. Height requirements will be considered met when plants are selected
whose height at maturity as certified by a licensed Landscape Architect or
Certified Horticulturist complies with the requirements of this Chapter.
      (2)   Planting Requirements. To be counted towards screening
requirements, evergreen trees and evergreen shrubs shall be planted close
enough to fulfill the objective as defined in this Section. Recommended spacing
to achieve this is as follows:
         A.   Spreading evergreen trees should be planted eight feet (8') on
center. Narrow evergreen trees should be planted four feet (4') on center.
Designations of evergreen trees as spreading or narrow shall be certified by a
licensed Landscape Architect or certified Horticulturist.
         B.   Evergreen shrubs should be planted at a maximum of 4' on center.
      (3)   Combination of Materials. Plant material may be used in conjunction
with fences, walls and berms but the overall effect shall be a continuous 100%
opaque screen at maturity. Plants may be planted in rows or be staggered, but
the overall effect shall be a 100% opaque screen.
      (4)   Fences. Fences should be used where appropriate to create an
effective screen between incompatible uses. Fences to be used as screens should
be approved by the Planning Commission during review of the landscape plan and
shall be in conformance with regulations as established in Section
1125.12 .
(Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13; Ord. 2020-04-CD. Passed 12-8-20.)
   1145.06 SCREENING AND BUFFERING REQUIRED.
   In order to provide protective screening and buffers for residential areas
adjacent to nonresidential areas, the Planning Commission shall require a wall,
fence or greenbelt to be provided by the nonresidential property owner in
accordance with the following:
   (a)   Screening areas shall be provided for the purpose of minimizing the
friction between incompatible land uses and improving the aesthetic and
functional quality of new development.
   (b)   Where vegetative and/or topographic conditions that provide a natural
screening and buffer exist prior to development of properties in question,
every effort shall be made to retain such conditions. In such cases, additional
screening may not be required, provided that provision is made for maintenance
of such areas.
   (c)   The Board of Zoning Appeals (or the Planning Commission, as part of
the Site Plan Review process), may waive the requirement for a wall, fence or
greenbelt if equivalent screening is provided by existing or planned parks,
parkways, recreation areas or by topography or other natural conditions.

effective date of this ordinance is changed or enlarged in floor area, number
of employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity or otherwise to create
a need for an increase of ten (10) percent or more in the number of existing
parking spaces, such spaces shall be provided on the basis of the enlargement
or change. Whenever a building or use existing prior to the effective date of
this ordinance is enlarged to the extent of fifty (50) percent or more in floor
area or in the area used, the entirety of such building or use shall then
comply with the parking requirements set forth herein.
(Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13.)
   1147.02 OFF-STREET PARKING AND DESIGN STANDARDS.
   All off-street parking facilities including entrances, exits, circulation
areas and parking spaces shall be in accordance with the following standards
and specifications:
   (a)   Parking Space Dimensions. Each off-street parking space shall have an
area of not less than 162 square feet exclusive of access drives or aisles and
shall be of useable shape and condition. All parking spaces must be a minimum
of nine (9) feet wide and eighteen (18) feet long. Stacking spaces for drive-
through windows must provide a space equal to the required parking space size.
   (b)   Access. There shall be adequate provisions for ingress and egress to
all parking spaces. Where the lot or parking spaces do not provide direct
access to a public street or alley, an access drive shall be provided, with a
dedicated easement of access as follows:
      (1)   For single family detached dwellings or two family dwellings, the
access drive shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet in width.
      (2)   For all other uses, the access drive shall be a minimum of twenty
(20) feet in width.
      (3)   All parking spaces, except those required for single family
detached dwellings and two family dwellings, shall have access to a public
street or alley in such a manner that any vehicle leaving or entering the
parking area from or into a public street or alley shall be traveling in a
forward motion.
      (4)   Parking for uses not permitted in a residence zone shall not be
permitted in a residence zone, nor shall any Residence District property be
utilized as access for uses not permitted in that Residence District.
   (c)   Setbacks. Except for paved driveways with a maximum width of 20 feet
that lead to an attached garage or carport, no parking shall be permitted
within the required front yard of a single family or two-family residence.
Parking and vehicular use areas for non-residential uses and multi-family
dwellings shall be located a minimum of ten (10) feet from the right-of-way
line or access easement and at least five (5) feet from a side or rear property
line. Front parking setback areas shall be landscaped according to the
regulations for streetscape bufferyards as established in Chapter 1145.
   (d)   Screening. Off-street parking areas for more than five (5) vehicles
shall be effectively screened on each side which adjoins or faces any premises
situated in any residence district or institutional premises, by a masonry wall
or a solid fence of acceptable design. Such wall or fence shall not be less
than four (4) feet nor more than six (6) feet in height, and shall be
maintained in good condition without any advertising. The space between such
wall or fence and the lot shall be landscaped with grass, hardy shrubs or
evergreen ground cover, and maintained in good condition, free of debris and
weeds. In lieu of such wall or fence, a strip of land not less than fifteen
feet in width and planted with an evergreen hedge or dense planting of
evergreen shrubs not less than four (4) feet in height may be substituted and
this shall be maintained in good condition.
   (e)   Paving. Every off-street parking lot including aisles, access drives
and parking spaces shall be surfaced with an asphaltic or Portland cement
binder pavement providing an all-weather, durable, and dustless surface.
Pervious pavement materials, including pervious pavers, pervious concrete or
asphalt, and interlocking grass pavers may be utilized for required parking
spaces. Provided that the location of the pervious pavement shall not be
permitted for use in any loading area or as part of any access drive providing
access to the property or to any loading area.
   (f)   Drainage. All parking spaces, together with driveways, aisles and
other circulation areas shall be graded and drained so as to dispose of surface
water which might accumulate within or upon such area, and shall be designed to
prevent the excess drainage of surface water onto adjacent properties, walkways
or onto public streets. Adequate arrangements shall be made to insure
acceptable diversion to an adequate storm water drainage system. Interior
landscaped areas may be used for surface drainage when employing stormwater
best practices design approved by the Hamilton County Stormwater District or
other appropriate regulating body.
   (g)   Barriers. Wherever a parking lot extends to a property line, fencing,
wheelstops, curbs or other suitable barriers shall be provided in order to
prevent any part of a parked vehicle form extending beyond the property line
and from destroying the screening materials.
   (h)   Visibility.  Access of driveways for parking areas shall be located in
such a way that any vehicle entering or leaving such parking area shall be
clearly visible by any pedestrian or motorist approaching the access or
driveway from a public street, private street or alley.
   (i)   Marking.  All parking areas, excluding those for single family
detached dwellings and two family homes, shall be marked with paint lines, curb
stones or in some other manner approved by the Village and shall be maintained
in a clearly visible condition.

   In computing the number of parking spaces required by this Code, the
following shall apply:
   (a)   Where floor area is designated as the standard for determining parking
space requirements, floor area shall be the sum of the gross floor area of a
specified use.
   (b)   Where seating capacity is designated as the standard for determining
parking space requirements, the capacity shall mean the number of seating units
installed or indicated for each twenty-four (24) lineal inches of seating
facilities.
   (c)   Fractional numbers shall be increased to the next highest whole
number.
   (d)   Parking space requirements for a use not specifically mentioned in
this Code, shall be determined by using the most similar and restrictive
parking space requirement as specified by the Planning Commission.
   (e)   When the building floor area is designated as the standard for
determining parking space requirements and that number is less than the minimum
standard, at least one parking space shall be provided on the premises.

Village, and as such are detrimental to the public health, safety and general
welfare of the Village.

and private streets have a need to identify themselves and their activities to
motorists and pedestrians by means of signs.

         B.   In the case of a user or multiple development located on a corner
lot, the aforesaid minimum frontage shall be computed by adding together the
frontages on each abutting street or road.
         C.   If the premises upon which a freestanding sign is erected
fronting on more than one public street, other than a corner lot, the street
frontage nearest the sign(s) shall be used in determining the maximum number of
permitted signs on such streets.
      (5)   Display surface area for ground signs:
         A.   The sign area for a ground sign shall not exceed fifty (50)
square feet per display area. More than one display surface shall only be
permitted when such surfaces are placed “back to back” and cannot be viewed at
the same time.

of display surfaces of a ground sign shall include all the display surfaces of
any individual signs identifying separate uses in such multiple development.

sites and/or businesses may present unique characteristics, including shape and
location, and the design of existing and proposed structures could be best
developed through the application of alternative signs or standards which
depart from the requirements of this Section. In such cases, the Planning
Commission may approve alternative signs or standards for on-premises and
temporary signs, contingent upon finding that the alternative signs or
standards will:
      (1)   Result in a site and/or business having a visual character which is
as compatible, or more compatible, with adjacent sites and/or businesses than
anticipated by the requirements of this Section.
      (2)   Encourage a development trend or a visual character similar to that
anticipated by the requirements of this Section.

   1149.07 FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTION.
   (a)   Purpose. It has never been the intent of the Village of Greenhills to
infringe on the rights of property owners and occupiers to display messages
protected by the First Amendment. Therefore, this Section is adopted in order
to clarify the existing regulations and to remove any doubt that it is the
public's right to receive and display First Amendment protected messages,
including, but not limited to, religious, political, economic, social and
philosophical messages. It is the further purpose to reaffirm that an expedient
appeal process exists that addresses these First Amendment concerns.
   (b)   Definitions. For purposes of Chapter 1149, "First Amendment Protected
Speech Message" shall mean any message that is not intended to convey a
commercial message. "First Amendment Protected Messages" include, but are not
limited to, religious, political, economic, social, and philosophical messages.
A "Commercial Message" is one that is intended to call attention to a business
or promote the sale of any goods or services.
   (c)   Conflict with Existing Provisions.  In furtherance of the purpose of
this section, if there is any conflict between the provisions of this Section
1149.07, with any other section of the Zoning Code, including any other
provisions of
Chapter 1149  regulating signs, and such conflict could be construed to
infringe on First Amendment protected messages, the provisions of this Section
1149.07, shall control.
   (d)   First Amendment Safeguards. In order to safeguard the protections
offered by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, the following
regulations shall apply:
      (1)   Signs permitted to be displayed under this Section
1149.07 shall not be placed any closer than five feet from any side or rear
property line. No such signs shall be permitted in the right of way. Any sign
placed in the right of way may be removed and stored by the Village of
Greenhills without prior notice. It is the responsibility of the property owner
to properly identify the location of a right of way line. Failure to remove a
sign from the right of way shall not waive the Village's future right to remove
such sign or any other sign placed in the right of way.
      (2)   All signs must be maintained in good and safe condition. If the
signs permitted under this Section
1149.07 are not maintained in good and safe condition, notice shall be sent to
the property owner by regular mail. The property owner shall have seven (7)
days from the date of mailing indicated on the notice to restore or replace the
sign to a good and safe condition. If the sign is not restored to good and safe
condition within seven (7) days, and the owner or occupant of the property has
not filed an appeal from the notice, then the owner and/or occupant shall be in
violation of this Section and guilty of a minor misdemeanor. Each day that the
sign remains in violation of the notice to remove is a separate violation. No
additional notices shall be required.
      (3)   Every parcel that is permitted to display a sign containing a
commercial message or other permitted message pursuant to the Zoning Code shall
be permitted to display a First Amendment Protected Message in lieu of the
permitted commercial or other permitted message. However, this provision shall
not apply to existing signs displaying a message necessary for public safety,
such as messages directing vehicular or pedestrian flow, parking restriction
signs, or fire lane signs. Whether a sign displays a commercial message or a
First Amendment Protected Speech message, each sign shall still be subject to
the dimensional regulations imposed in each zoning district, including, but not
limited to, size, height, area and setback. Signs with the First Amendment
Protected Speech Message displayed in lieu of a commercial message shall be
permitted in addition to signs displaying the First Amendment Protected Message
permitted by this Section
1149.07.
   (e)   Signs Not a Principal Use. Signs shall be considered an accessory use
and regulated as an accessory use pursuant to underlying zoning district
regulations. However, signs authorized by this Section
1149.07 shall be permitted to be displayed by the owner on undeveloped lots.
   (f)   Exemption from Sign Permit Requirements. Signs authorized by this
Section 
1149.07 and real estate signs permitted by the zoning code are exempt from
obtaining a sign permit required under Section
1149.12.
(Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13; Ord. 2016-07-L&R. Passed 10-25-16.)
   1149.08 MAINTENANCE OF SIGNS.
   All signs, in all Districts, and the immediate surrounding premises shall be
maintained by the owner of such sign or signs or his agent in a clean
condition, free and clear of all rubbish and weeds.
(Ord. 2013-04-CD. Passed 4-2-13; Ord. 2016-07-L&R. Passed 10-25-16.)
   1149.081   ABANDONMENT OF SIGNS.
   (a)   If any sign is abandoned for a period of at least 90 consecutive days
in any 12 month period, such sign shall be a nuisance affecting or endangering
surrounding property values and be detrimental to the public health, safety and
general welfare of the Municipality and shall be abated.
   (b)   Such sign shall be abated within 60 days of notification by the Zoning
Officer either by:
      (1)   Removing the sign in question. Removal includes the total
disassembly of the sign structure including the base and/or the bracket or
other form of attachment, to the grade or surface on which the sign was
erected, mounted or affixed. The property owner shall paint over painted wall
signs so the original sign is not visible and completely blocked. The entire
wall shall be painted if the color of paint use to block out the painted sign
does not match the color of the wall. Any sign not removed within the specified
60-day time period may be removed by the Municipality at the property owner's
expense and assessed to that property owner on the next County Property Tax
Statement.
      (2)   Altering the sign and its structure so that it conforms to the
regulations and provisions of this Code.
         (Ord. 2015-07-L&R. Passed 10-27-15.)
   1149.09 APPEALS AND VARIANCES FOR DENIAL OF SIGN PERMIT.
   In order to confirm a property owner's ability to exercise his or her First
Amendment rights without undue delay, a special process shall be instituted for
the appeal of the denial of a Sign Permit for any sign. To the extent that the
appeal process of this section conflicts with the provisions of Chapter 1151 of
the Zoning Code, the appeal process of this Chapter 1149 shall control.
   (a)   It shall be the duty of the Zoning Inspector to either approve or deny
applications for Sign Permits for signs within seven (7) business days of the
date of application. Any aggrieved applicant shall have the right of appeal the
denial of a Sign Permit. Such appeal shall be heard by the Board of Zoning
Appeals (“BZA”) with the following limitations:
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to authorize a
variance from the strict application of the provisions of this Chapter upon
appeal by reasons of exceptional narrowness, shape, topographic conditions, or
other extraordinary situation, in order to relieve the undue hardship, provided
that the variance can be granted without substantial detriment to the public
good and does not substantially impair the intent of these regulations. No
variance shall be granted unless the Board finds that the special circumstances
or conditions applying to the building or land in question are peculiar to such
lot or property, and do not result from the actions of the applicant and do not
apply generally to other land or buildings in the vicinity.
      (2)   The Board may not grant any variances whose effect will be to
continue or to permit a hazard to public safety.
   (b)   Any such appeal must be taken within ten (10) days after the decision
of the Zoning Inspector by filing a notice of appeal, stating the grounds for
such appeal, with the Zoning Inspector and the BZA. In the alternative, it
shall be sufficient to satisfy this requirement to present the notice to the
Municipal Manager who shall cause the notice of appeal to be promptly delivered
to the Zoning Inspector and the BZA. The Zoning Inspector shall transmit to the
BZA all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from
was taken.
   (c)   The Board shall fix a time for the hearing of the appeal not sooner
than fifteen (15) days and not later than thirty (30) days from the filing of
the notice of appeal. The Board shall give at least ten (10) days' notice in
writing to all interested parties and give notice of such public hearing by one
publication in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the Village at
least ten (10) days before the date of the hearing. The appealing party has the
right to waive any and all of the time restrictions imposed on the Board.
However, absent such waiver, failure of the Board to act within these time
limitations shall be deemed an approval of the application for the Sign Permit.
   (d)   The Board shall render a written decision on the appeal not later than
fourteen (14) days after the date of the public hearing.

   (b)   Jurisdiction.  The Board shall have the following powers:
      (1)   Administrative Appeals. To hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged there is an error in any interpretation, judgment, decision or
determination made by the Zoning Official in the administration and enforcement
of the provisions of these regulations.
      (2)   Variances.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to
authorize upon appeal in specific cases, filed as hereinafter provided, such
variances from the terms, provisions or requirements of this Zoning Code as
will not be contrary to the public interest provided, however, that such
variances shall be granted only in such cases where, owing to special and
unusual conditions pertaining to a specific piece of property as described
below, the literal enforcement of the provisions or requirements of this Zoning
Code would result in practical difficulty in the case of an area variance or
undue hardship in the case of a use variance, so that the spirit of the Zoning
Code shall be upheld, public safety and welfare secure and substantial justice
done. Variances shall not be granted for uses not permitted in the zoning
district applicable to the property.
         A.   Conditions Prevailing. Where there are exceptional or
extraordinary circumstances or conditions, the literal enforcement of the
requirements of this Zoning Code would involve practical difficulty in the case
of an area variance or would cause undue hardship in the case of a use
variance, unnecessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of this chapter, the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall have power to relieve such circumstances or
conditions. In authorizing a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach
thereto such conditions regarding the location, character, and other features
of the proposed structure or use it as it may deem necessary in the interest of
the furtherance of the purpose of the chapter and in the public interest. In
authorizing a variance, with attached conditions, the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall require such evidence and guarantee or bond as it may deem to be
necessary, to enforce compliance with the conditions attached. In determining
whether or not practical difficulties exist, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
consider the following criteria:
            1.   Whether the property will yield a reasonable return without
the variance or whether there can be beneficial use of the property;
            2.   Whether the variance is substantial;
            3.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
            4.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services;
            5.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with
knowledge of the resolutions, ordinances, regulations, measures and orders,
including the fact that all property owners are presumed to have actual or
constructive knowledge of such information, and that a claim by a property
owner to have no knowledge of such information shall not be a reason standing
alone to grant a variance;
            6.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be
obviated through some method other than variance; and
            7.   Whether the spirit and the intent behind the resolutions,
ordinances, regulations, measures and orders would be observed and substantial
justice done by granting the variance.
         B.   Findings of the Board of Zoning Appeals. No such variance of the
provisions or requirements of this Zoning Code shall be authorized by the Board
of Zoning Appeals unless the Board of Zoning Appeals finds that all of the
following facts and conditions exist and they determine that the hardship was
not self-created:
            1.   Exceptional Circumstances. Where, by reason of the exceptional
narrowness, shallowness, or unusual shape of a specific piece of property on
the original effective date of this Zoning Code (March 15, 1966), or by reason
of exceptional topographic conditions, or other extraordinary situation or
condition of such piece of property, or of the use or development of property
immediately adjoining the piece of property in question, there are exceptional
or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to the property in
question or to the intended use of the property, that do not apply generally to
other properties or classes of uses on the same zoning district.
            2.   Preservation of Property Rights. That such variance is
necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights
which are possessed by other properties in the same zoning district and in the
same vicinity.
            3.   Absence of Detriment. That the authorizing of such variance
will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property, and will not
materially impair the purposes of this Zoning Code or the public interest.
            4.   Not of General Nature. That the condition or situation of the
subject property, or the intended use of the property, for which variance is
sought, is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably
practical the formulation of a general regulation for such condition or
situation.
      (3)   An application for an Appeal or Variance shall contain the
following information:
         A.   Name, address and telephone number of the applicant.
         B.   A brief narrative description of the existing use of the
property.
         C.   Statement of location of the property (subdivision, township,
range, section number, lot number).
         D.   A statement indicating the zoning of the property.
         E.   A brief narrative description of the proposed appeal or variance
being requested, citing the section of the Zoning Code from which the appeal or
variance is being requested.
         F.   A plan, drawn at an appropriate scale, showing the following:
            1.   Location of the property, indicating all existing and proposed
structures and lot lines.
            2.   Locations of the nearest public rights-of-way and location of
all access points to the site, existing or proposed.
            3.   Locations of any easements existing or proposed.

these regulations.
         G.   Such other information as may be required by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
         H.   Names and mailing addresses of owners of property adjacent to the
subject property as recorded by the Hamilton County Auditor's Office.
         I.   Notification. A reasonable time will be fixed for the hearing of
the application for appeal, giving ten (10) days' notice in writing to the
parties of interest and giving notice of such public hearing by publication in
one or more newspapers in general circulation in the Village at least (10) days
before the date of such hearing.
         J.   Fees. Each application for appeal shall be accompanied by a check
or money order, payable to Greenhills, in the amount to be determined and set
by Village Council to cover the cost of publishing and/or posting and mailing
the notice of the hearing or hearings and other expenses in conjunction
therewith.
      (4)   Appeal of Board of Zoning Appeals Decision. Any party aggrieved by
a decision of the Board of Zoning may appeal within thirty (30) days of the
date of decision to the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County on the ground
that such decision was unreasonable or unlawful.

   1151.07 SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   Site plan review shall be as follows:
   (a)   Applicability.
      (1)   This section shall apply to new property development and any
collective substantial expansion of existing structures, except for individual

      (4)   Existing topography with a maximum of five (5) foot contour
intervals.
      (5)   The proposed finished grade of the development shown by contours
not less than one (1) foot.
      (6)   The locations of all existing and proposed buildings in the
described parcels, the uses to be contained therein and the total number of
buildings including dimensions, heights, gross floor area and number of
stories.
      (7)   Location and dimension of all curb cuts, driving lanes, off street

   (c)   Site Plan Review Guidelines. The following principles shall guide the
exercise of site planning review by the Planning Commission:
      (1)   The natural topographic and landscape features of the site shall be
incorporated into the plan and the development.
      (2)   Buildings and open spaces should be in proportion and in scale with
existing structures and spaces in the area within three hundred (300) feet of
the development site.
      (3)   A site that has an appearance of being congested, over built or
cluttered can evolve into a blighting influence and therefore such should not
be congested, over built or cluttered.
      (4)   Open spaces should be linked together.
      (5)   Natural separation should be preserved or created on the site by
careful planning of the streets and clustering of buildings using natural
features and open spaces for separation. Existing vegetation removal should be
kept to a minimum.
      (6)   Screening of intensive uses should be provided by utilizing
landscaping, fences or walls to enclose internal areas.
      (7)   Buildings should be sited in an orderly, non random fashion. Long,
unbroken building facades should be avoided.
      (8)   In connection with the siting of mid rise and high rise buildings,
the location should be oriented to maximize the privacy of the occupants of
adjacent buildings.
      (9)   Street location and design shall conform to existing topographic
characteristics. Cutting and filling shall be minimized in the construction of
streets. Flat as possible grades shall be utilized proximate to intersections.
      (10)   Pedestrian circulation in non residential areas should be arranged
so that off street parking areas are located within a convenient walking
distance of the use being served. Handicapped parking should be located as near
as possible to be accessible to the structure. Pedestrian and vehicular
circulation should be separated as much as possible, through crosswalks
designated by pavement markings, signalization or complete grade separation.
      (11)   Path and sidewalk street crossings should be located where there
is a good sight distance along the road, preferably away from sharp bends or
sudden changes in grade.
      (12)   Parking lots and garages should be located in such a way as to
provide safe, convenient ingress and egress. Whenever possible there should be
a sharing of curb cuts for more than one facility. Parking areas should be
screened and landscaped and traffic islands should be provided to protect
circulating vehicles and to break up the monotony of continuously paved areas.
      (13)   Drive through establishments such as restaurants and banks should
be located to allow enough automobile waiting space for peak hour operation
without interference with other parking lot circulations or vehicular traffic
on adjacent public streets.
   (d)   Action by Planning Commission for Site Plan Review.  
      (1)   Upon submission of the complete application for site plan review to
the Building/Zoning Official, the application shall be transmitted to the
Planning Commission where they shall review the site plan pursuant to
subsection (c) Site Plan Review Guidelines. No public notice or public hearing
shall be required in conjunction with the review, the approval, approval with
modifications or disapproval of the site plan. The Planning Commission may
approve, disapprove or approve with modifications the site plan as submitted.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall act upon all site plans within thirty
five (35) days after the receipt of the complete application from the Building/
Zoning Official. Within the said thirty-five (35) day period, a majority of the
members of the Planning Commission present at a meeting thereof may vote to
extend the said period for a period of time not to exceed an additional sixty
(60) days.
   (e)   Appeal of Planning Commission Decision for Site Plan Review.  An
appeal can be made to the Village Council regarding a decision by the Planning
Commission regarding approval of a site plan review. An applicant, or other
aggrieved party, may appeal to the Village Council to evaluate the decision of
the Planning Commission as related to a site plan review application. The
Village Council may uphold the decision of the Planning Commission, overturn
the decision of the Planning Commission or modify the decision of the Planning
Commission. An affirmative vote of three-fourths (3/4) of the Village Council
is required to overturn or modify the recommendation of the Planning
Commission.

premises upon which the building is located;
      (3)   Include a list of violations describing the nature with
particularity and reference to the provision or section of this Code violated;

   (b)   Authority of Building Inspector. The notice and order issued by the
Building Inspector pursuant to subsection (a) hereof shall contain a statement
of the acts required and the time period in which the action is to be completed
such that if:
      (1)   The Building Inspector has determined that the building or premises
shall be vacated, the order shall require the vacation within a reasonable time
from the date of the order as determined by the Building Inspector; or
      (2)   The Building Inspector has determined that the building shall be

to his last known mailing address, residence, or place of business; if no such
address is known, then a copy of the notice and order shall be mailed and
addressed to such person at the address of the building involved in the
proceeding; if a certified mail envelope is returned as unclaimed or refused,
the notice will be deemed properly served by regular mail as of the date of
mailing; if service is not accomplished by any of the above means, then
notification of the existence of the notice and order may be published at least

   1331.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the Village of Greenhills, State of Ohio
does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of Greenhills are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental service, extraordinary and
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely effect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and

assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 98-2L&R. Passed 2-17-98.)
   1331.02 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this Chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas. (Ord. 98-2L&R. Passed 2-17-98.)
   1331.03 DEFINITIONS.

consistent with the various conditions herein.
(Ord. 98-2L&R. Passed 2-17-98.)
   1331.04 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Applicability. This Chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood
hazard within the jurisdiction of Greenhills as identified by Federal Emergency
Management Agency, including any additional flood hazard areas annexed by
Greenhills that are not identified on the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map.
(Ord. 98-2L&R. Passed 3-23-04.)
   (b)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard have been identified by FEMA in the Flood Insurance Study
Hamilton County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas dated February 17, 2010. This
study, and associated Flood Insurance Rate Map Hamilton County, Ohio and
Incorporated Areas effective February 17, 2010 and any revisions thereto is
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this Chapter. The maps
are on file at 11000 Winton Road, Greenhills, Ohio 45218.
(Ord. 2010-2CD. Passed 1-5-10.)
   (c)   Compliance. Unless specifically exempted from filing for a development
permit as stated in Section
1331.05 (b), no structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered without full
compliance with the terms of this Chapter and all other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this Chapter.
   (d)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This Chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions. However, where this Chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (e)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this Chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of this Chapter may be in conflict with a
State law, such State law shall take precedence over the Chapter.
   (f)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This Chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This Chapter shall not create liability on the part
of Greenhills, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (g)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of this Chapter
or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall constitute a minor
misdemeanor. Any person who violates this Chapter or fails to comply with any
of its requirements (including violations of conditions of and safeguards
established in connection with conditions) shall upon conviction thereof be
fined or imprisoned as provided by the laws of the Village of Greenhills. Each
day a violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing
herein contained shall prevent the Village of Greenhills from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violations. The Village
of Greenhills shall prosecute any violation of this chapter in accordance with
the penalties stated herein.
(Ord. 98-2L&R. Passed 2-17-98.)
   1331.05 ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Establishment of Development Permit. A development permit shall be
obtained from the Zoning Inspector before construction or development begins
within any area of special flood hazard established in Section
1331.04 (b). Application for a development permit shall be made on forms
furnished by the Village of Greenhills and may include, but not be limited to:
site specific topographic plans drawn to scale showing the nature, location,
dimensions and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities and the location of
the foregoing. The following information is required:
      (1)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor,
including basement, of all proposed structures located in special flood hazard
areas where base flood elevation data are utilized;
      (2)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any proposed
structure will be flood-proofed in accordance with Section
1331.07(B)(2) where base flood elevation data are utilized;
      (3)   Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the flood-proofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the
flood-proofing criteria in Section
1331.07(B)(2) where base flood elevation data are utilized; and
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development and certification by a
registered professional engineer that the flood carrying capacity of the
watercourse will not be diminished.
   (b)   Exemption from Filing a Development Permit. An application for a
development permit shall not be required for maintenance work such as roofing,
painting and basement sealing, or for small nonstructural development
activities (except for filling and grading) valued at less than one thousand
dollars ($1,000). Any proposed action exempt from filing for a Development
Permit is also exempt from the standards of this Chapter.
   (c)   Designation of the Flood Damage Prevention Administrator. The Zoning
Inspector is hereby appointed to administer and implement this Chapter by
granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with its
provisions.
   (d)   Zoning Inspector Duties and Responsibilities. The duties and
responsibilities of the Zoning Inspector shall include but are not limited to:
      (1)   Permit review.
         A.   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this Chapter have been satisfied;
         B.   Review all development permits to assure that all necessary
permits have been received from those federal, state or local governmental
agencies from which prior approval is required. The applicant shall be
responsible for obtaining such permits as required including permits issued by
the Department of the Army under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
         C.   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located within a designated floodway. Floodways may be
delineated in other sources of flood information as specified in subsection (d)
(2) hereof. If the proposed development is located within a designated
floodway, assure that the encroachment provision of Section
1331.07(c)(1) is met.
      (2)   Use of other base flood elevation and floodway data. Areas of
special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency in accordance with Section
1331.04 (b), are designated as Zone A on the community's Flood Insurance Rate
Map. Within these areas, the Zoning Inspector shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal, state or other source including data obtained under Section
1331.07 (b)(6), in order to administer Section
1331.07 (b)(1) and (2) and (c).
      (3)   Information to be obtained and maintained. Where base flood
elevation data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on a
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map, regardless of the source of such data,
the following provisions apply:
         A.   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and record whether or not such structures contain an
enclosure below the lowest floor;
         B.   For all new or substantially-improved flood-proofed
nonresidential structures:
            1.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean
sea level) to which the structure was flood-proofed, and
            2.   Maintain the flood-proofing certifications required in Section
1331.05(a)(3).
         C.   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this Chapter.
      (4)   Alteration of watercourses.
         A.   Notify adjacent communities and the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Water, prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. A watercourse is considered to be altered if any change
occurs within its banks.
         B.   Maintain engineering documentation as required by Section
1331.05(a)(4) so that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse will not be diminished.
         C.   Require that necessary maintenance shall be provided for by the
applicant for the altered or relocated portion of such watercourse so that the
flood carrying capacity shall not be diminished.
      (5)   Interpretation of flood boundaries. Make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazards, for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions. When a map boundary and field
elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile
shall prevail. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
Section
1331.06.
(Ord. 98-2L&R. Passed 2-17-98.)
   1331.06 VARIANCE PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Greenhills Appeals Board as established by the Village of
Greenhills shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this Chapter.
      (2)   The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is
an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the Zoning
Inspector in the enforcement or administration of this Chapter.
      (3)   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board or any taxpayer, may
appeal such decision to the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas, as provided
in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
      (4)   In passing upon such application, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this Chapter, and:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (5)   Upon the consideration of the factors of subsection (a)(4) hereof
and the purposes of this Chapter, the Board may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
Chapter.
      (6)   The Zoning Inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
upon request.
   (b)   Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot one-half acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the items in subsection (a)(4) hereof have been
fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (2)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation and
restoration of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
      (3)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance shall not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this Chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in
subsection (a)(4) hereof, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure shall be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
shall be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation. (Ord. 98-2L&R. Passed 2-17-98.)
   1331.07 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (a)   General Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards the following
standards are required:
      (1)   Anchoring.
         A.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
         B.   All manufactured homes, if permitted now or in the future under
the Zoning Code, and if not otherwise regulated by the Ohio Revised Code
pertaining to manufactured home parks, shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors.
      (2)   Construction materials and methods.
         A.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
         B.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
         C.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering and accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
      (3)   Utilities. The following standards apply to all water supply,
sanitary sewerage and waste disposal systems not otherwise regulated by the
Ohio Revised Code:
         A.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems;
         B.   New and replacement sanitary sewerage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into flood waters; and
         C.   Individual wastewater treatment systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      (4)   Subdivision proposals.
         A.   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
         B.   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
         C.   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
damage; and
         D.   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall meet the specific standards of Section
1331.07(b)(6).
   (b)   Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base
flood elevation data have been provided as set forth in Section
1331.04 (b), Section
1331.05 (d)(2), or Section
1331.07 (b)(6), the following provisions are required:
      (1)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation.
      (2)   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level
of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall:
         A.   Be flood-proofed so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water to the level of base flood
elevation. In order to be eligible for lower flood insurance rates, the
structure should be flood-proofed at least one foot above the base flood
elevation;
         B.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
         C.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting the standards of this subsection. Such
certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section
1331.05(a)(3).
      (3)   Accessory Structures. An exemption to the elevation or dry flood-
proofing standards may be granted for accessory structures such as sheds or
detached garages, containing 576 square feet or less in gross floor area. Such
structure shall meet the encroachment provisions of subsection(c) hereof and
the following additional standards:
         A.   They shall not be used for human habitation;
         B.   They shall be designed to have low flood damage potential;
         C.   They shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as
to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of flood waters;
         D.   They shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation; and
         E.   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall
be elevated or flood-proofed.
      (4)   Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. To the extent that
they are now or may in the future be permitted under the Zoning Code, the
following standards shall apply to all new and substantially improved
manufactured homes not subject to the manufactured homes requirements of Ohio
R.C. 3733.01:
         A.   Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with
subsection (a)(1)B. hereof.
         B.   Manufactured homes shall be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base
flood elevation.
            These standards also apply to recreational vehicles that are either
located on sites for one hundred eighty (180) days or more, or are not fully
licensed and ready for highway use.
      (5)   Enclosures below the lowest floor. This provision applies to all
new and substantially improved residential and nonresidential structures which
are elevated to or above base flood elevation using pilings, columns or posts.
Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and
which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of flood waters. Specific design criteria are found in the National Flood
Insurance Program Rules and Regulations.
      (6)   Subdivisions and large developments. In all areas of special flood
hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided in accordance
with Section
1331.04 (b), or Section
1331.05 (d)(2), the following standards apply to all subdivision proposals,
including manufactured homes subdivisions, and other proposed developments
containing at least fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres (whichever is less):
         A.   The applicant shall provide base flood elevation data performed
in accordance with standard engineering practices,
         B.   If Section
1331.07(b)(6)A. is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section
1331.07(a) and (b).
   (c)   Floodways. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the
base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more
than one foot. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion
potential. The Flood Insurance Rate Map does not designate a floodway. However,
floodways may be delineated in other available sources of flood information as
specified in Section
1331.05 (d)(2). The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway
areas:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practices
demonstrates that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   If Section
1331.07(c), hereof is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of Section
1331.07(b).
      (3)   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevation can only be granted upon the prior approval by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Such request must be submitted by the
Zoning Administrator to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and must meet
the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.

   (a)   Licensing. A group home shall not be permitted to be constructed or
operated until the public agency or nonprofit institution operating such a home
satisfies the Municipal Manager that the home and its operation comply, or
within three months after the Municipal Manager grants a special permit will
comply, with all licensing or certification requirements of the Village and of
the appropriate State or County certifying agencies.
   (b)   Building, Fire, Health and Safety Standards. The group home shall meet
the building, fire, health and safety standards as set by State and local laws
and regulations applicable to such home. Sprinkling systems shall be required
of all group homes.
   (c)   Location. Group homes may be located in any of the zoning districts of
the Village except where residences are otherwise excluded, and subject to the
requirements of subsections (d), (g) and (h) hereof.
   (d)   Types of Dwellings. Group homes shall be established in two-family or
multiple dwellings converted entirely to group home use.
   (e)   Residential Character. The residential character of all structures
shall be maintained. The design of a proposed new structure and any proposed
remodeling of existing structures shall be permitted for uses in the district
in the event that the group home is discontinued, and shall not be detrimental
to the area because of substantial differences in exterior design or site
development.
   (f)   Off-Street Parking. The group home shall comply with the parking
requirements for the zone within which it is located and ensure that off-street
parking is available for hired staff.
   (g)   Spacing. In order to maintain the integrity of the existing
neighborhood, to prevent the creation of de facto social service districts and
to reduce any negative impact on neighborhoods and the community, no group home
shall be permitted within 2000 feet of the boundary lines of the property on
which another group home in the Village is located.
   (h)   Distribution. The total number of group homes shall be limited in
order to reduce the impact of group homes on any one area. The maximum number
of group homes shall be two per 500 multi-family residential dwelling units
located in the Village.
   (i)   Maximum Number of Residents Per Home. In order to ensure that these
facilities are not significantly larger than a single-family household in

shall not be more than six resident clients, and no more than eight total
residents exclusive of resident children of the staff.
   (j)   Operation. Each group home shall be operated by a public agency or a
nonprofit institution.
   (k)   Sponsoring Organization. Each group home shall be sponsored by a
religious, charitable, educational, civic or social service organization
located in Greenhills in order to facilitate communication with and support for
the home within the community. The sponsoring organization shall create an
Advisory Committee of at least five people who are residents of the Village,
which Committee shall include at least two interested persons who live within a
500 foot radius of the home, to advise the licensee of the group home
concerning the group home's operation within the community.
      (1)   Staff. The licensee of each group home shall employ a sufficient
number of qualified persons to provide the services which it offers in such a
way as to meet the standards and guidelines of these rules. No operator shall
knowingly employ a person of questionable character or reputation, or one whose
physical, mental or emotional health is such as to be a danger to the persons
under care.
   (m)   Preference. Residents of Greenhills and members of their immediate
family shall upon their request be given preference for placement as a resident
in any group home under this chapter; provided, however, that such residents or
family member meet all other qualifications for clients as established by this
chapter and the operators of the group home.
(Ord. 84-28C. Passed 7-17-84.)
   1333.04 SPECIAL PERMIT APPLICATION PROCEDURES.

Manager shall show that the proposed group home meets the standards and
guidelines previously listed, and shall include the names and addresses of all
owners of property abutting the lot on which the proposed group home is to be
located. In the event that the proposed group home does not meet the standards
and guidelines, the application shall expressly identify each standard or
guideline which the proposed home does not meet, and state the reasons that
such a failure to meet a standard or guideline does not have a negative impact
on the community.
   (c)   Site Plan. A site plan for the proposed group home shall be submitted
to the Municipal Manager for review. Such plan shall show the boundary lines of
the lot; the location, dimensions and use of structures on contiguous lots; the
distance in feet from the structures on contiguous lots and from other group
homes; all walks, drives and parking areas; all landscaping, existing and
proposed; and all proposed modifications to any structures on the lot.
   A statement from the applicant with respect to how the group home does or
will comply with the zoning ordinance requirements shall be filed with the site
plan.
   (d)   Operating Plan. Any application for a group home shall also include an
operating plan. Such plan shall include the name and background of the licensee
of the home; the ownership of the home; the ownership of the property and the
terms of lease or rental, if any; the name of the sponsoring organization; the
names of persons on the Advisory Committee; the nature of services to be
provided by the home; the number of residents and the nature of their
disabilities; the number of resident staff and their qualifications; the number
of nonresident staff and volunteers on each shift; the number of shifts;
anticipated traffic for such purposes as deliveries, off-premise therapy,
visitation by nonresident therapists, etc.; the approximate annual cost of
operation; and funding plans for such operation.
   (e)   Municipal Manager's Review. The Municipal Manager shall review any
application submitted to determine whether it contains the necessary
information as required in the above sections.
   The Municipal Manager or his designee shall examine the property to
determine if it is suitable for such use under the group home building,
sanitation and fire laws of the Village, County and State, and the regulations
set forth therein.
   The Municipal Manager or his designee shall evaluate the safety of access to
the property by streets and public sidewalks, availability of on-street
parking, placement of driveways, speed and density of existing traffic and
accessibility of public transportation.
   The Municipal Manager shall determine whether the requisite licenses have
been issued, or will be issued in due course, by the appropriate State or
County certifying agencies.
   In case of an initial application, if the required detailed plans have been
furnished, and if the application is otherwise properly submitted, the
Municipal Manager shall forward the application to the Planning Commission for
a report regarding the application.
   (f)   Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall approve the design
of a proposed new structure and the remodeling of an existing structure to
determine whether the structure will be feasible for permitted uses within the
district in the event that the group home is discontinued, and will not be
detrimental to the area because of substantial differences in materials,
exterior design or site development with other structures in the area.
   The Planning Commission may recommend conditions or restrictions upon the
construction, location and operation of the group home as shall be deemed
necessary to secure the general objectives of this chapter and the Zoning Code
and to ensure that such home shall not have a negative impact on the community.
   The Planning Commission shall issue a written report sixty days after
receipt by the Chairman of the Planning Commission of the application from the
Municipal Manager. The Municipal Manager shall forward such report, along with
the group home application, to Council. The Municipal Manager shall arrange for
Council to visit the location.
   (g)   Village Council. Before considering the issuance or renewal of a
special permit for a group home, Council shall hold a public hearing. Council
shall give thirty days notice of the time and place thereof in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Village, and shall notify by ordinary mail all
owners of property abutting the lot to be used for the proposed group home at
least fifteen days prior to the date of such public hearing. Council shall
consider the standards and guidelines established in this chapter, the group
home application, evidence presented at the public hearing and the Planning
Commission's report in making its determination. Council shall have the right
to request additional information to assist it in making its determination.
   Council may issue a special permit only if Council rules that the group home
does not, by nature or by reason of the requirements imposed by this chapter,
have a negative impact on the community. In making this determination, Council
shall consider the following factors:
      (1)   Impact on the community of permitting a group home to be located in
that particular location.
      (2)   Location and number of other group homes in the Village.
      (3)   Effect on property values.
      (4)   Need to maintain neighborhood characteristics.
      (5)   Needs of the residents of the community.
      (6)   Needs of the residents of the proposed group home.
      (7)   Effect on the public peace, health, safety, morals and welfare.
   If Council determines that a special permit for a group home should be
issued, it shall so instruct the Municipal Manager to issue the special permit.
   Council shall have the right to waive any provision of the standards and
guidelines as set forth, provided that Council rules that such waiver shall not
have a negative impact on the community or be injurious to the public health,
safety or general welfare of the community and of the residents and property
owners in the vicinity of the proposed home.

successes and any anticipated changes in operation.
   (c)   Renewal of Permit. Each licensee shall apply annually to the Municipal
Manager for renewals of its special permit not less than ninety days before the
expiration date of the permit. Before renewing any special permit for a group

notice of the time and place thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in
the Village, and shall notify by ordinary mail all owners of property of
abutting the lot to be used for the proposed group home at least fifteen days
prior to the date of such public hearing. Council shall review such renewal
request, and if continuing compliance with this chapter and the terms of the
special permit is found, the special permit shall be renewed.

CHAPTER 1335
Rental Dwellings and Units
1335.01   Permits.
   1335.01 PERMITS.
   (a)   No owner of residential real property located within the Village shall
rent, or seek to rent, any dwelling or dwelling unit in such real property for
any form of consideration unless he or she holds a valid Conditional Rental
Permit or Rental Permit issued by the Office of the Municipal Manager in the
name of the Owner and for the specific dwelling or dwelling unit for rent. The
term "Owner" shall have the same meaning as defined in Section
1321.011.
   (b)   (1)   A Rental Permit shall be valid for a three (3) year period
except as provided hereinafter. An Owner shall be required to obtain a new
Rental Permit at the expiration of the three (3) year period. Except as
provided hereinafter, a Conditional Rental Permit shall be valid for the period
specified in the Conditional Rental Permit as set forth in subsection (i)(2)
herein.
      (2)   If, during the time period specified above, the occupancy of the
dwelling or dwelling unit for which the Rental Permit or Conditional Rental
Permit has been issued transfers from one tenant to another ("Transfer of
Occupancy"), the issued Rental Permit or Conditional Rental Permit shall expire
and the Owner shall be required to obtain a new Rental Permit or Conditional
Rental Permit. The Owner shall have two (2) weeks after the transfer of the
occupancy of the dwelling or dwelling unit to apply for a new Rental Permit or
Conditional Rental Permit. If an Owner fails to notify the Office of the
Municipal Manager of a Transfer of Occupancy within two (2) weeks, the Rental
Permit or Conditional Rental Permit for the dwelling or dwelling unit in which
the occupancy has changed shall be deemed revoked and the Owner shall be
subject to the penalties contained in subsection (o) herein. A submitted
application and payment of fees by an Owner for the renewal of a Rental Permit
or Conditional Rental Permit shall operate as authority for the Owner to rent
the dwelling or dwelling unit for which the Renewal Application has been made,
until such time as the office of the Municipal Manager denies or issues a
subsequent Rental Permit or Conditional Rental Permit.
      (3)   A residential property will not be required to be inspected for a
new Rental Permit or Conditional Rental Permit upon a Transfer of Occupancy if
the dwelling or dwelling unit has been inspected and approved for occupancy
within the three hundred sixty-five (365) days prior to the transfer of
occupancy. In such event, the Rental Permit or Conditional Rental Permit shall
expire at the end of the period specified in the prior Rental Permit or
Conditional Rental Permit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a dwelling or
dwelling unit shall be required to be inspected if written complaints about the
condition of the dwelling or dwelling unit have been filed with the Village, by
the occupants of the dwelling or dwelling unit during the preceding one sixty
(60) days prior to the Transfer of Occupancy.
   (c)   An Owner shall apply for Rental Permit or Conditional Rental Permit by
filing a written application with the Office of the Municipal Manager which
contains the following information: (1) Name of Owner; (2) address of Owner;
(3) address of property to be inspected; (4) date of change of ownership or
Transfer of Occupancy, if applicable; (5) any other information reasonably
requested by the office of the Municipal Manager including all information
required by subsection (d) herein.
    (d)   The application for a Rental Permit or Conditional Rental Permit
shall be in affidavit form, and the Owner shall be required therein to answer,
to the best of his/her knowledge, all pertinent questions with respect to the
conformance of the subject property to this chapter and to all other applicable
ordinances, rules, and regulations related to the construction, condition and
appearance of the dwelling or dwelling unit. Within two (2) weeks of the
effective date of this section, any Owner currently renting or seeking to rent
a dwelling or dwelling unit within the Village must submit an application as
required by this section. The initial Rental Permit or Conditional Rental
Permit shall be issued by the office of the Municipal Manager as soon as
feasible after the Village Code Official has had an opportunity to conduct an
on premises inspection and the office of the Municipal Manager has determined
that the dwelling or dwelling unit complies with the applicable provisions of
this Chapter.
   (e)   (1)   Prior to issuing a Rental Permit or Conditional Rental Permit,
the Office of the Municipal Manager shall request an inspection of the dwelling
or dwelling unit by the Village Code Official or his/her designee (except as
provided under subsection (b)(3) herein). If the property owner, after being
given seven (7) calendar days to voluntarily consent to a request to make the
subject property available for inspection, refuses to voluntarily consent to an
inspection, the Village Code Official may seek an administrative search warrant
for the premises in order to complete the inspection, prior to the issuance of
the permit. For the purposes of this administrative search warrant, probable
cause in the criminal law sense is not required. Probable cause justifying the
issuance of an administrative search warrant may be based not only on specific
evidence of an existing violation, but also on a showing that reasonable
legislative or administrative standards for conducting an inspection have been
satisfied with respect to the particular property, including but not limited to
the passage of time, the nature of the building, or the condition of the entire
area.
      (2)   A dwelling or dwelling unit shall not be required to be inspected
by the Office of the Municipal Manager in the event that the dwelling or
dwelling unit has not had any violation during the two (2) previous inspections
required under this subsection (e). In such event, the owner shall be entitled
to receive a new Rental Permit for the period specified in subsection (b)
herein without an inspection. Thereafter, the dwelling or dwelling unit will
again be required to be inspected as provided herein.
   (f)   The Village Code Official shall inspect the dwelling or dwelling unit
for compliance with all ordinances, rules and regulations applicable to the
construction, condition and appearance of the subject property, including
specifically the dwelling or dwelling unit's compliance with Sections
1321.20,
1321.21,
1321.22,
1321.23,
1321.26 and
1321.27 of the Village Uniform Housing Code and Chapters
909,
1311, and
1511 of the Village Codified Ordinances and the provisions of this Section. If
the Building Official determines, after inspection, that the property is in
compliance with the applicable Code sections, he/she shall certify the same to
the Office of the Municipal Manager.
   (g)   The Owner shall pay an application inspection fee as set forth herein.
For any dwelling or dwelling unit, an Owner shall pay an application fee of
thirty-five dollars ($35.00), or as determined by Council from time to time
pursuant to the most current fee schedule. For a structure in which there are
multiple dwellings or dwelling units, the application fee shall be five dollars
($5.00) for each dwelling or dwelling unit with a minimum application fee of
thirty-five dollars ($35.00). Any owner-occupied dwelling or dwelling unit
shall not be subject to an application fee, but each additional dwelling unit
in a structure will be charged a five dollars ($5.00) application fee with a
minimum application fee of thirty-five dollars ($35.00). The application fee
shall cover the cost incurred by the office of the Municipal Manager in
reviewing any application as well as the initial inspection which is required
under subsection (f) herein. In the event that any violation of the rules,
regulations and ordinances set forth in subsection (f) herein are found by the
building official and/or his designee, an additional inspection will be
required. This fee structure shall be reviewed annually by the Village Council
and adjusted if necessary and appropriate.
   (h)   The Office of the Municipal Manager or his/her designee shall issue a
Rental Permit to an Owner who:
      (1)   Pays the permit fee required in this section;
      (2)   Files a written application in accordance with this chapter;
      (3)   Secures the endorsements required by this section;
      (4)   Complies with this chapter and the rules, regulations and
ordinances applicable set forth in subsection (f) herein;
      (5)   Demonstrates that he/she does not have any outstanding fees due and
owing pursuant to this section and does not have any delinquent fines as the
result of a conviction for the failure to comply with
Chapter 1335 of the Greenhills Codified Ordinances.
   (i)   (1)   When an Owner has applied for a Rental Permit, and upon
inspection, the Building Official is unable to certify that the dwelling or
dwelling unit for which a Rental Permit is sought conforms to the requirements
of this chapter or the rules, regulations and Ordinances in the Condition for
Occupancy Checklist of subsection (f), the Office of the Municipal Manager may,
when the nonconformity in his/her opinion does not constitute an immediate
threat or danger to the health, safety, or public welfare of the community or
the inhabitants or potential inhabitants of the dwelling or dwelling unit,
issue a Conditional Rental Permit to the applicant. The office of the Municipal
Manager shall not grant a Conditional Rental Permit if the dwelling or dwelling
unit constitutes an immediate threat or danger to the health, safety or public
welfare of the community or the inhabitants or potential inhabitants of the
dwelling or dwelling unit. The denial of any such application shall be subject
to the appeal procedure provided for in this chapter.
      (2)   A Conditional Permit shall set forth the reasons why the dwelling
or dwelling unit do not conform to this chapter and the Condition for Occupancy
Checklist, and the time allowed for the Owner to secure conformity (which time
shall not exceed ninety (90) days). The Office of the Municipal Manager and/or
his/her designee may give notice of its intent to revoke the Conditional Permit
at any time if he/she determines that the continued nonconformity constitutes
an immediate threat or danger to the health, safety, or public welfare of the
community, or the inhabitants or potential inhabitants of the dwelling or
dwelling unit, or he/she may extend the period for securing conformity, if, in
his/her opinion, the continued nonconformity does not constitute a threat or
danger, which extensions shall not exceed an additional sixty (60) days
(“Extension Period”). If the Owner has not fulfilled the requirements under the
Conditional Rental Permit within the time specified in the Conditional Rental
Permit and/or the Extension Period, the Conditional Rental Permit shall expire.
If an Owner fulfills the requirements under a Conditional Rental Permit within
the time specified, the Owner shall be granted a Rental Permit which shall be
valid for a three (3) year period.
   (j)   Whenever, upon inspection of any dwelling or dwelling unit requiring a
Rental Permit or Conditional Rental Permit, the Building Inspector finds that
conditions or practices exist which are in violation of any provision set forth
in subsection (f) herein, the office of the Municipal Manager shall give notice
in writing to the owner of such violations. If the owner has not corrected the
violations within thirty (30) days of receiving notice from the office of the
Municipal Manager, the Municipal Manager shall give written notice to the owner
that the issued Rental Permit or Conditional Rental Permit shall be revoked
subject to the appeal process provided for in this chapter.
   (k)   Any decision by, or issue raised by action of, the Office of the
Municipal Manager under this chapter is subject to appeal to the Village
Council by filing a written notice of appeal within fifteen (15) days after
receipt of a written notice or letter by the Office of the Municipal Manager of
noncompliance or refusal to issue a permit. Village Council shall provide the
owner with written notice at least ten (10) days' prior to when it will review
the decision of the Municipal Manager, and such appeal hearing shall take place
at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Village Council within thirty (30) days
after receipt of the written notice of appeal. The final decision of Village
Council shall be stayed for thirty (30) days to allow the owner to seek
judicial review.
   (l)   Upon the proper filing of a written notice of appeal pursuant to
subsection (k) hereof, an administrative stay shall be issued such that no
Rental Permit or Conditional Rental Permit may be revoked until the conclusion
of the appeal process provided for in subsection (k) hereof.
   (m)   An owner may seek judicial review of an adverse decision by Village
Council in the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to the provisions
of Section 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code governing administrative appeals.
   (n)   A Conditional Rental Permit, or Rental Permit as provided in this
section is transferable only by notification to the Office of the Municipal
Manager. When an Owner transfers his or her interest in or control of a
dwelling or dwelling unit, he/she shall notify the Office of the Municipal
Manager in writing within five (5) days after the transfer. The notice shall
include the name and address and telephone number of the person who has
succeeded to his or her interest or control.
   (o)   An Owner who rents or seeks to rent, any dwelling or dwelling unit for
any form of consideration without a valid Conditional Rental Permit or Rental
Permit as provided herein shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor. Each day of
such violation shall be considered a separate violation. It shall not be a
violation of this Chapter to refuse to give voluntary consent to a requested
inspection.
